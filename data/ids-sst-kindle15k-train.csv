3174	98da5ed9dac2249879a999b40	 It 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since Christopher Walken kinda romanced Cyndi Lauper in The Opportunists .	3

6404	74f6c99ad9cd8f9530e23846a	 A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .	2
6405	dca9b33ac86aab189f4542813	 A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .	2

6407	5d0b17c2d4039898ff6f39b3f	 If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .	1
6408	dbf5c93d120501e5fbb80aa83	 This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '	0

6432	50bd1f94c1b6c46b786c23877	 There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .	1
6433	53c375f5063d0dc5cb9c84f02	 While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .	2

6438	69deee1b87ff3bc5f30fe38e4	 Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .	3

1281	A3UPRWP8HRQKDF	Wasn't expecting that when the hotel door opened what I didn't get was everything that happened in Philly. The next step should have been the doctor office	3

1283	A26JC9OM7R7B5G	So horrible. I'm so glad this was free. Wish the author could pay me for the time I wasted trying to read it.	0
1284	A37GCC410JYT17	Good writer with interesting characters but subject matter way too violent. Mind control drugs, torture, government corruption.  Doesn't leave you satisfied like an exhilarating romantic suspense.	1
1285	A3P9D9ZYQS5MMZ	I really enjoyed this book. Nicks story was heartfelt. Author writes a very VIVID story. I could clearly picture every paragraph.	4
1286	A2RAKTFXL9USEG	Different, you are not sure where the writer is going but it is an interesting journey.  Tough female character which always makes for a good read.  Looking forward to others.	3

1294	A1NB8TOO5UKL4T	If you enjoy the C.S.Lewis writings, you may not enjoy this book.  The author is highly critical of him.  Even the attempts to be positive seem to morph into criticisms.	1
1295	A1G6EE9U6P8ZLH	This was a good effort by the author, mr. Pirini. I did learn 2-3 things I did not know before, so I guess - worth it.	3

2396	A2Z47K4PIV8216	The was an overall good story. Well thought out plot. Pre planned marriage at end was a little overkill though.	3
2397	A2K9B14G5EQI8K	The tale follows the first 2 books beautifully. I loved the stark need to love the one that was meant for you.The tale deserves a 4 and 5th tale	4
2398	A2SCAB3VMPVQFH	This was one of my favorites in the Sullivan series.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.	4
2399	A317QL3C4E3T7T	This was a great book. I love a good mystery and this was a great one. Did not guess the outcome!!	4

2403	A16PBT50K9X7ZH	I want the rest! I can't wait to see how this ends. I love the different type of werewolf in this. Especially since they don't live like humans. Great story.	4
2404	A149I2WQQN2385	It was ok. The story line was good I just felt that it was missing something, like maybe a summed up ending.	2
2405	A1SUPQ1LUEPZ8A	Another great book by Barbara Leachman. This book was a little different than the other two books.  More involvement with the main characters lives.	4
2406	A2XZGXE16YAQKK	entertaining. Not as detailed as I would have liked, but it's short and sweet. Enjoyed what there was of it.	3

2413	A27O42Z9AWNR1X	What an unsettling concept. Although not fully explored, it gives a nice peek into this author's storytelling ability. Mr. Bollinger has a knack for the sinister.	4

2432	A1G7H87JKYZ4T4	Okay, but not the kind of book that I normally read.  Would not read Farmer again at this point in time.	2

2452	A1RRWGQSFWHQVK	The plot thickens, the characters develop, and it ends on an epic cliffhanger, leaving me (as usual) cursing the authors and waiting with bated breath for the next installment.	4

2875	A2SAAIYJ5IUD6U	Colleen Coble writes a good love story and this is no exception. The struggle to single parent and the interferring former mother-in-law are realistic problems to overcome.	4
2876	ACMTDD3HQKOIE	Strikes me as a 'less than quality' continuation of the 50 shades stories.  Bland and unimaginative for the most part.	2

2878	A2W2O3P4Z7IC24	Such an interesting story with a neat concept. Just the perfect length to open and close the plot, but leave you musing about it for hours afterward.	4

2882	A6L8TIXFCABL8	Great graphics! Awesome storyline! Zombies galore! What else can I say? Unless you're not a fan of graphic novels or comics, you won't be disappointed! Please publish the sequel soon!	4

2893	A352FSOF3WPGMZ	The information is interesting but the extremely poor grammar was a distraction.  I can only presume that the book was written in a foreign language and then very badly translated.	2
2894	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This ebook is hot to the touch, and it has a romance story to it. This is a series and hard to read just one.	4

3272	AXI2Q2XTNSJ65	An interesting read but that ending... Really was that necessary? Britain was successful, it is not necessary to turn the book into a tragedy.	3
3273	A1W734HYLY2EUP	I loved this romance story. Hot sex! However, at the end, I feel the story went dead. This story could have ended sooner and not dragged out so long.	3

3285	A2TI80BGL5UVY6	The stories were captivating. The stories stop as a cliff hanger to continue to read the series stories. I recommend Full Moon.	3
3286	A1RUGOMYCF8NF4	Was I so melodramatic and prone to misunderstanding in my distant 20s? I hope not. Anyway, the story isn't terrible, but it's not all that original either.	2
3287	A302U3ARHIKNG7	great book !!! good story line !!!Liked that it linked the main characters into the next couple books but wasn't solely about them.	4

3303	A1O2NK8PUZ9V9A	This was more of a mystery/suspense than romance. A page turner with a little paranormal haunting. The end was a little sad, but she can move on now.	4
3304	A2VSZ2U549LL72	I really could not make head or tales of this. I gave up after a few pages as it was not worth reading any more.	1

3321	A3CQ5980OVK9GQ	This was a pretty good short story. It's definitely a different take on Alice and wonderland. A cute fast little romance with a little steam in there as well.	3

3343	A1H5G6VPE7PTYJ	There is way too much talk & additional unnecessary paragraphs.  It was to me like something that the authors were paid for by the number of words used.	2

4524	A1CYMUAHPWCX0P	The author has an easy style, with some thought provoking contrasts between minimalism and frugality. More about attitude than a how to.	3
4525	A1IWBKRIGHV1K1	Doesn't worth the time you'll spend reading it!  Poor characters, lousy situation, ridiculous end! I don't like it at all!	0

5121	A2ZR35M7BMZ4AM	I liked the story, but seems to leave lots of unanswered questions.  It's missing details unless this is meant to be a series... It just leaves you wondering.	3
5122	AH4TX7XZA38Z4	There were a few grammatical errors, but nothing that deterred from the story. I really enjoyed it, and can't wait to read the next book in this series.	3

5137	AJ7XR494MS48P	What a beautiful story! The characters are charming and the story at times brought tears to my eyes.  Very highly recommended.	4
5138	A34XIADTSP15MN	It was an alright book with some good ideas but was maybe for a younger audience. It was a little too basic and moved very slowly.	2
5139	A2E876IYHEDFIY	Handsome boss, efficient female employee and watch the fire works. Always a good read especially when well written.  Keep up the good work.	4
5140	A2APHHSF0LXEG7	Well, kinda like the softer, step down version of Fifty Shades! But all in all, a very nice story...J.Lynn is the best, no wonder my admiration goes to her work...	4

5142	A38NEK2TIDYEIF	Was looking for a basic juicing book, and this fills the bill. Tasty healthy drinks made right at home. Recommended !	3
5143	A87I2G5ZKRDPQ	A really short story with the outcome being predictable.  More in-depth character development would have been appreciated. Don't think I'm going to keep this one in my library.	1

5145	ADSXU3955C2S7	I enjoyed this book.  It was very entertaining and had a few surprises.  I enjoy the lite humor on a long weekend	4
5146	A1WUD42VKWASYG	This one didn't hold my interest enough to make it through the book. I won't be reading any more by her.	1
5147	A2Y0U71LWG5W2B	Lol, great collection of western tales, I loved each and every one. From sweet romance to hot and spicy, but all with a HEA.	4
5148	A14B9XDEKM35V5	Not the popular blood and gore - it's real live scary without werewolves and vampires falling in love. I enjoyed it.	4

5151	A3503JDA6595TB	I can't think of anything I liked about it.  It did not answer any of my questions on how to use it.	1
5152	APREYR7XM6NI0	This is a short book with very sexually explicit scenes. It covered many emotions in such a short story.  This book will hold your attention so I recommend it.	4
5153	A2D9KOTN4EF3ZY	I thought the story line was original and I liked the twist at the end. An overall good, quick, easy, read. It wasn't dynamic, but a good paranormal romance.	2
5154	AMTLXUES2P01Y	HOT, HOT, HOT!!! This series is excellent,  and I do beleive this is my favorite.  Hot, stramy and some angst. You will not be disappointed.	4
5155	A3D62EY6YMCK9Z	Maybe I need to read it again but this didn't have a good flow to me. The book was ok though	2

5161	A22GGHISKRVAOX	I don't usually enjoy literature written in the third person, and this book was no exception, though it does have some good Christian overtones.	2
5162	A1RHK7XLZFBJWS	this book talks about how smoking could damage one's health. It's very important that people understand the negetive effect of smoking, and stay away from it.	4

5166	ARRCMQFUXKXB5	I found this to be a good story though it did move slowly. It also seemed like a repetition of a couple other books by different authors.	2

5178	A2CE7EN4TBTG38	Napoleon Bonaparte by Luke Grayson explores the genius of Napoleon and what a great military leader he truly was. A great read for history lovers.	4

5181	ACDC20IDGDYXA	This is my first time reading anything by this author!  I will certainly read some of her other stories! The story line is very good!	3
5182	A1H3MRXVL0HF80	Ghostly descriptions that both repulse the reader, yet grips them , almost forcing them to read on!  This was a great ghost story with a techno twist.	3
5183	A1S9Q93ULUO391	Just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. They combined three different stories to make one interesting tale. Looking forward to the next book.	3

5185	A2NQ5QACID1U71	Struggled to finish this. Lacked any emotion. Seemed to me the author felt they had to &#34;list&#34; as many sex acts as possible, without a story attached.	1
5186	A1OKS5Q1HD8WQC	Ellie is kidnapped and all hands are on deck - Claire is recovering in the rainforest and coming into her powers with the animails. Another great book!	3

5190	A1TUU2B85LX2L7	Every book is a treat to read.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.  Great supernatural series for any age.	4
5191	A38732AQPY0D9H	Haunted Cottage was a great read and fast moving.  I wanted to read more but main character moved away instead of following a love interest that was starting to develop.	4
5192	A29WFRQ6P5AZF5	I had previously read Murder in the Dark, and Photo Finish. This book topped them I felt genuine connections to the characters. GREAT BOOK	4

5201	A34FBIPS8V2EHF	R. E. Butler, is a great author along with M L Brier, A. B. Lee.  They are great authors for Shifter books.	4

5206	A27B4YL8WI7UDY	The story itself was interesting and added to original Shannara series, but it needed more backstory to be a stand alone novella.	2
5207	A1XO3LYB42A8OL	Short but interesting premise. Touches on long term relationship issues -- with self as well as spouse. would read another by this author	3
5208	A3BOB1LYJ7AZV7	I would read any book she writes. Loved this series so much that I've read it 3 times! Every character is this serieswas awesome.	4
5209	A1AZ1NXGGP6LDX	I didn't know what to expect from this books.  It is weird.  I can't imagine this actually happening but you never know.  Please do not try this at home.	3

5213	A2LVWM65B3RRGI	Nice book to start with. The recipes look delicious. I especially liked the 40meals in 4 hours plan at the end.	3
5214	A2T5JIW0F46ERR	THERE IS NOT OF ONE STORY,IT SWITCHES  PEOPLE SO MUCH THAT U CANT KEEP UP WITH IT. YOU FINISH ONE CHAPTER,AND THEN YOU'RE WITH NEW PEOPLE NEW PLACES NEW TIME	1
5215	A3PV2E6RXRS8EO	Still enjoying the Left series. I do wish the author would stop using the word &#34;hissed&#34; to describe how everyone talks. Apparently everyone &#34;hisses&#34; at each other when they speak	3
5216	A3421G7AC7QQLZ	Good story can't wait to see what happens in part two heard good things about it but then again I wouldn't expect less from this author	3
5217	A2M5C0ZSHMNF3I	I'd so love a summons lol This was a all around fun read!! I will read it again I'm sure!	3
5218	A1VCB72BLOPOOJ	Shaken and Stirred is a short story teaser.  I liked the storyline, but felt that the writing did not flow smoothly, and the erotic scenes were not to my taste.	2
5219	A1JYLGU1QLS3QC	This is a very light romance, predictable from the start. I never really connected with the characters, they seemed too one-dimensional to be interesting.	2
5220	ARVET37SOADAZ	Nice recipes but author spent more time on showing her family than actually provided original recipes.  Save your money search google and you will find everything in this book.	0
5221	A1EAX14BORUQW6	The book was a little more graphic than I like but the plot was interesting and I was truly surprised by the ending.  Karma.	2
5222	ADAX6C8WR6C7S	Just the right amount of humor, mystery and funny characters. A series well worth reading. Maggie and her cast of friends are fun to follow.	3
5223	AOMZWI5HD90PF	The story of the lovers, strangers and the attraction, chemistry described well in the story line. I would definitely recommend to friends for reading.	3
5224	AP88VLQWVS8HL	Yes, Twisted Paths begins in several directions continues along and resolves some of the storyline.  The characters are still warm and personable.	3
5225	AAW5GEPIV6G4M	This book held far more mystery to me than the first. There were lots of twists. I honestly can't wait to read book three.	3
5226	AH0MQKRH4M67Z	The book was good. It definitely held my attention. Loved the humor in it. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.	2
5227	ADGINJRP1J5T5	As far as free books go, it is ok. It is some of her earlier work so it is a little rough.	3
5228	A2VWYLWGKFC6GP	I liked it!!!! I wish i read the books prior. So i got them all and loved them too. A good read.	3
5229	A1UKWQAX6N2G66	This has a good mix of vampires, classic romantics, love stories, and great characters that you could relate to. it was pretty good for a free bundle.	3
5230	A32JD5LSWORJWK	Loved it. Especially the burglar part, hiding in the closet. LOL. I love reading m/m books. Thank you for a really good story.	3
5231	A9AUMPBN0EABH	Not as good as the first; but if there's a third I'll probably buy it and 5 more words required	2
5232	AYFLNV65AWGIP	This was so unbelievable and the characters were so unlikable. I can't believe I wasted time & money on this one. Save yours.	0
5233	A21VQWVLLGRNX9	This is the 2nd book in this series and it was just as bad as the first.. Just not good can't even explain it's just not good.. Don't bother	0
5234	AMNYQ2NB847XI	nice and easy to read i would tell my friends not the best off books but you could read it	3
5235	APH0AIQXSJ1CO	A little bit of north-south history, a lot of mystery. I enjoyed reading this book. Good strong characters and enough information to figure out who did it!	3
5236	ASQJ99LLRFH69	I love this series by LInda Castillo and recommend itThe characters are realistic and you learn about the Amish way of life which is fascinating.	3
5237	APO5P6U6EUJGJ	Nice story about life after losing your loved one.  Would have been nice to see the story go further and deeper.  Good quick read for passing the time away.	2
5238	A2N8XI9PTDAC3K	This book was great! There's a good combination or romance, suspense and action. The ending was perfect! Looking forward to more books from Nicole James	3

5241	A356K1MI6WSXPS	did not understand all the language but at least the losers became the winners in the end. otherwise what was the purpose fo the book.	2
5242	A2GZOCILY5LKFB	Lots of funny characters.  This can be read alone but makes a lot more sense if you read two other stories first.	3
5243	AQZION6BNALML	Reunions are always an interesting proposition. Don't we all want to be that special one? The one who is fondly remembered?	3
5244	A1SB2NP5EAYLT1	Couldn't get it to work according to instructions.  I have an eBook to post, but have not found a way to do it.	0
5245	A36DWMH78296TO	I wasn't a fan of the writing style nor was I a fan of the story line. Not a good read.	1

5247	ARRT859EYH7NK	This series will keep you up late reading and trying to finished. The second in installment is well written and does not disappoint.  Can't wait to read the third installment.	3
5248	A3361XGKYF17S3	I love military romances. They fall in love over letters they write each other.  I wished it was longer thru	3
5249	A33AZXFZW00STX	The characters arnt compelling.Just a basic zombie story.I won't bother with the rest of the book.I was so bored I didn't even finish reading this part	1
5250	A1WPQDW5RGAM9S	Too boring, too slow, too tourist. Just couldn't keep my attention. Needed spice or at least some heat but 40% thru book and still nothing. Couldn't finish.	0
5251	A2I67YA7SV69IJ	The story was an excellent read little short for my tastes,but really good. Looking forward to the next book with anticipation> Yea!!!!	3
5252	A1544EE561CCZ4	This was more like a porn novel, not a romance novel.  It was actually rather disgusting.  Nothing but explicit sex. A big waste of my time.	0
5253	ARL51FCRLN6GM	I really enjoyed The Second Chances Series. I liked how each book could be read alone...even though I read them all!	3
5254	A11WKPGWE5Q92N	Another insight into the lives of the characters I feel are friends and their hardships during this awful time in our history. A book I could not put down.	3
5255	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	Even tho it was a short story I still enjoyed reading it and it was made better at the low 99 cent cost too.	3
5256	A7PXWPISZHU2Z	Great story about the ups and downs of a marriage and separation, and wondering can you still be in love after so many years. Well written and very enjoyable. :)	3
5257	A13C53Z3ONTAIS	okay read but not a gripping story.  Still it was what I thought it would be so not too disappointed	2
5258	AB8OE7GWJNADK	It just seemed that Joe and Dottie Loudermilk were unbelievable as to the trouble that they found themselves in all the time.  I felt glad they were just short stories.	2
5259	A38KPXZZ1AXYKR	This could have been longer but it was still a nice ending to the story.  I liked how Landen seemed to get some closure!	3
5260	A350FKSZ6JD3AY	4 stars means it is a good read. Very few mistakes,although I do not hunt for them. I would rather enjoy the book.the story was set up nicely.	3
5261	A2WC3U93V68DXR	This was a slightly interesting quick read that took about 30 minutes. No real plot. Quick free read. It does have potential to be good story. Just too quick.	1
5262	A25W99L1SWIMWL	I would really like to know what Loki`s roll is in Cinderella life. Is he Prince Charming. I don't know	3
5263	A2TEZE9WMSUB5E	I don't know if &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; was written before or after this novella. The story is more or less the same, but at a much faster pace.	1
5264	A3B4UGI91NITTQ	Very complementary in both detail and contents. It was not what I thought it was about. It was worth reading.	3
5265	A6YARH67M2QTK	This was different.  Was not sure what to expect next as I read it.  Would definitely read more by this author.	3
5266	A38N6WZUYCV6V7	Quick summer read. Had romance, lead man with good intentions, but caveman attitude, after all he's a Sheikh. Happy ending, of course.	3
5267	A3NMO3K0QVQH66	I read all the books and I really liked that the author would thin of her readers and give an update on the couples.Nice touch.	3
5268	A37SZWL3R0LEQ3	this was a good read, but too short. I was enjoying very much. then suddenly it was over..hopefully there will  be another to continue the storyline..geniemackbrown	3
5269	A2P9IJCJKKR0LI	Just a boring little story with nothing to remedeem it. I don't think authors know what romance is. Sadly disappointing.	0
5270	AHGM54X55CCPQ	This book was OK it was not as good as I thought it would be I hope part 2 will be better.	2
5271	A17RDLSG056EPD	Glad this was free. There were some chuckles in it and memories from Grandmas day  some of the recipes would be fun to try, might have to do that.	2
5272	A1O5I7EWP3H4NM	pretty accurate. great writing. I thoroughly enjoyed this quick read. I always love reading about history and it is rare to find something with writing style that keeps me interested.	3
5273	A2Y99DSQKKJNZH	This was my 2nd or 3rd book I've read by Merabeth James.  I really enjoy her books.  I think you will enjoy it as well.  Keep 'em coming, Merabeth!!!!	3
5274	ANI9SIWM6S7NA	Totally kept my interest and left me wanting more.  Good character development that made me feel like I knew them.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.	3
5275	AABA9EEV7H6N2	Was okay. Would have liked a little more romance and emotional depth. But this author's writing style is good and pulls you right into the story.	2
5276	ABSVHABZ93XUL	This has no real plot. It's just words, drivel, and isn't worth downloading. It is too short, and doesn't ever get a true &#34;story&#34; started.	0
5277	A1BZ77ZXQ3INBJ	It was an okay book. Story line flowed smoothly but not as riveting as some books I have read, I will not likely read again.	2
5278	A1MPD7B83BMG55	I liked the book but I found myself skipping over parts at times. Just had no interest in a lot of the remedies. Did glean some things from it though.	2
5279	A1ZFZM37WBM40M	I enjoyed reading this collection.  I had been exposed to Ben Hopkin in the Darc series, so I knew what to expect as far as gore.	3
5280	A3PLNDCNSZTRQE	This book was ok, I didn't find it all that funny. I didn't get any hard laughs or chuckles, but I was able to finish.	2
5281	A1V7Q2KSXPCOPE	I got this book for free and really enjoyed it.  Love the two main characters and the banter between them. Sexy hot romance with alpha male and bdsm.	3
5282	AGWQJ0MK9C710	Very spooky short story. You really feel for the main character. His life is stopped short after losing his family, and then he finds the house. Fun little read!	3
5283	A2AQC5O25TK5N7	Passes the time but not really as entertaining as I had hoped.  Maybe a later book would be more to my liking.	1
5284	A3T7SC6W4KR44T	Great story, really enjoyed this book, looking forward to the second in the series.. Flew thru this one, great read	3
5285	A1ROMOZ4BR4UWC	It was just ok to me. The first one was so good - I thought 2 and 3 would be. I was disappointed.	2
5286	A3TRG9UDHCNNWT	I really enjoyed this book because it was unique and interesting. I was surprised, happy, and even frustrated which is exactly what should happen while reading a good book.	3
5287	A2M0JOQWQ0KAJO	Good well documented history.  Gives a nice perspective of the life and times of Christ.  Easy read.  I would recommend this book.	3
5288	A2263F1WASP2PG	Heartwarming Christmas story about family and finding meaning and contentment in life.  I enjoyed reading the story but was on the predictable side.	2
5289	A2XKX5TBB6WV00	I enjoyed this quick read and I liked the preview at the end for another book. It was interesting reading it from the detective's perspective.	3
5290	A2TS60D6XB4KBY	Wow it's like Fantasy Island meets BDSM! What more can I say? Other than I'm game to go. Must read on!	3
5291	A9R74H37XN10V	Just as I was getting into it it ended. Overall for a pilot it was good read and makes you want more.	3
5292	A33FRQNBKFBWHQ	a good quick read which gives a view of what it was like to be a pioneer traveling in wagons with all the dangers of that time	2
5293	A2ECTSC675NIKQ	Zero world building, no character building, disjointed story line and dialogue. Sex scenes while many are fast and non descriptive.	1
5294	A3ACY3PNJUBMC9	Had started to accumulate some colorful words which I don't care for. I believe that you don't have to have colorful words with a good story line.	1
5295	A2563FZK5F5BL5	For those of us who wonder if life would have been better had we had a second chance with our first love, this is a great story.	3
5296	A37H1SC3HG545F	This could definitely be 5 star material if it wasn't so short.  Hoping for a continuation. Good writing and good main character	3
5297	A24ZGALKRTN4FF	Basic hummus is extremely easy to make.  This book contains a lot of good recipes for making different flavors of hummus to please any palate.	3
5298	A2IYO0I7DACLJ9	I enjoyed the story.  The characters were interesting.  The last part of the book was really wordy.  It's like silly behavior.	2
5299	A1TKHWX1B3GA5V	It was a good read.  I am so glad she opened up to love and covering coming her past to closure.	3
5300	A3IDUOP3J8RP4W	This was shorter than I expected.  It was good but I expected more and of course I read the attached book prior.	2
5301	A3VMHYMNJR82QF	I don't like it. Not my kind of book at all. So corny..... drawn out and extremely boring I might add.	0
5302	A20IPJ4V9KO8E2	I enjoyed this sequel to the Glebe point series.  I love that the characters are more mature and interesting.  Story flowed well and I would definately recommend this book.	3
5303	A1ZGDPM6MJW0X9	I was not too impressed by this book.	1
5304	A1CHBNT96KKZR0	More character development needed!  How did they meet?  Where's the building up of the desire!  Needs more background to get me invested in the romance!	2
5305	ACKQ9GKD2I36V	Lots of adventures with friends to back you up. Some loveable characters that you wouldn't think  were so likeable at first.worth a read.	3
5306	A2ELTMJJ2ISFX8	This book was entertaining. I read it in two hours. I can't wait to see if there is a sequel. The characters were off the chain.	3
5307	A13HFVOMSERG7I	It kept me going, instead of putting it aside for long periods.  Liked the set-up, the characters and the plot.	3
5308	A3CHFD1N6XG3MR	Very short and only one story bcuz Dee when I thought there would be two.  fast read characters very believable.	2
5309	A2T3RXOLDN51LJ	This one was good.  However, I really enjoyed the 1st book in the series alot better.  I will definitely be reading the 3rd book in the series.	2
5310	A25RC2LBHICQGV	Not a novel but a good clean Christian historical fiction book. It is hard to find clean books. I liked it!	3
5311	A1J9QA23LF57RL	It is good for using the unit, in the begining.  But, there are still things that it doesn't show you.	3
5312	ARX9Z0S4IR9AD	Pretty good read. Drug in a few places, but overall, I would recommend it.  I do wish that there would have been more of a closing to the phantom child.	3
5313	A1NKLU4ZIAWMHI	Definitely  a good read. Would be a 4 or 5 star rating if there would have been editing before submission to correct typos and grammatical errors.	2
5314	A1HILYCT9UUNBT	really like Amber Kell writings. this is another good read. like the whole story line of the series ,keeps  me wanting to read the next installment.	3
5315	A2T87RJPJP54J9	One of the things I found most aggravating was the same usage of content in each of the three books.  Would I purchase another boo by Holt?  No.	2
5316	A34JKPASN34OM1	An ideal, realistic approach to a modern day romance. Prince charming is found where you're least likely to be looking	3
5317	A30GKSVMS0I419	Amazing book, I could read it over and over again. Now, I'm off to read the sequel. Can't wait. I would recommend this book to anyone. I loved it!!:)	3
5318	A2W4O9AZEZONKX	Easy to instal snaps it place. Works great when with wide screen to watch vids, Would recommend if using with the Kindle Fire HDX.	3
5319	A1CGEHL1OZJI62	I really enjoyed reading this. It's a great great book and a hard one to put down. I feel it's a great one for any hopeless romantic.	3
5320	A1I3CP8FQTLR8	Easy read, nice storyline with just a little bit of cheeseyness. Would be God for young readers and old readers.	2
5321	A2KRL2SHM6W8YF	Full of action , combat and sex .Toss in some dark  humor for good measure and there you have it....a darn good read	3
5322	ABDENH2VBYG6B	I think I'll be using parts of this book when we cover animals in class. For example when reading The Body we can check out the rhyme on leeches :-)	3
5323	A19TNJ81AKRXEO	Same words different cover, mostly redundant as far as instruction manuals go.  But just how much can you say about one product	2
5324	A3HPTYME8UKNN7	Very good mystery.  It kept my interest right through and I really liked to ending.  Good book to curl up with.	3
5325	A23NCKH61PJ22C	Cheesy story line and characters. If you took out the sex scenes it could stand on its own as a romance novel. Still liked it.	3
5326	A2L5FHP42KV69E	I'm really enjoying these books.It's a cool idea to contemplate what it would be like If humans did evolve to using more of their brain	3
5327	A2P56BAGUHR8IJ	A conflagration of pseudo scientific ideas interwoven with spiritual understanding to create a page turning story of adventure, archeology, secretive under ground bases, love, and saving humanity from itself.	3
5328	A162RUEBFRKZ17	I enjoyed this book.  I really liked the characters and the interactions with each other.  I would recommend this book.	3
5329	ACMXTECRHRJ9F	I've read a lot of mysteries but never one with an archery competition as a backdrop. Looking forward to the next book in the series.	3
5330	A2FI7BGJVW1XEG	first time reader of this author. I love this series. this free one got me hooked now I'm wanting to buy the others in the series. excellent read.	3
5331	A1OSC6POZYEFDV	lots of fun recipes. most have the nutritional information at end of recipe. they also tell you different ways to alternate ingredients.	3
5332	A2PNDHTJVFILN8	Very cute short story and finding the right cowboy for you, while also creating a beautiful program for wild horses.  And taming one of your own.	3
5333	A6E2KGOEZPEBG	Really enjoyed this series. Love all the characters and the women. I really enjoy books with strong female characters and these one has it. The love stories are great too.	3
5334	A375MIKEZZ8KAH	I thought it was a good book to read. It was not a book that I couldn't put down but I still enjoyed reading it.	2
5335	ABQLA46I4KL1B	I enjoyed the suspense of this novel.  Not knowing who to trust, but the chase of the attracted. Good Read.	3
5336	A30GVJS37W5QFQ	This book could have gone on for many more chapters but I'd assume that is why it is a part of a 45 book set.	1
5337	A2PBLD5IF8MWYJ	I would appreciate a continuation of the relationship between the two characters.  For a short, it is well written.  I will be looking for more from this author.	2
5338	A1PZMMLHIUZLGH	Good guys, bad guys, scientists, treasure, thieves and love relationships are all in here. There is nothing really special about this book. It is just a good entertaining read.	3
5339	A2PYPZQY2UENLB	Enjoyed as I do all of her books.Plan to follow her for a while and pick up as each books lets off. Not a great mystery - but enjoyable reading.	3
5340	AC7C2EWX2I9EX	It reads like a 'chapter' in a book.  A short story with a moral at the end.  Each of his 'chapters' were okay.	2
5341	A294DMZSKJF83Q	This is a pleasant short story. The length negates the ability to do any real character development. However it is a pleasant read.	2
5342	AXR9872CRBWBA	Enjoyed reading the story.  Author had you feeling you were along for the trip.  Will look for more books by this author.	3

5344	A3Q68V9VUBO3KU	I Enjoyed the characters. The story dragged in several places. I will read more written by Mr  Walker. I look forward to the next.	2
5345	A19MNJZSO32KD4	It was hot and steamy but had no story line. Along with that it ended badly. It was just one scene of passion.	2
5346	AW1AFYP1RGF4Q	Was interesting and good story, well crafted and kept me reading for most part. Nice light read for cozy evening or while traveling.	2
5347	A2G4DNTPE8N6U2	Oh I can't wait to read more about Gavin.. Hot and sexy ... Can't wait to read the next book in the series ..	3
5348	A3VE7N2XUI8C3K	Enjoyed the characters.  Storyline lacked some depth.  Easy read.  However, it almost lost me several times.  Author does have potential.	3
5349	A1P44JJW47E6QN	Pretty good story line, just seemed to be a lot going on all at once. Hopefully the next book will fill in the story some.	3
5350	A24LRPPZDTDVIX	I am giving season two 4 stars because I felt there were too many unanswered questions.  like season one there were twists and. cliff hangers.  I really enjoyed season two.	3
5351	A3R8BL2YO7DW27	Another good river Jaymes book. Could have easily been longer. I would have enjoyed getting to know them a little better	3
5352	A3CXR577WNWN4R	This was a good historical romance.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend the book to everyone that enjoys a good, wholesome book.	3
5353	ALOMGLBPLJCW1	I didn't read the first book, so I didn't get the full history on the characters.However I still enjoyed this book. Editing was not done properly.	3
5354	AAZRP13OJWEGN	The cadence of the poem is off, but the illustrations are fun and the silly ending is cute -- everyone laughs at underwear, right?	2
5355	AG7U8JD61KXI1	Clever idea and I enjoyed reading it	3
5356	A2O9M056X2BK8T	This was a good book.  I have enjoyed other stories by Donna Mabry  and am sure I will be reading more of her books.	3
5357	AELYPHV5KI2EV	I really do like the characters in this series.  The story line was good also.  I am looking forward to more about all the characters.	3
5358	AKPRB32UZ7EL4	This was a good book. It just goes to show how people can make a bad situation worse by not being honest.	3
5359	A20VK7GSA3F93L	I liked the premise of this book. I just felt that there could have been more development to the story, and to the characters. It was a cute little book.	2
5360	A3VMEXGFYKXYYV	The continuation of great stories that is moving and fast paced. Hard to write the words that can equally describe the story.	3
5361	AYB90RJXY32BI	Masks a little bit too much porn for me. The story and characters were engaging and the story was entertaining	3
5362	AAYK0TLGTAVHZ	Great tips and recipes, I won't be buying as much processed frozen food and a lot of these are kid friendly too	3
5363	A1BG119FYJEVJ7	Bought this book because of Loyalty and Respect was such a good read. Poor story line just bed hopping. Hate I started it.	0
5364	AZC0FAVSW5MPW	I absolutely loved this story. Jane does an amazing job of describing Caro and Sebastians love.  I highly recommend reading this book.  Such an amazing love story.	3
5365	A1JE2MB3OU2XXU	A disappointment...Not enough reading material for the money spent...I like a book to take more than an hour to read	2
5366	A3J3RTN5KYOJVR	I loved Jamie. He was so so sweet.  It would be impossible not to get swept off your feet.  Pretty good plot although I thought it was predictable.	2
5367	A376U5S8TKOE69	Loved the characters but at times the book felt a little long. Can't wait to read Jonathan's and what I assume will be Michael's stories.	3
5368	A1RPAG8DAD21I0	I really enjoyed the continuation of this story. I can't wait for the next one. What is to become of Skylab and the den?	3
5369	A1TNRTUZI9Z55Z	This book provides a lot of unique and interesting health info that i've never heard before, although the suggested treatments seem to be quite effective. Pleased with this.	3
5370	A3ACSKG8ZWZFJ9	If this book was a little longer it would have gotten five stars! Just when it was about to heat up it ended! Good read though	3
5371	A2QZCC9P9712AB	The synopsis made me think this story was going to be way more interesting than it was.  The writing was good but I just wasn't bowled over.	2
5372	A2RRVK52DIFHHP	A Fairly decent read. Not overly enthused about the plot/ story line. I found it to be okay but it could have been better by far.	2
5373	A2CARPQUKH2ZDG	Easy reading in one sitting she was very courageous while living with the Indians. She helped others  and always kept her hope of being rescued	3
5374	A2F43ZCDNT1FYF	I really liked this book.  It was very suspenceful and kept your attention.  I couldn't put it down, I would read it again.	3
5375	A1FVY0MWVO6QQ	Nothing deep here.  Just a quick and entertaining story.  Likeable characters.  It didn't require much thought but was a pleasant ride.	3
5376	A3BC4Y1076DX58	The boss pretty much gets what he wants whenever he wants especially from the Secretary. She seemed to be happy at the end.	1
5377	A36KCHLUNWFG87	wow! she's loving the crew!!	3
5378	A1WY4550YF5AKG	I think kids will love this book and relate to it, because of the beautiful illustration and the catchy story.	3

5382	A2NV8ECUE5QPAW	This is a funny book about a wonderful man who made good use of the English language. Enjoyable light reading.	3

5384	A23B9YR9W29YUQ	This is a fun fast warm read.  The writing is excellent and the characters are so human but they're not. Werewolves witches and vampires oh my what a fine time.ENJOY	3
5385	A1T7080QEOA6E1	Its ok. Lots of sex but not much else really. If you just want something with sex in it then this is good.	1
5386	AIQPBH001CZKH	Being bullied? Who ya going to call? A superhero of course! Everyone around Michael is one, will he be one, too?	2
5387	A2VGPF5UIPD8HD	I couldn't get past the first chapter. I had to put it down when Lady Phoebe believed herself ruined by just a kiss. Please....	0
5388	A39WYE2YM9GPX4	I had a hard time with the last quarter of the book.  I don't want to spoil the ending but I thought it was hard to grasp.	2
5389	A1CG3P40WLD66J	It was a decent book but I didn't see a plot until after half way through the book. Good story but hard to get into.	2
5390	A2RYWJMMS08S29	All I really found in this book was information I could have found by just searching Google for the exact same thing.	1
5391	A3HKUME099K3TN	This was a sweet story where the guy falls in love with the bodyguard. The bad guy could have been better developed, but I did enjoy this author's voice.	3
5392	A3GJIUTHHXQW6T	I couldn't put the book down and it was a very intense and exciting book to read from beginning to end	3
5393	A10H8HRFHGWT4S	Kris trains and is being shaped for the career and life she will lead in the universe.  Not long, but a worthy read.	3
5394	A195CNOUUIT4SU	Someone s fantasy comes to life. But I never understood the whole murder plot. Why would someone want two gorgeous people dead?	3
5395	A2AAW4AX9CIKM1	Good romantic stories.  I loved it.  Keep up the good work.	3
5396	A23W4VL6UFPJ0N	With great details, a lot of emotional information and a large sexual content, this book has a bit of everything.	3
5397	A20UI8P8IQWA4U	this book was ok...I think it contains too many characters to yr and keep up with throughout the book. on to the next book.	2
5398	A2VW1QYZOELXS3	Scott did a good job with this story. I wished it was longer. Now I will have to read some of his other work.	3

5401	A1U8PC13TJPLFT	It was an ok easy reading book, nothing I couldn't put down though and pick up. It was a very short book	2
5402	A1USW03D9ZOR1P	Downloaded this free erotic short. Whoa and Ouch is all I can think to say. If you like spanking...this is a quick read for you.	3
5403	A1ECMAKYZU5B4Z	THis book is predictable, boring and makes me think a monkey locked in a room plucking at the keyboard could be published. Save your $3 and buy a coffee	0
5404	A2VZPR7JT9QHBT	'the storyline was good, thoroughly enjoyed this story. It had a good description of the scenes and I could see the scenes unfolding in my mind.	3
5405	A334AQ7XHTCYLU	yes i will tell a friend about this book.it goes to another book as well.its a good as well.its not what you except it would be	3

5408	A1SCUN1K1TL7PB	I don't cook a lot, but these are like old family recipes.  The stuff my grandmother used to make. So nice to have some of my childhood food to cook!	3
5409	AYCT0K97BZTVZ	It is definitely a cliche story line but the characters individually are enjoyable as well as their interactions. I also enjoyed the change in point of view throughout the story.	3
5410	A2B2JYWXJJFFAL	Another banging book !!!!!!  Cant wait for for the corner 9. Also Mr. Richardson  what's up with jack yancey novel. Haven't heard or seen nothing related to it.  One	3

5412	A2CFX1889NZX62	Can't believe it finished like that. When is the next one due. I hope very soon. This book was way to short for me. I need the rest now :)	3
5413	A2MOW1UC4PPKT6	This is such an easy read and forces Charlotte to see what is right in front of her, just as it has been all along.	3
5414	A2H6SOO305GDGU	This story was just really stupid.  Meet someone and marry a complete stranger within days?  Really??  Glad it was free.	0
5415	A29QM2KSNQ0XQH	A nice story but a little too much religion in it for me...felt it took away from the story. Sometimes a little religion goes over better than preaching does.	2
5416	A2Z1G4L8PEW0AY	Good plot and characters.  Will make you more aware of the real happenings around us pertaining to our environment and negligence.	3
5417	A1SGM2ZQ5LDRMJ	I wasn't crazy about this book. It was supposed to be a time traveling book but was very confusing and hard to follow.	2
5418	A3T2CAX71ZUJZQ	Stringing a bunch of profanity along doesn't make a story or conversation. Very skimpy on substance. This is not a stand alone book.	0
5419	AEG2R7VPVWPVL	This is a great app and I really recommend it to anyone who loves reading news magazines. A paid subscription is required to take full advantage of the app.	3
5420	ARZGNSV1YUN6E	I signed up for a mystery and Im not sure what I got.  There is a strange ring and a death angel and....Not my kind of book.	1
5421	A3VMEXGFYKXYYV	Boring and hard to get into reading	0
5422	A3RENNB7Z03JC1	Not at all what I thought and it was boring. It was not a book for me and I wouldn't recommend it.	0
5423	A1FEBL7652SEPS	Poorly written with Mary Sue characters and way too many unrealistic events shoved into the plot. Don't waste your time.	1
5424	A2N2EVPEKBPWEO	if you are into fatasty, fairies in this world and humans in fairyland, and a bit of fairy war, dont read this this	3
5425	A2530DGAAVNR1O	I enjoyed reading what there was of this book. This seems like the beginning of what could have been a really great book. It just wasn't developed enough.	3
5426	A15F51ZN0AJBSR	This is a fun young love book. Quick to read. I have already put the other two in series on my wish list for future read.	3
5427	A3HEVP1IKH7R7E	This book will be able to help you learn how to paint the interior and exterior of your home. Nice road map for first time house painters.	3
5428	AI4M1RAVSFICL	Formulaic and slow. There are glimmers of hope for more action and character development. set ups for further books are there it would be great to see follow up books.	2
5429	A204WVOVDE013A	Who wouldn't love a cute story involving a kitten and a chunky vet at Christmas? Fun and festive short read anytime of year.	3
5430	A1AV87JMHMQMVN	These recipes remind me of being with my grandmother who are now gone, loved remembering the fun and the talks we had.	3
5431	A1KBO3KCDFGJXJ	This story has the necessary twists and turns to grab my attention, and the characters are complex and very human.	3
5432	A2M64K9DHIC5W6	If you are a fan of J. Frost you will enjoy this quick read.  Bones and Cat are the greatest.  The story line was interesting.  I would suggest it.	3
5433	AGHCHSSFI3YAI	This series is one of my favorites, and this latest entry is not a disappointment. But I really wish the writer would get a proofreader.	3
5434	A31OOST60GJ86X	Ok story line but pretty predictable of it's genre.  This is one of those books that would be a good airplane read, but probably not part of a permanent library.	2
5435	A3DXTTINLXTZTQ	is this the end? could be but the road is paved for other adventures. This book has parts well written and others rushed.But a pleasant reading overall	3
5436	A1Z9H2CBWKOE7M	Needed some editing, but I found it to be a fun read, even though the subject was anything but. A good western.	3
5437	A3NKOJYSJ29DMU	I loved the first book and immediately purchased teh other two, but they were not what I expected them to be. I should have stopped at one.	2
5438	AUEBPIYCCYJ7A	Good story! It was too short though. The chemistry between TJ and Craig was instanteous and you felt it. Looking forward to reading more from this author.	3
5439	A3U6YQF7ZXFJ71	Tea With Emma is filled with charm without being sappy. I was delighted to spend time with these honest characters. I feel as though I know them,flaws and all.	3
5440	ALE1RHSAYMBJK	Great sizzle and tension! I sort of wanted to kick the heroine after she gives it up to Thaddeus a second time, and then questions his intent.......	3
5441	APQ8KAKWAI32Z	This was a Kindle freebie, nice illustrations, quick pace and decent rhyming. My daughter enjoyed scrolling through and looking at the pictures.	2
5442	A1HK0YRN9MB5HE	I'm hooked on Jonas Saul' s writings.  I love the characters in the stories and especially Sarah Roberts. Gotta go and start the next book......	3
5443	A2SUQAW9BOUNCZ	Too predictable, but for the price it is hard to beat. Worth the 15 minutes it takes to read but not much else.	2
5444	A2QKCW4Y1GE3GC	I got about halfway through this book and gave it up.  It just never managed to draw me into the story or interest me in the characters.	2
5445	ANOSVLTGRKABQ	I received this book as a gift. It's a great self help book that helped me find happiness in my life. Thanks dad for the great present!	3
5446	A05796692WLYZFSP0S2DA	It was a good story but to me it was too short but it also had some steamy parts in the story	3
5447	A2V06E99KCLQUO	I enjoyed the book and read it and I would recomjmend it to others for average reading experience DHD DHD	2
5448	A37KS1QWFGHW6A	I enjoyed this novella.  It was funny and had good character development.  I will definitely try the books in this series.	3
5449	A183UVLE6UUXLI	The Montedory Revenge is really about love, touching other subject just to provoke the reader into thinking. Well written and fluent, as expected from short stories. Provokes thinking	3
5450	A2NE245G5EIBXA	This story could have been more developed. I didn't have the urge to continue reading even though I did finish the book.	2
5451	A1W8WFLOBDEB7	Don't bother! It was tragically written, boring and expensive for the couple of pages of reading. Yes I tried to download it for free and even that didn't work.	0
5452	A1C20AB5F1I20O	This is not my usual go to book, a little bit wierd for my taste, but makes you think about what really happens in institional or group homes	2
5453	ANB9GAK0G5P4J	This book hasn't been as predictable as I though. I cant wait to read the  next book of this series. I am looking forward to seeing what will happen next.	3
5454	A4WRE9R70BB5F	Good quick read from front to back. Kind of felt rushed. Would make for a great full length novel with more about there story.	3
5455	A3M1104X8EN9O	I love this series but it is just too short. It keeps leaving me wanting more and more. I hope Blair makes it out o.k	3
5456	A2V3ZGU5MI8AX3	Good story to help kids think about how they can solve problems.  Good helpful questions at the end. Nice illustrations..	3
5457	A2HLVYIVU6VJ3X	I enjoy the journey  with Pamela as she came to terms with her journey and how she wanted to be treated. I recommend reading it.	3
5458	A1BQYUZ59QHHJM	Excellent legal thriller filled with lots of twists and turns making it hard to guess the ending.  Worth every page of reading.	3
5459	ANUI58N680YED	This book has some good recipes to put together quick for days when you are in a hurry.  many of these recipes are nutricious also.l	3
5460	A22GHKAQRWC1WS	This was an okay read.  Sometimes we just need something a little less serious.  Try it for a light mystery.	2
5461	AE5IA4M4NQLY	A sweet, good feel, short story. Loved all the characters, just wished the story were longer. I love this author.	3
5462	ASMX4BTRBDWXL	I like erotica but this was just trash.  Nasty trash.  I couldn't even finish the whole short-story because it was so lame.  I wish I could give it no stars.	0
5463	A2WTXPK937T2TT	Mistletoe Mischief was a nice little book to get you into the Christmas Spirit. I didn't think it would make it, but it did.	2
5464	A26GE9ZG68SKIQ	this was a murder mystery and had so many people being kidnapped that you wonder who was next.the good people worked the bad people.	3
5465	A3RWU4TFPXS4YU	This book was interesting but not enough character development for me.  The plot moved rapidly and held my attention.  I probably wouldn't recommend it to a thriller/mystery reader.	2
5466	A32017LB1QI2CB	A riveting fast paced fictional novel that keeps you engaged throughout the book. A well written as well as entertaining.	3
5467	AXDW7WIXEPAKN	This book was okay. It seemed lacking creativity. It was basic in detail and story line.I have read much better books about the Amish.	0
5468	AUX6WT9UI51NR	I like this short story, but wish it had more to it. It is a typical Baldacci novel always the best work	3
5469	A7DOO7L5NOOTT	Nice Christmas romance with a little mistletoe magic thrown in. There were a few things that made me laugh. Fun read.	3
5470	AF3PND66F13AY	i chose this rating because I like books with more action and this book was written in a language and vernacular that was hard to stay entertained	2
5471	A238E46FZ6PYVB	Nice story but so old fashioned in the writing.  No one talks like this anymore.  Good for the grandparent reader perhaps.	2
5472	AUQZVQW6MKFHZ	Too slow, read 25%, but gave up.  Also didn't like the Snoop-Dog lingo inserted here and there.  Not big on rappers in general.	1
5473	AMAVWR7GSC8KZ	It was good. Typical romance but the language threw me offer at times. You already saw what was coming by the middle of the book. No surprise.	2
5474	ABPMTLUH054C7	Well thought-out with interesting characters that you got to care about.  Lots of nice twists and unexpected turns.  A really good read!	3
5475	A2W4O9AZEZONKX	Had to return for refund. I can't say anymore of this book or writer. Just wouldn't spend money on it.	0
5476	A2YCTKN86EHQDV	This book was ok it dealt with an almost rape and new feeling and moving to another state were you can find love	3
5477	A2Y8AO68L3431A	The story is ok. I like westerns. Just a little to slow for me. But you may find it to your liking. Have at it!	2
5478	A2JVRBQXX14OJ6	Great fast read.  I wish the ending was a bit more detailed but overall it was a grest story.  A thug in crisis is a thug in need lol.	3
5479	A1QK6MRX0O3M4L	I enjoyed reading it. In fact I bought part two and will read the third book in the series when it comes out.	3
5480	A1RX4C5KOU5Z26	85 percent of book 1 repeated all of what we have already read. Made no sense. Hopefully 2 will get to it without repeating all the other stuff.	0
5481	A2A5S179ZPW207	I cannot believe this book actually made it into print!  It was all nonsense.  I would not recommend it to anyone.	0
5482	A265D4GL9W950S	This book while interesting was way too short it just gives you a very small taste of the life of the Nameless one.	2
5483	A2F8IF0C0KKSIV	This is my first time reading from this author. I liked the story and the main characters. Will read more.	3
5484	A3SX3C1VHOBD1I	I really enjoyed this book, it makes you feel like it is never too late and you can do whatever you set you mind to do!	3
5485	A1SFYDUWYRAHH0	Great characters and the plot was wonderful. Good suspense and exciting drama. Will read more by this author.  Love the series will look for more.	3
5486	A10S049RIL1LY0	Just an okay book. It is a good idea but this book doesn't give many answers about the subject. They had good intentions.	2
5487	A1ZEZVS257DP5I	A simple story with a lesson learned, perhaps just until the next time little duck becomes curious. A nice read for a young child, with cute illustrations.	3
5488	A1H1UEDPDQWOBS	There were a lot of good ideas in this book, but some seem to be a bit of a stretch.	3
5489	A2D3IZIQQCT4QE	Wonderful recipes for all kinds of treats that we should probably not eat if we want to stay slim. That's all I'm saying. (smile)	3
5490	A2CCO4HWIFOP5J	Another Van Holt winner. Good story, fine adventure and action tale. Certainly not Louis Lamour, but a quick fun read for a rainy afternoon. I liked it.	3
5491	A130TZ1CHF1HWT	It was OK for just a short story.  I wish it had more of a plot.  I am glad I got a free copy.	1
5492	A1ADQQ0YL3TU6W	so poorly written...such an unlikely scenario....this was just another one of those poorly thought out survivor scenarios....I did not finiish this book.	0
5493	A26U0LCPJ2GVR9	All were good short stories.  I think Frost should do more werewolf stuff.  I lovedall three stories.	3
5494	A76R91C12SABM	I enjoy this love story very much I am glad that Summer found love I hope I find money to read more	3
5495	A34O9A5BTZN1I	Ok good but no sex at all! Definitely not a romance book. Would of liked to have seen some romance.	1

5499	AE38OB95FG6GZ	A great book, kept me not wanting to put it down to find out what was going to happen next.	3
5500	AUK9DWLDGXBNZ	The book was slow and not as interesting as others I have read will stick to the authors I have enjoyed reading	2
5501	A3MRJS8SXE3CMK	This series was written for a much younger audience. PJ's emotions are so bipolar.The memories/visions rewritten in italics were too much and did not add to the story line.	2
5502	A1B3XAD24PWRAP	Love this series	3
5503	A29G3T6ZZY26TL	Gives the basic ideas behind smoothies and the benefits to them and then follows up with recipes. All not too exciting but a good starting place.	2

5505	A2EFMLM83QH4GI	Very realistic portrayal of women's dynamic relationships with each other and their extended families. It made me want to read more from this author.	3

5508	A1JF6J4BWXSFLP	The storyline was good but it was missing something. It left me feeling incomplete. The date at the doctor's office was confusing.	2
5509	A1C09AU5GF0MRP	"An ok read, however the characters lacked ""teeth"". The story seemed to ramble and no conclusion was reached. Reminiscent of  Lord of the Flies."	2
5510	A3GVWI36KNXTVO	I found this book very confusing and hard to follow. Tried 3 times to read it and each time had to force myself to go back to it.	0
5511	A2WGAP9KQ2EFB6	Love, history and a little mystery makes this a wonderful read. Find a cosy spot and lose yourself in this feel good story.	3
5512	A29JTK4301DT55	Can't wait for the rest of their story!  Loved that she stopped and is making him want more and how he stood up for her	3
5513	AXAGJCUY2TEJ4	I enjoyed it as an adult even though it for a younger crowd.A quick enjoyable read,a shifter book with a twist,lots of fun with a message about bullying.	3
5514	A1SEVKS675Q6MK	At least there are no terrible things going on. Sometimes I have to wonder why these guys bother with women who don't seem to want them... Cute premise.	3
5515	A1YAW3RF0YOLBZ	It was okay I guess I think you can write books and have a lot of concern for people too but I prefer comics	3
5516	A1KGZCNZJVL7RY	I like the series. They are short read which is nice when you are short on time. I enjoy the storyline and can't wait to see what happens	3
5517	AFMMHENVC60TQ	Intriguing book and storyline.  Story was intense and loved the chemistry between Nick and Sienna. You have one hot alpha and a damsel in distress.	3
5518	A3FTF0OMIHM42H	Nicely sets up the Cindy Eller series which is a frankly fun series about a baking witch and her roomies.	3
5519	AJAR1GIOL94TR	I enjoyed the book.  I like Helen Conrad's books.  Could do with a little less skin and language but the stories are good.	2
5520	A21ZIRZCCIYJBG	This book was just OK. I've read better. It didn't really give a chance to learn about the characters. It seemed rushed in some areas and dragged along in others.	2
5521	A1SWZFK6ROLY5D	It was an interesting story about love, betrayal, courage, forgiveness, and coming of age for a young werelion woman living among werewolves. I enjoyed this story.	3
5522	A5NZUR5JV9MQB	This story, though flirting with a really good fantasy, fails to deliver fully because there is a lack of realism about it.	2
5523	A3PHC2I8BRO40C	Cute story line. Great summer beach reading. I could put this down and pick it up easily where I left off.	3
5524	A3AR1CXQN87B4P	ALL GOOD STORIES AND KEPT ME READING AND WANTING MORE	3
5525	A3MPFSXHOBCEWC	Landry is one naughty girl. Not bad, a quick and dirty one. Thirty minutes tops. And pretty sexy to boot. One worth checking out! Why not?	2
5526	A3J0I4D59IMZND	I really enjoyed this book. I would suggest others to read it and try the series. Brett Battles is good.	3
5527	ADXRJFXVGGEFE	I enjoyed this book, one scene was a little bit of a turn off for me , but good story.	2
5528	A19M9NKK0VTG2I	I found this book entertaining, even suspenseful at times. A lot of the plot was highly improbable, but with all said, a fun read.	2
5529	A2BJ8I16EBFRET	Sorry but it's boring. If this is what gets you off then...well I can't help you. But I've had better on the Hallmark channel and that's saying something.	1
5530	AVTOKS08HOEXG	This curious little story, although bizarre, certainly made me smile.  Well written and humorous, it was a great short read!	3
5531	A3OOE22FWMSO3G	Good story too short though but very straight to the point great sexual encounters, I will look for more books by this author	2

5535	A1MXSVPHCTNPRT	Some neat recipes in here.	2
5536	A2FI7BGJVW1XEG	very good read from start to finish. can't wait to buy the next books. looking forward to finding out all of the characters get into.	3

5539	A3ALMNUTJS22FZ	Ok really hot stranger sex! i'm curious about the next ones but i'm not paying $3 for 35 pages. This one was free.  :-)	3

5543	A10K9L57CXAQG5	This series was a quick reading, clean romance that made your feelings tingle with anticipation.  Each story touches the heart without becoming vulgar.	2
5544	AFM4SXJFXYH4M	Being hooked on Silo stories, of course, I loved this.  Weirdly engaging.  Not a typical Silo view but fits as if written by HH.	3
5545	A1ZKVP1UYZEJAY	The short story &#8220;Unexpected Endings&#8221; was a cute story filled with a gamut of emotions, but would have been better incorporated with the previous story.	3
5546	ANWOCURFI1MMW	Jeremy and Malanie fell in love as teenagers, and were separated by lies and misunderstandings.  They get their second chance ten years later to get it right.	3
5547	A3CL6XU8SJE6CK	Though this story was at times predictable, it was a good character-driven story of high school seniors trying to figure their lives and sexuality out.  A good, recommended book	3
5548	ALMLQQCRYUCCV	Nice story line, ok plot, just not my cup of tea.I read the whole book but would not read it again.	2
5549	A38K5A38JROTJD	THIS BOOK WAS A GOOD READ.A PAGE AFTER PAGE TURNER DETAILED AND AMAZING BEBO BOOKS READ LIKE MINI MOVIES KUDOS BEBO ON ANOTHER HOT READ.NICKI WILLIAMSSOUTH SIDE DIVA	3
5550	A23865UCM7KTFO	Sadly its short length didn't allow for character and plot development .... It was an enjoyable read ... But not a high recommend!  Could have and should have been longer.	2
5551	A12PAD91Z8VU7D	Waste of time and money. Just a bunch of nonsense. Very underdeveloped storyline and unlikable characters with a dumb story the one person interesting in the story never ges developed	0
5552	AFQI4YZ3VU4Z5	These books are very good and keep you wanting to read them but I think $2.99 is to expensive for such a small book.	3
5553	A1R642XKR910W3	Interesting story, holds you attention, characters are reasonably accurate.  Especially liked the retired detective and his angst over retirement.  Surprise ending.	2

5557	A38PUVPQDTNG1B	This is a quick read.  The stories are good altho a bit tireing of all the romance.  Xlent value and worth the money.	3

5559	AHF5R86S1Y6YK	Girls Night Out: Volume 2 is an awesome collection of sexy stories by four skillful authors.  The stories were steamy, sensual and... oh so HOT!  A sexy read! Need more!!!	3
5560	A19F9NSDKP2ZM3	Good Book.  It ended strange and have to get next book to see what happened. I will follow this one.	3
5561	A2D3A5RE16Q2UW	Could not get into the story from the very first  page. Too much useless info and not enough captivating info.	0
5562	A4PBAD6FKTHR0	Pretty good read, considering the misspelled words and the wrong names of certain person. His when it should have hers. Otherwise I enjoyed this novel.	2
5563	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	This has to be one of the best free books I have ever read.	3

5571	A2W7WWXZE02KGD	Really like this series, and was excited about this update but only 4 stars because I HATE cliffhangers. Now I can't wait till the next installment.	3
5572	A33OM5IX0UBUS7	It was a fun book, I bought it because of Jill Shalvis and the Lucky Harbor story, but the other 2 stories were a good addition to it.	3
5573	ATMJ50U4LW6NI	Really enjoyed this book. Loved the sexy little twist in the story line.Recommended as a fun read with some mystery!	3
5574	A3T2C5APQXK4TP	Light, frothy novel that is more romance than science fiction.  Worth reading if you need distraction but you probably won't read it again	2
5575	A2IB8VMEW5ANS0	I thought I was going to read a novel about Craw but this is a book of poetry.  Nice Poetry.	1
5576	A1P1XVZ3T92HMC	Meh..not worth the time. I am sorry. I hate to be this way. I expect more from a book. Sorry..	1

5579	A2INLBFV40W1R3	I like the short novellas, makes it easier to read the book, for me personally. . Jennifer is a by old writer, I'd like to see what else she does	3
5580	A37M97TBODVIQ8	Story written by what appeared to be a tween.  Never got past page 4 before dumping it from my Kindle	0
5581	A3TBZ8AHNNSXKL	I would have liked a little bit more info on the  characters. But otherwise very creative. I recommend it for people who love vampires.	3
5582	A278XUR7TMZ3PD	What happens when two emotionally insecure people collide... Figuratively and LITERALLY!  I loved every minute go Matt and Lucy's story.	3
5583	A2XKX5TBB6WV00	I enjoyed this story.  It was short, but it was to the point and I enjoyed how Addy overlooked Roan's scars.	3
5584	A1K54YPTK1LJ0U	I love the idea of this book, but it just never came together .  Lot's of drama and bed jumping, a little too much for me..	2
5585	A36MPL77DKTF2C	It was truly fascinating. I loved reading about Superman and the battle scene was truly spectacular. I absolutely loved reading about Superman and his adventures	3
5586	A35LBI5EE15ETV	I did not buy into the plot.  The story was well written and the author will have alot to offer in the future.  Believeablity was lacking	2
5587	AVO7BODO8D51G	Nice illustrations and interesting action but the inclusion of word I would not want my grandson to use ruined the story.  I would not read it to or with him.	0
5588	AK584OM1U2OLD	In so upset that I spent $3.99 for a book that ended near 75%. It's too expensive for such a short story.	1
5589	A1HLSH6U9OL29L	While the sex showed up a little to early I thought, the story was unique.  I will never look at a corn maze the same way again.	3
5590	A2ZXUMRVVIF5V6	This seemed like a new writer, an uncomplicated formula story with shallow relationship development but with attempts at individual introspection. A quick read.	2
5591	A223T998MPEEWS	A very good book kept your interest through out the whole book you wanted to find out if they ended up being together	3
5592	AMI70E6VFBQ5C	Truly easy breezy reading. Enough of a plot and character development to intrigue and entertain. Enjoyable and relaxing with just enough suspense.	3
5593	A3IFXNFSG9SSMJ	It's an interesting introduction to whatever comes next.  Not too much going on here.  Anticipation is somewhat stirred.  Looking forward to the next book.	2
5594	A3KP96V05DZO3A	Although they are short reads, it is intense and keeps u reading to see what happens. Anxious for the next.	3
5595	A24UIKJZUGEONB	This was a nice story.  I liked both characters.  I will definitely check out other stories by this author.  Priced appropriately.	3
5596	A3FZ5R9XQC9JIV	I didn't read the first book, and I had no problem following or getting into this book. It had a lot of good characters and I really liked it.	3
5597	A3I79MJBM2UVGB	Reads like the beginning of a story I need to continue. The pure and innocent beginning of a life when you go from child to adult	3
5598	A60GNCULAIKD9	This book is just an ad to self publish your book on Smashwords. Do not expect practical advice for marketing.	0
5599	A2C7P50ZN44S70	It's okay. Not sure if I would read another part. It was just okay to me. Nothing really stood out to me. But, it's an okay read if your bored	2
5600	A2ME9GVNNFX5HY	I found the jumping back and forth between years hard to follow and when the storyline finally moves forward - that's the end.	2
5601	A2PG3TR4BRSD10	Don't let the &#34;young adult&#34; rating fool you, these are a nice light read for anyone who likes a little fantasy - witches; fairies; angels and lots of great magic!	3
5602	A2DNTX6VOZFUSV	There was no background story and we just jump to the sex. If that's what you're looking for then it's a quick read	1
5603	A3LKA6SYHP7BUE	It was a decent book, I liked the plot but at times the story felt like it was either dragging on or racing full speed ahead.	2
5604	A3NR5SQ57NJ5DJ	A little shorter than I expected. But still good. On to #2. Can't wait to see what happens in Paris.	1
5605	A3CPOHWLDXQZ6E	Lots of good information, not sure how much is backed by science, however. I take curmumin in capsule form and liked this resource.	3
5606	A597K8L3W976T	I read the first two books in this series, but it gets old really fast.  Excessive repetitive, overly politicized and thin characterization abound.	2
5607	A10CTHRWD9P9IB	It's a fine case, but too small for my Droid 4, I have a hard case as well and it doesn't fit, wish I hadn't bought 3.....	2
5608	A22MI5I3S9UQ1Y	Oh my what a very good book this was can't wait to read more from this amazing author who keeps you interested till the end of the book.	3
5609	A31KCODU53XD2V	I got thru it, but it was not one of my favorites.  Not much into the vampire thing, but it was okay.	2
5610	A5I8B43YGGKN	I enjoyed reading all of the short stories. I love me a mystery and add a little humor...you can't go wrong!	3
5611	AUHAHMVQ49FM	I just could not get into this book.I all ways read a book when I start it This one I could not.	0
5612	A1DC00T32U26HC	Good variety of characters.  Fun to read.  Kept me interested. Look  forward to next book.  Easy to follow the plot.	3
5613	A33XBOE8AUOT1	Sweet addition to &#34;Escorted.&#34;  I thought the story felt a little rushed, but I will continue to read Claire Kent because of her wonderful characters!	3
5614	A38ISDTH0LVKC6	Light, refreshing, traditional--probably all these words could describe both the tea in this book as well as the story line.  Easy and fun	3
5615	ACM9D68YC2QO7	Could not get into this book, If a book doesn't catch me in the first few pages I put it aside and go to a different book.	0
5616	A3BZF6QGCGU5AM	I liked it, it was a very classic regency romance. One in which two of societies outcasts find love and happiness together.	3
5617	A2U8YWPP1PYHJM	Some journeys ate harder than others.  The Journey of self discovery can be the most difficult.Fast packed action adventure.	3
5618	A3P4KX0M5ONW56	It was ok for a lazy read..... could have spent the time doing something else.... the religious aspect was rather weak..... The science was ok and made sense.... .....	2
5619	A2HAJ25XOX0C94	Children of the After: EVOLUTION (Book 3) I only read the third book because I wanted to know where the children ended up.	2
5620	A2C7CA9AKTFTFI	This book is good. It's a book that you can't put down I read it in one day. Very good book differently a book to recommend.	3
5621	AKC9L6H14O15U	It was a good book. I didn't like the ending I feel the author could have made the ending more private for the characters.	3
5622	AKH906R0Z1PPS	Interesting book. Good read, a ok story. The characters were likeable. Marco was over possessive, a complete alpha dominant male. Natalie was your sweet girl next door.	2
5623	A1YHQ4SP88MW9C	This book  is not interesting enough.  The pictures were good, but I wish it could have held my grand daughters interest	2
5624	A1CFCHKK16UBYI	Just like i said it was okay and entertaining to read it at least so popular papa Philip die da	1
5625	A30ZNYT3UVTG2Q	Was not what I expected. Found it gory and blood-even for me an ER nurse of 40 years. Not what I needed after a long day at work.	1
5626	AY8KFCSYHPYWZ	This is a beautiful and yet well written story. I hope to see more of them.  Well written and highly recommended	3
5627	A2UBITXPCPHXAO	Too short to be called a book, didn't measure up to her other books.  I was disappointed.  I read it from beginning to end in a couple of hours.	1
5628	A12Z0IYZWWKCS5	a bunch of folks and their status' without a thread to pull them together.  this isn't a book let alone a story	0

5630	AAWYVRAMKVFZR	I already know all this stuff. I did not like how it only told you stuff that you already should know.):	2
5631	AU9ZIJ2BIXNY2	This book was definitely different from most other mysteries I have read. Definitely kept me interested at times, at others got a little slow.	2
5632	A2PH7MWAJD2GHD	This book was an easy  read it kept you interested through out the entire book. You can read it in a day.	2
5633	AMD94KRA2PQC2	I liked the sense of humor that Zara and Deanna have. I think that and Hot men were what saved this book.	1
5634	A1GS1EX68K53ZS	It was interesting. A well read to keep me interested in looking at book two. Who know  a kidnapping would aid up like that.	2
5635	A24W33F614DUPM	Very well written book - entertaining as well - lots of good twists and turns - i hope to see more by this author	3
5636	A1NICK0RUQYWZ7	Cute, fast read. Enjoyed it except for a couple of wrong word usages. That's a pet peeve of mine and I found two in this short story.	2

5638	A2HDS4FKXWAZB8	Edgy series with memorable characters. I found myself unwilling to put this down and always enjoy Ms. Hart's work.	3
5639	A8LNWFGHWEEO3	A good book to jump start you using your kindle fire or kindle fire hd. Also short and to the point.	3
5640	A3RC9RHMXKWTRR	Quick prequel read to a pretty good series. You fall in love with the characters and their quirks. Worth reading.	2
5641	A3SWSIW6QT5HFJ	Loved the characters. Not sure I liked the way it jumped around. What happened to Grace? Thanksgiving was just skipped over? Ended poorly.	3
5642	A2KTNKLHGEHSX2	I enjoyed the different point of view, from a dog!  Cute short mystery.  I will read some more adventures in the Iggy Chronicles.	2
5643	A2LQJIM2H35MHR	It was interesting to see what happens in the police dept.What happens when you deal with the scum of the worldOn a daily bases.	3
5644	A1CG7A1KBWAR4H	I was very pleased with this- the characters were meshed beautifully. I also liked that characters from the previous two books were included as well, and had not altered any.	3
5645	A2VZPR7JT9QHBT	A good story set in the American west with a feisty heroine and her cowboy lover,  Good storyline and good description of the West in mid 19th century.	3
5646	A2LODWOZZ3LATQ	I love Julia and Sebastian  These characters seemed more real than any of the others. I can't wait to keep reading More	3

5648	A2MNJQMGB1SCFG	Very similar to panic although I did not like this one as well.  The storyline was not as good but it was well written and easy reading.	3
5649	A1MJ6EKMXQAN8	This little book is worth your time to read if you want to understand the basics of important nutrients.Not too much info here, but the important stuff!	3
5650	A27ZJ12FPGR21V	A taste of boredom. This book is a lead in to other books. There was absolutely nothing that would read any more of this drivel. Sorry Sky Corgan.	0
5651	A22YQR21F2EWW9	This was an interesting book that has used concerns about cruise lines in a realistic storyline. It also demonstrated the heartbreak families go through when another family member is missing.	3
5652	AOUPEIOL1VGWP	I purchased this box set because I read the first as a free book and enjoyed it.  They were enjoyable, light reads.	2
5653	A2QGPLGYWNTU1X	This was a terrific little story about they elf Aidan and the witch in training Marion. Loved the storyline and the other characters also. A great little read and recommended.	3

5655	AM31XSSJ6ZLEC	Free book thru Book Bub. Too many characters; difficult to keep up with between the cats and the Marilyn Monroe look-alikes, and random family members.	1
5656	A3PDCUDIVGUS7X	We really enjoy Asian food so I found this book good and with several recipes I would like to try.	3
5657	A26F7NI9B6CP62	Another enjoyable read.  Atmospheric and likable characters.  This, like &#34;Far Horizons&#34;, had a large number of grammatical errors and should have been edited more carefully.	2
5658	A192UEIQ5OM6E9	This book was as good as the first one. I can't wait to start book 3. This is an awesome series.	3
5659	AF4ZJW6DVI18T	I don't normally rank cook books or ingredient books - because I never read anything except exactly what I looked up.  This was a good reference though.	1
5660	AYDD1AT2ZES29	This was entertaining for a few hours.  One of a series.  I will NOT read the others.  Predictable plot, smattering of sex, &#34;happy&#34; ending, etc., etc.,	2
5661	A33VBRQ3WDUDJD	This was good story and hate the cliffhangers!! It will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what is coming next.	3
5662	A1B5Q6MP6EW4D2	Full of action. Sex, money, power , betrayal and down right scandolous family secret makes this a page turner. Cant wait for part 2.	3
5663	A14V90HRZPE58E	Very interesting read.  I enjoyed reading this book.  Good suspense and a fast moving story line.  Easy to read as well.	3

5667	AJ7XR494MS48P	I would have liked a better plot for this short.....it seemed totally predictable.  Maybe would have been better as a longer read to give more character development.	2
5668	A3OCKJ3WL1IVRI	It was a good read a bit too fast paste but am still looking forward to part 2' .hope it's not gonna be a long wait	2

5674	A3HCJGBG9C7NX7	I loved this book and finished it in two sittings. It was well-written and fast-paced. I will definitely read more.	3
5675	A1PWO47Z7J1O9O	Quick read, but very sweet. Characters drew you into the story and led you to a very satisfying conclusion. Definitely recommend.	3
5676	A23MMF3NZPU8WF	My first read by this author. It wasn't bad. It was funny, sexy, and romantic. I'd read more of her books.	2
5677	A1XZDHR1QQL3MN	A good story filled with the usual twist and turns and good plot that Lee Child always has in his novels.	3
5678	A1LMGLR8G3T4KL	If it's the first book you've ever read then it may be of benefit. However, if you've done any research then this is a rehash of old news.	2
5679	APHRI6QXZ9Y0P	Kinda dumb. But if you want to try that is up to you. I just would not if i were you	0
5680	A3XS9953K2YO8	This book was ok a little YA For me.  What is up with the pretty girl so much. Started to make him sound like a bird.	2
5681	A1GP7RVHHI5GOP	This book was very good. However it was also very sad. I really enjoyed this whole series. I would enjoy more books.	3
5682	A2FTU5RCIXBIZG	The heroine was a stuck up bitch, but the plot was amazing. Men with babies are just so darn cute.	3
5683	A24GJ7V2M5INXD	This is a good read with some twisted that I didn't see coming, with characters that draw you in and make you care about them.	3
5684	A1A0OBUWMLUKNG	I didn't like how abruptly it ends.  I was really into the story, then it was over.  Otherwise a great read.	3
5685	A1ZJWV48LW7GV3	A little bit of dominance and a little bit of sex.  A very quick read (15-20 minutes).  Hey - but what do you expect for free?	2
5686	AZQSQSF2QI02F	This first part had me confused along th  way and now I have to read part two just to straighten out what happened already.	2
5687	A2RFID3EKKBWK5	I can't say I believed all the little coincidences and reversals here, but they didn't stop my enjoyment of the story.	3
5688	A58E0YBAX9QG6	I'm glad they wrapped up the whole series, but I just wished this book had been a longer read. Seemed really short and rushed.	3
5689	ABPIYEB1GFK1C	I enjoyed the book.  Editing is much better than previous books and I look forward to future installments to come.	3
5690	A13C53Z3ONTAIS	There are 3 books in this series and it is best to read them in the correct order so that the characters make sense.  Good to read.	3
5691	A2AZ79TSJHJK01	This was a wonderful book... Going to Vegas while not remembering && getting married!  Great story!  The old father/ father-in-law at the end doing &#34;the right thing&#34; that was wonderful!	3
5692	A29QM609YT8GUZ	hard to get into but the more you read it the more it made sense, like a viruses point of view	2
5693	A2YKD6KVVYIKT0	Leave this to those who don't want to read a good book. I just didn't enjoy this one from the very first page.	0
5694	A32NEX2VLAZF30	I did like the book, but most of it was boring to me.  I do however, like this type of story.	2

5698	A2HBMN6Y5N41QW	this book was distressing.  gross painted a vivid picture of childhood abuse. I could not recommend this book as a wholesome read.	2
5699	A197W8MNF706HT	This was a good story although, I figured out who did it very early on. Very hot virgin sex and bonding scene. I will continue to read on.	3

5701	A14KSCRYKZLMSF	I like most vampire books. So this was another good series I got into. Downloaded it on my kindle fire and enjoyed it.	3
5702	A3P1KL52TDHC9J	This book could have been more interesting. The characters were hot enough that this could have been twice over more erotic and spine tingling.	0
5703	AHTX4TWG3AMZA	if you need a book to research poe's work here's the book.  every one of his works are listed in here.  as for stories..nooo	0
5704	ARNF0LG0K2QAJ	It was a short love story and I didn't finish it, so that pretty much sums it up for me. Love stories are just not my thing.	1
5705	A2076BGSWD0A7K	I so enjoy the 2 main characters! The bad guys get what they deserve. I love the witty conversations between the characters.	3
5706	ANV7YXXVCO2GB	I would definitely recommend reading this book before you read the Underlife. It gives you a lot of background information.	3

5709	A1SB7E2DLBODIQ	Don't purchase this it is not a full story,it is only one chapter. You have to pay .99 cents for the next chapter.	0
5710	A2MUGF5KD2L2B7	I liked this book. It was the first Zane Grey book I ever read. It was a real cowboy read, alot of  cowboy language. It's worth the read.	3
5711	A1H0J4Y7FIPL7N	Looking for a good read with a lot of action, well you have found it Irresistible Woman. A story about three friends.	3

5714	A3CVM1FPBIFZ6F	I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I couldn't wait to purchase and devoured it within a few hours.  It was too short for my taste though.	3
5715	A3G8GALHEO23WF	You should check that your clothes, makeup, and hair aren't outdated. Take care of your skin, drink water, get sleep. Well, duh. No major new secrets revealed here.	2
5716	A32YBELCSU4TB2	It is a short story with a heroine who knows what she wants and seized the moment when she met her Viking.	3

5719	A3W1TOZKASFQB1	It was ok, a bit short but ok. I don't think I will be purchasing the next book only if it's free, just to see if Anthony brother finds love.	1
5720	A348GYLVPWT8AK	I like the stories that these authors write but this was short and sweet. I am hoping to read more of their work.	3
5721	AD6GW701UZ8VL	There is quite a variety in these stories.  I must say that I enjoyed &#34;The Seven Folds of Winter&#34; and wish it had a sequel.	3
5722	A3ONFK1Q3SKWTP	I believe this book is pretty good I enjoyed it pretty much but there wasn't too much excitement but it was somewhat romantical. I recommend it for a short read	3
5723	A2Y2D7PBEU3HFZ	I thought this was a good read. I have read part one and part two. They really draw you into the story.	3
5724	A2LFPPFOQIF5RS	It was a easy storyline to follow. Any newbie ballerina or any little girl will like this book. Now as far as getting a special bow might be a problem.	3

5727	AH6299BQN7YAQ	This book was a break from all the urban novels I've been reading lately. I recommend this book to anybody needing a break from the normal urban novels. Refreshing.	3
5728	A1CWMO3LQQ7P0P	Was worth every dollar that was spent... Nothing but generalities and blah blah. Don't waste your time, just Google it.	0
5729	A34EGIW65FYNMD	It was a good story but I did not hold my interest as much as some other books. It is not one that I want to read again.	3
5730	A3H10TBPGHYSII	This is a further insight about life in the Victorian era.  I read it after reading Life as a Victorian Lady, and it too shed light on this era.	3
5731	A1Y8CIHAVRL7V0	Horrible plot. Horrible unlikable characters.  Badly in need of an editor.  Very disappointed in this book. Glad it was free.	0
5732	A2Z8A1W957DXRU	This story was not worth the time it took to download it. I was looking for a quick, fun read. Although quick, it was just dumb.	1
5733	A5C5Z8CTXX309	Funny book with nice pics. Also pretty interesting facts about Halloween. Nice book to get some ideas for preparing the party.	3
5734	A1U07SY65BIA16	I did enjoy this. Easy to read and the pace was good.  Sometimes you just need something fun to read. Thsi worked.	3
5735	A08781071G0NWPF7DQOVR	Over all this was a great series to read. Loved from afar until he got his chance. Something different for a change.	3
5736	A3CU5LZJ29UAR3	Kate Grey did a good job for this short story. It was funny, downright sexy, inventive and easy to read and follow the characters. More, more, more!	3
5737	AD8SD3H0MERBJ	pure fiction but, for the most part, believable. I would've liked to known what engineering feat was performed to get the more out of the canyon.	3
5738	A2F1VSYZM3WVI1	I enjoyed part 2 as much as I enjoyed the first one. Can't wait for the 3rd one in the series. Keep them coming!	3
5739	A28SW1AQI0RADX	Different hot and intense. It's a good second book in the series.  Love the boys. The action was a bit thin. But all over a good read.	2
5740	A2FUX7VDGRKXZG	It may be acceptable to an anglophile.  Does not successfully portray English humour.  Too tedious to persevere to the end.	1
5741	ACCQOBC1A7IDJ	If you're looking to improve your success and happiness in life, then I recommend this book and the tools it offers within.	3
5742	A3AA5QWK2U3FIK	too much emphasis on the protagonist's smoking cigarettes.that, alone, seemed to be used again and again as a filler. mystery plot was good, but too much inner thinking.	2
5743	A37X0XHWO2ILDM	The premise is odd to begin with.  However it works once you get past the strangeness.  It's an easy read.	2
5744	A6AJU4FHY1H81	This is a sort of classic style Sci Fi. Think Harry Harrison. The story is cute and entertaining. A good little read and a fun Sci Fi universe.	3
5745	A2P9C21LMWZKS6	the story was compelling but the many editing flaws were distracting and the motives and logic of the story was sometimes weak.	2
5746	A3SE0VJ4627MHS	To follow this adventure was a little difficult.  The wording was very instructive as to the situation.  You had to have your thinking cap on with this book. Thanks	2
5747	A1CYCHQ9DA7KC8	Not my thing, just wanted to complete the story...again my fault for not reading it thoroughly, just not for me...	0
5748	A125AUW6J0LGR8	This was a good read. Ophelia and Z story is how two people with broken hearts, can over come there fears and learn to love again.	3

5750	A1EWZUV76DSB9L	I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next one.  Thanks Amazon for making it available.  Good work.	3
5751	A2TCSSXBEZ9EY6	But the book was well-written and thoughtfully organized.  I liked that the author included ideas for repurposing items to be incorporated in one's sale.	2
5752	A32AEAEL73GM54	Liked the book Alissa was very ungrateful wish she could have been nicer to teegan and quin wanted a better epilogue into all the characters future	3

5758	A2DWBCW3PCK3G6	An enjoyable quick read that reminds you tat honestly and secrets can cause more harm than good. Nice easy read.	2
5759	A3BY4QSC446SDV	A lot of the short stories in this book were really good and some totally fell flat. I gave four stars for the great one's. It's worth a read.	3
5760	A1VA2I63CK09BU	I enjoyed this book. Would have loved for it to have been longer. The characters appealed and the story flowed well. I'll be reading more from this author.	3
5761	AUC9K27AMSMGO	Good read but twisting. It has thriller, mystery horror and suspense but had to re read to follow at times	3
5762	AKVWMLFXHB6X7	The only thing it needed is a place for my stylus pen.  Otherwise I had no problems with the case.	3
5763	AHF5R86S1Y6YK	Awesome story by author Braxton Cole.  The sex scenes were not only hot, but explosive!  This book is a must read!!!	3
5764	A1GTCMUZEUGP6P	Three stars..kinds like the rich millionaire theme but very pushy man.  I also struggle with some cliff hangs.  This was a good read..but a lot like fifty shade	2
5765	A2XZG7NZXGWNB4	The book was good but it was too many characters that I had to focus on....overall the book was good and I am patiently waiting for the second book	3
5766	A1RQ8MVLVZE9H5	I was hoping this book would have a better ending t it ended up being a tale of death love and misery.	2
5767	APRBL5ZMRUGKL	It was ok but not like the other books that I have reading. Wait and see part two what happened	1
5768	ADBBIDFE7ZZWK	made me cry. can't wait for the next book. Enjoyed reading the ups and downs. happy and sadness. the fighting and protective that the brothers were	3
5769	A1G07KM8GV52U4	I enjoy reading Jack & Abby story. Also, I like reading how both characters survived abuse at the hand of a parent and how they protected their sibling (s).	3
5770	AZOEFTXUBH0QH	This could be a comic book or made for TV movie but it is not a good book.  So glad I did not pay for this drivel	0
5771	A3FDQPDZM7JNVM	Good read although somewhat predictable. Would like to have a little more in the ending, but still a good read.	2
5772	A23FVEMKVWDQGW	The book had potential but ended too soon. Dialogue was confusing with too many characters to keep track of.  It didn't give much insight into the Amish culture.	1
5773	A3E8YLPYJZ4BIH	however it wasn't scary.  I found the story interesting, but I am still on the hunt for an extremely scary story.  The search goes on.....	2
5774	A2AWDLQMUTEDBD	Sharon Cullen created a pleasing story with some steamy sessions along thee way. Good book enjoyed reading and will read other novels by Ms. Cullen again,	3
5775	A356K1MI6WSXPS	I did not enjoy this book at all.  It was not exciting and I knew it would not keep my niece's attention.	0
5776	A2H0H8ET4XEYB2	Not very well written. I couldn't get into it. Hocking's books tend to end abuptly, perhaps so you'll buy the next one since the story is not really over.	1
5777	A1QGZRRHYS0WJ6	Fantastic action and equal romance.  Never got bored.  Really looking forward to the next one.  Dana Marie Bell is an incredible author.  I'll read everything she writes.	3
5778	A14WIDZ4GBET7A	Didn't really like the book.  It was an easy read but didn't do much for me.	0

5782	A2014L4LCC9VDD	I enjoyed this book.  Very well written and would suggest to any of my friends easily :) :) :) :)	3
5783	A3HA21MYH5EPQP	Good read too short but a page turner. To learn Unique demons check out Nikki Turner short stories.Project chicks. Get down	3
5784	A2CXM3KTFM6QVB	Book was an okay read. I liked the first one better. I wish you would help Lanya make up her mind. The chick is bipolar. Just didn't flow...	1
5785	A2VL8HNTA3K706	I was looking for a quick romantic read to pass the time and happened upon this book. It was fast paced romance and I enjoyed reading it.	3
5786	A31MN9X90I4SB6	This is a very cute book to read with your kids and grandkids. Can't wait to get my grandkid so I can read this with her.	3
5787	A3CDQNIF1PA3S7	The first book was good enough for me read the 2nd, but this was not as good as the first.	0
5788	AOFFDLEDB29FD	It was a really good book, it was a little confusing when it would switch back and forth to her and another person, but over all a really good book	3
5789	A3LLZC3MT5PYP2	This predictable first book of a series wasn't really worth the time. Neat idea just so predictable. Newfie hero springs into action to save the day	2
5790	A1IFW23QZH6RHE	If your 40 and over, this book is juvenile. Characters immature. If i hadn't paid, i would not finished book.	0
5791	A1XT3AD3YQXARO	This book made me laugh and I liked that the author incorporated some popular fairy tales in the story. Farting is definitely an unusual super power to have.	2
5792	A2VLJI0BOD5ROO	Very short story. Pretty predictable on how it would end. I do feel that it could have been a better story.	2
5793	A2CYUEFLYG72CW	Ben Mulhern developed several interesting story lines in this book.  Sometime it is difficult to follow. The jump to another unrelated plot causes the reader to get lost.	2
5794	AXEXMX7T9RDCZ	I enjoyed reading this book.  It was a fast read.  It was not too long.  It was entertaining.  It's handy to have a kindle.  I ordered it from Amazon books.	2
5795	ACI0BU8MADJJ2	It was very close to the story of 'V', with more redneck overtones. It would suit survivalists down to the ground. It would just reinforce their worldview.	1
5796	A61TPF208Q1K6	Just another money grubbing author that thinks it's ok to write continuation short stories.  It's insulting.  Just write a real length novel and charge accordingly if you want money.	0
5797	A1BOMG1T4FWXWD	I chose this rating because it has impropriety words in it and is not child appropriate. My rating is one star. :(	0
5798	ANF2F6YCJL4H7	This was a good read. Kept my interest and was entertaining.  Had a good story line and the main character was interesting also. Was an easy read.	3
5799	A3VZEQDE2YDHLP	This book is disappointing in its message and is too focused on paranoid ideation to fully explore characterization or deliver on a fully functioning plot.	0
5800	A33OXM7LDFO22K	My young grandson can find this on my Kindle Fire and has essentially memorized it.  He's delighted to have a book on his grandmother's Kindle.	3
5801	ADVIEBPYI4DQ3	Melody Snow Monroe gives good sex!  Leather and Lace was and insanely hot read and is sure to provide an enjoyable time out.	3
5802	A18MOG89UURP7K	A good quick read. Sad in some aspects, so true in real life. I love happy endings tho, andlook forward to next book.	2
5803	A3IGCC8LX1UMRV	Some playful and fun graphics of a dragon. Not a huge storyline, but what are some people expecting for an ABC book!Definitely better targeted towards 1-3 year olds.	3
5804	A1Q5EBGVAKXH6R	As this is a series, would like to see more character and story devlopment. Seems like story is just there to get to the next death-defying action scene	3
5805	A3SIOVQ5SSRMW6	Another funny and sweet match making adventure! A great addition to the welcome to hell series, I can't wait for the next!!!	3
5806	A37C4F2R76E8MM	The tips provided are simple but sometimes often forgotten by married couples.I will definitely keep them in mind whenever my marriage hits a rough patch.	3
5807	A2KEJ8AWEMI0HJ	I like her stories. It is a little far fetched but sweet just the same. It was great to see a happy ending.	3
5808	ATV4BVLPCGGBC	Started this series and now I'm addicted, I couldn't wait to read the first three installments. Great imagination, fast paced, sad, funny and exciting all in one.	3
5809	A3P54TEGGQ9NPR	Although this is supposed to be a teenage point of view, the teenage style in which I didnt find amusing. It dragged for me, not funny.	0
5810	AFY8QLS51NVI3	I didn't like one of the main characters very much but overall I enjoyed the book and found the topic unique and interesting.	3
5811	A3R7VPA6XJS8KS	Very good fantasy book. Geared more towards teenagers.	3
5812	A22E0L5BM7OQ2Q	I enjoyed all three of these stories.  I especially liked the fact that all three stories in the series are in one book.	3
5813	A36SKOVCAHP4WE	i liked this story and enjoyed the characters.  i read it quickly as it moves along pretty good.  not the best i've read, but definitely a good story.	3
5814	A1GX6A7OX5N1P6	This book was surprisingly good! I love Triste! If this story continues, Janay will be her downfall. I recommend this for all to read.	3
5815	A3VXLC12A4GC5F	I enjoyed this story very much. It was easy to follow and I was glad that it all worked out in the end.	3
5816	A2M9R0K2DR7OGT	I liked this one because it had some really funny areas. It let the wicked vamp become the unexpected hero.	3
5817	A3DADGJ726XF4M	This series was good, this third book kinda ties everything up and it was definitely not the best one of the series.	2
5818	A1G6VT6ISLANS3	I thought that there was a little gap in the storyline. I think it was a really good book BUT it depends on the reader.	2
5819	A1FV0SX13TWVXQ	I didn't get past the first page because the foul language was unacceptable to me.  That kind of language is an assault to my ears.	0
5820	A22KC6KLCUQ846	For a short story, it was ok.  Any longer story and the plot would have gotten boring.  Plot wasn't that strong.	2
5821	A1JZ9AFH5AIKNT	This series surprised me. This story shocked me from time to time. Through all three books I had &#34; damn!&#34; moments.	3
5822	A2TYVZQ0UB6MOX	I was looking forward to the final treasure being found and the guy geting the girl. This was even better.	3
5823	A1QVRO7FNATJKX	For me the book was a slow start but like the romance in the book it totally takes off.  The characters are wonderful, and realistic.  Cute read	3
5824	A2OJWOF11PQYAX	AAA quick interesting romantic read for any age group. The story holds your interest and keeps you wondering if you have guessed the outcome.	3
5825	A2DTXQE1G307XN	I have tried to get interested in this book. I still haven't gotten more than half way through it. A bit boring. But a free book, so thank you Amazon.	1
5826	A63FKF0FTK8DQ	Oliver these big books. Can't wait to read the next one. I just kept laughing at this crazy girl. Love her good friend Dana. And brad dad us funny.	3
5827	AUR86H71FYVQL	Family secrets, wounded souldier, family at odds, and a bright college girl. Isolated in a wintery country side, romance heats up !	2
5828	A7HT78BONF9QS	Learned some new stuff. But already knew 75% or more from Amazon websitegood for novices or people with advanced phones (  got a simple non web phone myself)l	2
5829	A32AUTWA8MM81K	Yes, this is a stand alone book.  But the other tow books gives all the characters much more depth.  Some graphic sex, easy to a kip past.	3
5830	AYTQAMRPXHTA8	Cool story, not too complex, finished the book in one night.  Was expecting a little more character development or parallel storyline	2
5831	A3HTCOOHD7HICU	This was a short entertaining read. I look forward to reading more books by this author. I love romance mixed with a little mystery.	2
5832	A8H2YKW9QYEYD	The Blaines and friends keep you hoping they can make their tripwithout too much trouble, if they could you wouldn't read the book !!I enjoyed it	3
5833	AR16G2FPTTWJF	Bad tale told poorly. May be suitable to a 2 year old but you won't want to read this dumb book again. Icky.	1
5834	A1RZ2C2A9O85CG	I love breakfast so this one was a good find.  A different take on breakfast but still tasty.  Would recommend to download.	3
5835	A33106OQOWEBGY	Easy reading, something good for a cold wet rainy day.  Found it very easy to get into and in parts found it hard to put down.	3
5836	AL9GUNPJOYWD0	This was a fun and interesting book! I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading more from this series.	3
5837	A2LJDXLT5OTV5E	weird way to throw these two characters together but it worked!can't wait to read the next in the series.	2
5838	A1WNWGDWDBH88E	Where should I start. The overall story line is ok. It would have been a great book if it wasn't for the massive editing errors from hell.	2
5839	A1N4PNGHPYTFVX	A good sequel, thankfully, Not everyone gets it right. character development and plot were entertaining. Looking forward to the next installment.	3
5840	A29Q2RCBE6HXYL	I really couldn't like Dante, or Keith, and I wasn't too sure about Noah. I thought he could do better than either of them, though.	1
5841	A3OS2O5Z6ZN63U	HOT HOT HOT!! Little short, but sweet. Sexy little fantasy!!  I fully enjoined reading it! Next time I get some ink I'll be thinking about this shortly...lol	3
5842	A31ZG2Z2SI7JD2	Scalzi writes well and it is usually fast paced.  Has some tongue and cheek. Works wel with a futuristic probable background. He will only get better.	3
5843	AF6H7QH3ZLLT3	It was a ok read, but way to short and the ending was unfinished sort of. I would like to know how the relationship went.	2
5844	A1RHGFNZHF137T	This book started off a little slow for me but definitely pickup up quick..drama..drama and more drama...U did ya thang Sevyn McCray!	3

5846	A3QUIN03JKHTEE	This book was good but way to short for my liking. Really good story line but not enough detail and just ended abruptly.	1
5847	A3PP9V4NLMHQE8	A very interesting storyline.  Stories of half angel hybrids are coming to be as popular as vampires in pop culture.  We'll see how complex this story becomes.	3
5848	AYAEINQR30YL5	Well written, fairly well developed characters. I enjoyed it very much and will read sequels.  The storyline held my attention.	3
5849	A26SGH9G2HJQ6H	I am glad I didn't stop reading this, I started to because it started off slow, but got interesting midway through. Fine read.	3
5850	A2VAV1IKNDTMAX	Good, well written and vedry believable story.  Characters could be the people next door and their actions/reactions are right on.	3
5851	A1ZKVP1UYZEJAY	Northstar Angel Series Book #1: Mountain Angel by Suzie O'Connell was a gripping story which incorporated, not only mystery and adventure, but also humor and romance.	2
5852	A2BZPA4HEC52A3	Just not for me.Cannot relate to any of the characters.Emotions and ideals so obvious...Hard to believe the main character so unaware.	0
5853	A2IYKD5FKJ3XL1	I enjoyed this book.  Like the way Diamond went back and forth as she told the story.  I recommend it most definitely.	3
5854	A1LHAHU0DG4SR1	This is a very erotic & romantic story of how fate as a way of getting this pair of unlikely lovers together. A must read.	3
5855	A3JGY8WYUZBU6D	Not my favorite from Ms. Fox. I didn't like the heroine and was often annoyed by her behavior. And there was not enough sex in this story for me.	1
5856	A3087OTS57A534	A sweet love story	3
5857	A1OKS5Q1HD8WQC	An interesting take on a space opera. Two  love crossed lovers who finally get to have a happy ever after at the end of the book	3

5859	A3YKMA025VQ3J	Monroe and Zach were the perfect doms.  I love the development of the characters as the story progressed. I plan the look for more books by Holly Roberts.	3
5860	ANMODBIUN7ZJP	I was a little surprised by the books ending .But this is a reminder of God's great love for us and that we should always have faith in him.	2
5861	AV8FEINZC45YI	It was a very cute story however, I wish it were longer. :) I definitely refer this book to anyone who likes romance.	3
5862	A33H90GGA5BPS5	"I have been thrilled with this series.  The romance is hot and the suspense is thrilling.  I just downloaded ""Every Breath She Takes"" and can hardly wait to get started."	3
5863	A1FGATWWL9SXAE	A good read and filled with interesting information about people you would never actually hear about otherwise. Maybe one of these people are a relative?	3
5864	AFVLB4TT40F2I	Good book.  Predictable! I like sappy romances. But you always know how they will end. They fight their feelings and finally give in to them.	3
5865	ASOJO66U3PESP	With an open mind, I read this book and I really enjoyed it, nice happily ever after. Wasn't too graphic, very tastefully written	3
5866	A3JY596TL8C65W	It started off well but as it continued it got sort of &#34;Ho-hum&#34; and to me the end just tapered off into nothing.	2
5867	A282JW8YCDWV2W	This was such a funny book. Well thought out and fun to read. Very light, not religious in its tone.	3
5868	A2RD0IPA89GSDS	Just a great as all the other books by this author. Glad I got it wasn't going to but glad I did	3
5869	A3KSWZ1NQULWQE	I really liked all of the characters except the hero. He was a self-absorbed jerk. There were times I wanted to smack the heroine for wanting him.	3
5870	APDE11MF1OYU3	I LOVED this book!  It was a fun, sexy read!  I finished the book in an hour, the world around me disappeared while I was reading!	3

5872	A2KG7AJ3FGIZ4N	Lots of laughs as two people meet and go on a trip with wild antics and the building of a wild romantic love for one another	3
5873	A7LD1TK5M7VAS	Too short to be areal story and so don't expect one and over before you even get interested in whats happening	0
5874	A25OG8Y6OFB1U4	I really enjoyed reading about all there little adventures. To get to know what the other characters think n feel.	3
5875	A1SOEVVJ8THYTX	Not good read better from mercer.  Bit slow but because started book had to finish to see what happens. Bad	1
5876	A3S42FFFACQSCK	Did not read.... Not fair to rate low in that event, but I just had had enough of this series.	1
5877	AQ5CXWVVMA1UU	It had a good plot line.  The heroine and hero were believable.  I would like to see more books along this genre.	3
5878	A3CMIEYL0TJLC2	It was a good not great but good I love the story and I love the character Saxton and Odessa are amazing	3
5879	A26N5JRAXN8XB5	This was a good book.  Kinda different but once I got into it, I enjoyed it...  Hard to follow sometimes...	2
5880	A32AUTWA8MM81K	A sweet coming of age Christian romance.  The author knows her genre.  The story is a good sketch of learning how to evolve I pioneer times.	2
5881	A13R6TBLRB7Y4H	I didn't get the whole book.  I didn't enjoy it and would not recommend this to anyone.  I was disappointed as I read another Joyce book and loved it.	1
5882	A3TSFC86MSXI5Q	This book is just silly fluff. An entertaining read, but I had to mock it as I was reading it. Props to the author for the creativity.	2
5883	A38T75991S1UTS	Mitchell does it again! I Married A Bear was a great read, if you love shifters and want something different than wolf shifters, this book is for you!	3
5884	AX90KBI2IHCZQ	I thoroughly enjoyed the main character in this book and thought the plot was riveting. I liked it enough to buy the next one in the series!	3
5885	A3G6NIH6YGEUIL	Good little short stories about haunted places in Louisiana This gives you just a brief description of each place with a small amount of detail. .	3
5886	A1JB6XDCMHNVAI	Good book. Already bought book two and have a strong feeling will be getting more of them.  It kept my interest and had trouble putting it down.	3
5887	A14OVPT5X6YYK9	WELL WHAT CAN I SAY BUT ANOTHER COOKIE CUTTER BOOK ONLY DIFFERENT  NAMES. PLEASE ADD A BIT SPICE TO THEM & extend the story a bit m o 're.	2
5888	A1B7DR0K0VCMM	Good starting of the story.  I could not put it down till I finished reading it. Thank you so very much for writing it.	3
5889	A1IO64VZRGWRUI	This kindle stuff does not lighjt my fire in any way shape or form. I do not like it, I do not like it.	0
5890	ADUUENMNLAFOT	I don't mind a little sex but do need a plot and some story. I delete the book without finishing.	0
5891	A2T1PPC2P1NJ9F	I found the story to be entertaining, but rather predictable.  We know who wins in the end. The editorial errors were a bit challenging.	2
5892	A2G7V4PZINDKVK	I enjoyed reading this book, but didn't find it to be as captivating as others that I have read. It was OK, but not a special book for me.	2
5893	A2LFWDAWORQWHL	Strong character and an okay plot. What really keeps you in the story is the characters. I say good job	2
5894	A1DDQ0SU7X9RCW	Although very short it gives a good preview of the author's ability to weave a story. I will definitely look for another book by Hope Walker.	2
5895	A3LXB4NZSYS6C7	This was an OK book but it was too slow for my taste. It was predictable, although the who-done-it did take me a bit by surprise.	2
5896	AEF95DUU2GLHY	This is a cute series. Not my kind of book and a little slow but good for an easy weekend read.	2
5897	A33XBOE8AUOT1	I liked this story.  I don't usually like the historically set romance novels but this one had enough mystery and suspense to keep me interested.	3
5898	A00463782V7TKAP9EMNL	I'm hoping this is the first in a series!  There is just enough angst to make the characters interesting and the love scenes leave you wanting more!	3
5899	A1AO2I56LKH3L5	Somethimes it wouldnt act right as in letting me pick the correct answers but over all it is fun to have.	3
5900	A2Z9MCPYR95ZWR	I don't know if I need to re-download my e-book, but I have no pictures.  I noticed this when reading the chapter on the Royal Wedding.	2
5901	AFIH80GNTHP5C	It was a fun story to read at the beach. I have never been to Greece but this book made me want to travel	3
5902	A3N2937IX58GGY	Groupings of sermon excerpts by topic.  Very good Bible related information from the Anglican (Church of England) viewpoint.  I recommend it.	3
5903	A33362T2PJUVKI	This book did little more than kill time for me.  The characters are undeveloped and you feel no investment to them or the story they are investigating.	2
5904	A1H4D30I2V9EUT	This book was short yes but how can the writer finish the story like that this book was a waste	1
5905	A1RRGLIM1F7B18	It shows how sometimes the most horrifying things can turn out to be some of God's greatest gifts. I really enjoyed the book.	3
5906	A4WHGB7WJIF0I	What is the point of releasing stories this way?Irritating. If the author had disclosed that it was just a segment of a story I never would have ordered it. Frustrating.	0
5907	A35M41OM66SZ4T	Nice story. Easy reading. Not a lot of depth or expanded characterization but an interesting plot. I still feel as if I missed part of the story.	3
5908	A3AQ6UJBWFOHFW	I quite enjoyed all three of these stories and would certainly try these authors again, although the third story was a bit too short.	3
5909	A1FSR426FVMQJI	Glenn tells a very convincing tale. Makes one wonder how much of it could be true.Too many secrets out there.	3
5910	A2C1AZGM3GCZUV	Tis may be great for those who actually like cauliflower, this book is for you. I tried some of the recipes,  but not really liking it, its not for me.	0
5911	AHSSR56DP930K	It's not as brilliant as the novel  - there is no coherent story -  but I enjoyed returning to the world of A.	3
5912	A1H1UEDPDQWOBS	A lot of good information.  I would have liked more detail in certain areas, but there were still lots of good tips.  Much of it can be applied elsewhere also.	3
5913	A1EQCUZWK90CJA	Good and clean and enjoy to read! They learn how change their life and happy!  They accept that boy become their parents	3
5914	A2N3X7514J2COM	A nice comfortable mystery detective story in the Joe Denali series.  Relationships are the key here and are explored with deftness .  I enjoyed it.	3

5917	A2FRYJJ1JSDV5S	I love to read realistic books with believable characters.  I enjoyed Gemma's character.  I am looking forward to the next book in the series.  Kudos to PM May!	3
5918	A19COUGKGEBSW7	I enjoyed reading the story but wish it had been longer.  I question Matt's choice of a 50 Desert Eagle, but that's me.	3
5919	A19J2OCTTM85LD	A quick and spicy read. Very well written.  It made me giggle and also brought tears to my eyes.  You can't go wrong with this one.	3
5920	AJ9JRKE8AADW0	It was a neat tool to those who are familiar with the world of Divergent. It gives insight on the factions and how Roth created her world.	3
5921	A28MLNFA6YTA48	These are fairly basic recipes but a good start for those who can't dream of not having gluten products in their life.	3
5922	A6EAXALXUOFHY	A thriller with romance thrown in there. I would love a Tom of my own. I hope that no one ever has to go through this too	3
5923	AWG2Y42W9RNNK	This is a very cool book- great to read for anyone who is in combat, martial arts, self defense class, etc.	3
5924	A3TDJTFS55RLTO	Good Story, if you like the strong alpha males,you will like this book. Ripp and Vee have a good story. Humor and love. Looking forward to the next book.	3
5925	APY5MZFV36WBN	LOW CLASS RUBBISH  I COULD HARDLY SMILE, ONLY ONE OR TWO GOOD LAUGHS. I WONT LOOK FOR MORE EVER AGAIN	0
5926	A3JASVF01JUMV8	Really liked this short story with a nice ending! Certainly did not see that one coming and made it even all the more enjoyable and suoer hot!	3
5927	A1K943ALS5T61K	Wasn't that steamy, didn't really reel me in or interest me enough to see what will happen next. This book was not for me.	1
5928	A3T4BBX7C1E8CH	This was really a fun read. The character s are a hoot and the plot is pretty good.Would recommend to my friends.	3
5929	A1PD8ATHE7IMKO	Fast paced and exciting read. I couldn't put this book down. Excellent character development and plot twists to keep the story moving quickly.	3
5930	A2C343QHVGY8FV	Not a bad, although unoriginal plot.  What was very distracting, however, was the need for major copy editing.  Almost every page has some sort of grammatical error.	2
5931	A2DWBCW3PCK3G6	Hot and heavy. Nice read a little predictable but extremely enjoyable.  Great if you like possession of you characters. Interesting plot twist initially. Good to see that mix up.	3
5932	A2Y0R726SERNPH	Good story line - way too short of story that could have been one book. Believable characters, believable story too.	3
5933	AE6DA37MB0JXP	Pretty good read--only reason I didn't go five stars was because I can't give EVERYONE a five star; then no one would believe me.  But fun read	3
5934	A23MMF3NZPU8WF	Good murder mystery. Kept u on your toes. Enjoyed the determination of Jane Doe to pick u the pieces & move on.	3
5935	A29WRHY05JWWAK	It gives a great lesson for  young men and young women. It is also a good article for victims of sexual abuse	2
5936	A2Y2D7PBEU3HFZ	This book was just OK.  I finished it but it didn't keep my attention. I put it down several times.	2
5937	A32SX7B3OT2078	I wish this had been a novel.  I loved the concept and the execution wasn't bad, either.  I really wanted to know more about these people.	3
5938	A241C3BP8EGSOI	A little more boring then the last books, but still an enjoyable read.	2
5939	A10QDELF0VZ6HG	Very strange book. Didn't like it and couldn't recommend. It was a horrible ending. Couldn't find the pleasure I usually associate with reading a good book.	1
5940	A1F3AVUZXP4XS5	Bubba and his family are a hoot.  I enjoyed reading all the books in the series.  Especially when they are free!	1

5944	A26HUP7BIYNF8F	the language in this book was offensive and unnecessary for me. often the reviews mention this but I missed it if any did. I didn't compete the book.	0
5945	A35VNGMUH59VCH	I chose 4 stars because I really liked the book. Easy to read and very informative. I always buy books about visualization and this one was worth it.	3

5947	A3DJNTUEE7546E	Not bad at all just way too short. Just got started and it was over too soon. Just when it was getting interesting.	0
5948	A8ESDG0H73R0Y	Good book, however so much time is used building up the story for such a quick ending. A few grammar errors but not a bad book.	2
5949	A3ES0XIED7769J	A woman fighting love because of her past, her job and because of age. Mostly age. Finding it doesn't matter.	3
5950	A1L5KFMGI6Y6DD	I tried on multiple occasions to read this book and couldn'tt. Finally I gave up realizing that this story was just a waste of time trying to read.	0
5951	A1HMUR5S6BNU1O	This book started out great and was a pretty good but then just ended! I was let down; not a book I would recommend really.	1
5952	A2IWYBQDH6POKP	This is filled with short, to-do focused chapters.  The trick is to get up and do them!  We all need to be reminded what to do.	2
5953	A3LUT1TQX0CU0R	Started out fine.  Thought it would be a light, chick lit humorous story, but the subject matter quickly turned dark.  Could not finish reading it.	2
5954	AW5FC3UW07RIF	I ended up reading this very quickly.  I liked how you could see their fake relationship becoming more, even though that's not what they were planning.	3

5957	A2FQSAW0ZEO8A7	Great series, would give the other books 5 stars. Nuttall through these stores makes some interesting observations about society, perhaps even our own, through a brilliant series of stories.	3
5958	A36KCHLUNWFG87	meh. it was okay.	2
5959	A5EMBLH67EL8H	The heroine is strong and falls hard for Chaos. The romance was raw and honest. I enjoy it however, I can't wait for Pussy's story!!!!	3
5960	A1G4J5F0J0JMXR	Shelter from the storm is good reading. As always Patricia Ryan's books are always good to read which shows his flair foe writing.	1

5966	A7BJB12NIAGM4	This was short and very different. It was different and though it did have a twist at the end it was not to my liking. Judge for yourself.	1

5971	AMAVWR7GSC8KZ	If all rent a husbands turned out like this, I would sign up. Minus the suspense part. I won't  spoil it. Good book.	3

5976	AXZ5OEBMR22YN	this book had me interested all the way through it and i wasn't left disappointed. i recommend this book to everyone.	3
5977	A1I5L545PT578C	Heather Graham grabs your attention & keeps you wondering.  She does a good job of spinning her story  for the &#34;short story&#34; format.	3
5978	A1J70BVQN2L78N	"I wanted to know how to find private money lenders. This book should be called ""How to prepare for your private money lenders meeting"" Not impressed :-("	0

5980	A3EW0QL25AS6KM	Ms Cooper demonstrates impeccable research and tells an engaging story. It was a departure from her usual genres however I enjoyed every word! More like this please. Fascinating stuff!	3
5981	A2F1W47VI68ETE	I like the book, would have been more fun to see how every thing turns out in the end. Very fun, could be any girls dream.	3

5986	AGQOKD38KJYO3	It was clear how the book was going to end up, but I just didn't love reading through to get there.	2
5987	A3E67C7D48XKGN	This is a very believable romance story. It keeps your interest from beginning to end and leaves you wanting more.	3
5988	A30QNW64ISXF79	Great story. I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but it needs a proofreader! Too many words ran together, which distracted some.	3
5989	A3CU5LZJ29UAR3	Nice read. Easy plot, enjoyable characters, funny remarks, page turner. What can i say? A short story that is a good start  to read.	2
5990	ADZQYE8IH399B	Good story but all the grammatical errors were distracting.  I did like how the storyline kept one guessing as to the ending.	1
5991	A231578O00SRNP	It didn't really keep the interest of my eight-year-old grandson as much as I thought it would sort of disappointed a little too complicated for that age group	3
5992	AC7424C3VPAZL	But good regardless. Entertaining and cute to read, this book will make you smile after a crappy day at work. Just what I needed tonight!	3
5993	A2IB7Y8Z9VXL6F	As usual, EJD goes hard. This pulled me in from the first paragraph...I was caught up in the story then BAM! Story over. I want more...	3
5994	A2S9L1CPV5I1Y5	Very useful tips and guidance.  Told in a way that is easy to understand and follow.A worthwhile read.Alan	3
5995	A3THQ124ONSAK4	This might be one of the worst free books I have ever read. Please don't waste your time with this one.	0
5996	A1S9Q93ULUO391	I enjoy reading books set in the southwestern states. This had all the elements needed for a good story.  Good guys win most of the time,but there are always sacrifices.	3
5997	A3KB5MPIR5W3SS	I really didn't like this very well.  Too much family drama for me.  Didn't hold my interest and I wouldn't buy another of this series.	1
5998	A7RWGB3967MYR	Really didn't get into any of these stories even though I have enjoyed other bundles from Amazon.	1
5999	AUCCSXHL600EQ	An interesting story but a little long and sometimes boring.  What happened  to the perfect place to raise a family didn't last too long.Makes one wonder.	2
6000	A2SHO0AARA0NBT	This is a cute story with appealing characters.  There were only a few mistakes, nothing to detract from the story.  Worth the time.	3
6001	A24IGF4YDDLJZ9	Very, very, very, short. It was ok , but not what I ,expected. My six year old's books are much longer.	2
6002	AVME21TX56BSW	I guess I expected more from a &#34;powerfast&#34; adapter.  Charging time has been around 3-4 hours for a full charge.	1
6003	A2XVJ2M3ZWQ4DA	Hot hot hot - love this series.  A must read that you will love and you won't regret purchasing it.	3
6004	A3KWLE7H7QYUOJ	You can do an amazon search or google search and find anything you can find here. I found it useless you just do not not need it.	0
6005	A6SZN9UICOZ2T	This was a fun read. The writing is good, the characters are interesting and fairly well drawn. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good m/m read.	3
6006	A36KQKKQJRB8C7	Reminds me of Ray Bradbury,in as it makes you stop and think. This type of short story, you remimber for years, and ponder for a while.	3
6007	A38YP4010L8749	Predictable as for the romance, but was still entertaining.  It was a quick read and I would recommend people read this if you like love stories.	3
6008	A38OEBWWF3NPIS	The sory was well constructed and the characters were developed, but it just came off as incomplete to me. It was OK, but a little overpriced for what it was.	2
6009	A2CLRO4SZ8EPOS	Interesting story if somewhat improbable.  Romance scenes were descriptive and hot enough to be considered &#34;adult&#34; subject matter. Gruesome crime descriptions.	3
6010	A3UPYWRAV79LRA	Good quick read. Really wish there was a sequel or that you eventually learned his name. Don't like the cliffhanger ending since there is no mention of a follow up.	3
6011	A556L66JGOVPK	Honest Reviews by MsDawn Burton at msdawnburton@gmail.comStory line was very enjoyable. I liked the large close family angle but I prefer less sex and hence kept skipping pages.	3
6012	A1LFOII74LAFOI	Sex...Furry ears...sex.....Kidnap 1000  women,,,chase them down...furry ears sexI couldn't finish the book. I picked up the above info. I got it for free I shouldn't complain	1

6014	AJ5U3884TE6J0	Good book on gaining insights into your dog's thinking. New dog owners especially would be helped by the advice given.	3
6015	A1BWH5QZWF2U2G	The story wasn't that interesting and as it has a to be continued ending it was disappointing.  It's not that good that I want to read the sequel.	2
6016	ACQ3XDXG1N1G3	It could have been great. The book seemed to have promise, but everything fell flat. Sadly, I wasn't able to get through this one with the repetitiveness and weak story.	0
6017	A2F33EBHBWO1J0	It was Okay. Before I knew it I was done. It left me wondering where the rest of it was. Information was good.	2
6018	AXUSKNP4ACW6J	Lots of tips to make baking easier! Quick to point out recipes can be used for either muffin or loaves to bake fresh.I liked this book of recipes.	3
6019	AYB90RJXY32BI	Really good read. I enjoyed the characters and story immensely. Very good to hear more about the characters and story..	3
6020	A21AL4DVLS6MAH	I would have liked to have photos and actual suggestions of specific plants to combine in pots.  The info in this book is fine for the beginner.	2
6021	A3QCP3XOFS9M20	Another great installment. Its definitely getting more interesting now both Dane and Storm are there. A bit of a shock at the end, can't wait to read the next one	3
6022	A1K6HATE4C4G1R	Loved the book but it was way to short! I would have loved to figure out what happened to him exactly. The end hinted at something but still no answers	2
6023	A1LBQ0QBA1MTEZ	Great comedy and charactors.  Fell off a bit near the end and a little over the top.  Over all a fun read.	3
6024	A2DTZD973Q854O	I feel like this story has been don over and over. Good mindless read. It was a little confusing going from past and present.	1
6025	APZ15I39E3A2W	Enjoying the relationship with Lacy, Jason and Michael develop. Great to get some background on Michael. Loved the personality flip-flop of Lacy and Jason. And quite a surprise ending!	3
6026	A2QV424NAKZCZZ	Although the subject is abhorrent, as an abused child myself, I know the feelings of the characters well. Happy endings for all of us!	3
6027	A3TE038NLTPLYT	Was a cute story..just too short..could have had more of a story line... wish there would have been more to it..	2
6028	A1XL1A3TCU3Y1I	Another good book hope you all like it .great timing and good go around of love and how to get there. So enjoy!	3

6032	A1YBW1QTYUC88V	This was a quick read, and I found it to be informative. Before reading I was not aware of many of the potential benefits discussed here.	2
6033	ACOJYS9IWGC9U	I enjoyed the title story, but quickly became bored with the other offerings that flesh out the book and did not finish it.	2
6034	A130YNB9A5B9J9	The main 'hero' bored me to tears, he was no where NEAR an Alpha status. Long drawn out plot, I couldn't keep track of. Seriously wanted to punch the guy.	0
6035	A12UDATYZEMM20	I did not like the ending, the story is to be continued and is for more of a young adult age.	2
6036	A36WAYLIH040GU	This was a story with good detail and thought nicely.  Wasn't a favorite of mine.  Might look up other books....	2
6037	A1JL9ZT8PL5J0Z	Thank you Ruth Logan Herne for writing a book with great and believable characters. Remaining words written simply to comply with the minimum word count requirement.	3
6038	AZB17DVFTF12R	Loved the story line. . The characters are too cute.. I want me a horse handler too.  It shows love and hope will win out every time.	3

6041	A159KGBWFLDWR2	A very interesting plot, I think I am getting over all the amish books I have read, I think the stories are getting too bland	2
6042	A2OL77YC9AZOIX	The first Henry Wright I read.  that inspired me to order two more which I have read with the same interest	3
6043	A3SRMK9AF1BAII	The book wasn't very well written and the plot was not good. The main character was too lame and the ending was too abrupt.	1
6044	A1VO56F7YOVGQ7	I hate that this is the conclusion, but if it must be, this is the best on I could've imagined.	3
6045	A3F4MCRN9WEKCV	Very well written, I couldn't put it down. Will definitely read more from this author. 5 4 3 2 1	3
6046	A369YHM3JMH0FS	This book is not funny.  I've seen these jokes in forwarded emails.  I'm deleting from my kindle.  Jokes are not funny.	1
6047	A86ZZ9LEX94BG	The book was gory describing every detail.  I gave this book three stars because it's not one of my favorites.	2
6048	A2Q6MVFL3UUZE4	Each story was well written,  and seemingly left me looking for more.  I look forward to the next available issue	3

6051	A9PAX66DGWGRE	I was very disappointed in this book. The description didn't give a true portrayal. I can't recommend this book because I felt it was really lacking.	1
6052	AV2295RBJ2Z9R	This book was good. I liked the storyline, but couldn't give it a five star rating. It was more like a hallmark story. Not enough suspense and mystery.	3
6053	A12AIK6DSUF1EW	I wanted to read something by Poe but this is not the book I should have selected. It is a good book - just not for me.	2
6054	A3UUCM0KED1KB	It was a bit predictable in some small ways.  A bit too much coincidence and unbelievable timing for the story, but well written and very readable.	2
6055	AYKMA6K01U9A3	Wonderful book, inspiring and inspired.  I was truly touched by this book, and the characters within.  Completely worthy of reading!	3
6056	A1WEYTI44LPEOF	Cliffhanger!  But of course, I will continue to read this series because it keeps pulling me in.  Can't wait until the next book!	3

6058	A2PZBM8B7MJ750	This was a fast read and very entertaining.  A must read for anyone who ever thought of taking the plunge and changing their lifestyle.	3
6059	A31PDHYARU5M0G	The love story of a family riddled with problems but christened with love. A little predictable and little less bratty children would have made for a better read.	3
6060	ACMUFCDLD108J	For a short story it was a little underwhelming but what can you really get across in a shirt story. I still enjoy reading whatever Rizzoli and Isles I can.	2
6061	A20M862B358YBK	Good trading!  Story is creative and characters attracted my following their development.  I liked it enogh to read more of the author's stories.	3

6063	A1E33ER4JG5B11	Glad it was free, because this ultra short short-term wasnt worth the 5 minutes it took me to read it.  Give me a break...	0
6064	A1QH6Z2UAAEQ4X	I enjoyed finishing the story of their love and it was well written. Thought it would have been longer tho.	3
6065	A2LXICKJ62RUOL	I thought the book was base on one story I was really interested. At first but it his book became a  bore to me	1
6066	A1RM1BXXU6KJPM	Yep, Emily Snow did it again! I totally loved this book.	3
6067	AKGBH1WWI5M8R	The Wild Side takes you on somewhat of a wild ride. There are so many questions that need to be answered. Very intriguing and extremely hot. Can't wait for Iris.	3
6068	A19MYZUTPOE9OT	I enjoyed and still enjoyed the book, but I thought there would be a few more recipes in the book.	2
6069	A3QD4KDCRN204T	Didn't care for this collection	1
6070	A2K7OZTQV6NTX3	But sure worth the read.  I really enjoyed it.  Had just finished a dark read so it was nice  to read something a bit lighter.	3
6071	A3IR6AB8SNCWNF	Good read. It wasn't at all what I expected, too bad the girls had a fallen out. Looking forward to part 2.	2
6072	A3V49GD86CR6CV	I would recommend any one to get all four books to read together to get the stories to make since of it all. It was a very good selection.	3
6073	AXICH3O86MNUX	This story is entertaining. a few unexpected twists show me that the Author has a creative mind and I like creativity.  A good short entertaining read.	3
6074	A1KKEA0ZPFNACM	This book was very slow moving.  The last half picked up pace, but I am not sure that I would buy more in this series.	2
6075	ARVB43XP3EGVD	It's a warm story that allows one to escape reality, I loved the characters, the way emotions felt real and transported the reader into the situation.	3
6076	A384BKQUZ4RHJF	A sweet story, need a break from too much drama? I recommend you read this story.  A sweet quick read.	3
6077	AN0EV6VUCPGWH	A lot of sex. Very graphic but a short story line. I was amazedhow quickly it ended. Didnt really develop the characters	2

6103	A34V29C2V7532U	I thought that it was a good book, I was hoping that she would get together with Morgan. The book could'vebeen longer.	3
6104	A3C3TF81C3248W	This book was okay. I was expecting a little more detail as to why this happened and how it happened. I would recommend this to true crime history buffs.	2
6105	A3CQ9XAGJ8JAYP	It was an ok read.  Would I purchase again No. Story not well developed  not as in depth as I would have liked for the price..	1
6106	A3DUQEE0RKBHTW	I enjoyed this book it was good if you like mob stories and alpha males who will Kill to protect their women. The story was just two short.	3

6109	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Too short.  A romance the reader comes to in its middle.  Don't think it ended either.  Not that I would jump at reading any more	2

6115	A1NRYBG1S12V5M	This was an exciting roller-coaster ride!  Gloria and Jaime's hot romance coupled with the heart-pounding suspense made for an excellent read.  Belle L'Amour has a new fan, ME!!!!	3

6117	A1TNVUMSPY8BM1	Pretty good book. I enjoyed it. I can't wait for the 2nd part. It was very interesting. She did that	3
6118	A1K049GEW8VDWS	I loved the story. It was different type of heroine and hero. I love an intelligent heroine. Not wishy washy. I recommend that you read the full story.	3
6119	A37B27OCNLX93W	it was a bit to scary with all that blood and people that become dead. this might be to scary for some kids.	1
6120	A23S75597KDAMV	Only four stars because some of the characters that I liked seemed to disappear before their characters were fully developed. This may have been because the books were pushed together.	3
6121	A1IOR3OTTUK3O5	typical jack, and a great quick easy read.....maybe a little too much for a 16 year old (reacher) but still good.	3
6122	A16NSLH9PPOIDR	A good and entertaining book to read. I would have enjoyed more details about her family and marriages. Still factual and good.	3
6123	A2GHVN5GPP69US	Good characters, well written.  There are a lot of stories in these 3 sisters...An enveloping witching world awaits...can't wait for the next one.	3
6124	A2JF032M30V3MS	it was not complex enough for me. I  am used to judith e french's  Indian love stories with true to life Indian lore of the Delaware Indians.l	0
6125	A2WD8RWG891S0I	This was a good tale of magic, dragons and Celtic gods...with humor and passion thrown in for good measure. A most enjoyable read.	3
6126	A197W8MNF706HT	What a pleasant surprise.  A decent story, likable characters and MFM.  The only thing I would have liked was just a little more background on the characters.	3
6127	A33JDM6PGRQRBP	This was a very good read!  Monty is the definition of a lame but I'm feeling Mr. Fresh! However, if you like messy then I recommend this book!	3
6128	A3TW49BUOSO1AC	this story had a new twist and was a good read.  the characters were well developed.  I recommend this book.	3
6129	AKK7D0330MGO7	It was okay, but mostly all over the place.  Monique having all the $ saved but still living with roaches ? Jack is absolutely crazy half killer and half revolutionary.	2
6130	ABGN8JKCLGQKK	Great for kids to get the idea of breaking drawings into sections.  I can also see where these would make great coloring book art.  Very simple basic designs.	2
6131	AVRDLNR8ZTHCE	This is a contemporary romance that has some surprises.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading.  This is book 1 of the Knave of hearts series.	3
6132	A3T1VNFT2GZF9Z	Pretty good but too many fantastical creatures for my taste.  The heroine is sort of juvenile in my opinion.  It has some good moments, however.	2
6133	A1O2MZTHAQ22I0	I enjoyed this series and I can't wait to read the nex book in the series. I would recomed this book. It really draws you in.	3
6134	A1NFM82LE9NHHH	Kinda cute and different than most love stories. Seems more like wishful thinking, maybe for some wished it would be true.	3
6135	A2PS5MUXE34QIE	Didn't know if I would like this but it was very interesting and thought provoking, especially when you consider the time it was written. An easy enjoyable read.	3
6136	A22ORE5H6RMV1Z	Except for the little profanity it was great! Really well put together, one I will keep for a while. Great book!	2
6137	A2CVGY96B5EZ52	I think what I liked best of this set was seeing familiar characters make appearances. However at times they became  quite description heavy, leading me to skim.	3
6138	A14UJ0F71LC1MA	I usually don't read books about two guys and stuff but I really like this but and I'll try to read the next one.	3
6139	AKOLD2E17G0G0	Good story to read if you don't have a lot of time.  Not a great plot, but a little steam and a little romance.	2
6140	A1Q1INBE7NMOQW	This book is not for everyone.  Compliation books rarely are for everyone.  I liked two of the stories and the other two.....not so much.	2
6141	A3CPQ7V88MDVYU	And shallow like a predictable fairy tale.  The only character with much angst was a relatively minor one.  Too neat and sweet.	2
6142	A2SLDQVTX8GJ5O	It was kind of predictable, but the story was good, the characters well written. It kept my interest and was worth the read.	3
6143	A1F2YNU2IU9H6T	This short story just jumps right to erotica.  Not very real life like.  They meet and within a few hours are madly in love.	1
6144	A24EAY1UGKGDGT	Not what I expected well worth it. Delve in and be amazed. Get grasped from the get go. Liked it very much.	3
6145	A1HY5Z0VDGFPK4	I fell in love with this series. Each book was a great continuation of the one before. The characters personalities were likable and enjoyable.	3
6146	A2J69XNJ8RKCFE	I do believe I've found another author I shall enjoy continuing to read. This was only my second book by Leah, but she's got me hooked. Nicely done!	3
6147	A3GN4RSIFV6O20	I enjoyed this book but at times I wanted to read ahead. This is a cross between  a novel and a documentary.	3
6148	A37NWIYG5GXKLV	A totally forgettable book.  I gave it my best and got about a third of the way through it, but just couldn't hang.	1
6149	A3UGH2GQHWS0LN	It was an entertainingly a good read for a freeborn library book on my kindle fire.It's not biblical but I did not expect it was going to be.	2
6150	A3RX2J74X51YDT	It was a cute short story. It moved very fast but was entertaining for the 30 mins or so that it lasted.	2
6151	AC3XB748SWBF5	Cute little story line not the best not as believable as most books story line. Couldn't see this happening in real life.	3
6152	A2ERGFKEKQ1BNR	This would be a good read for a new Christian, and newbies should read all they can to encourage themselves in the faith.	2
6153	A2AZZEHEV40Y1Z	A quick and comical read.  The ending was no surprise, but I still enjoyed the book.  Fun dialogue and characters.	2
6154	A1HEH7OH3IYE34	Sex scenes were pretty erotic but the rest of the story line was so cliche. I skipped through the end of the story because it was so boring	2
6155	ALV0UIJEVXZ2G	This is an okay book for the beginning writer who needs an extra push.  Good motivational tool as well, for those who easily get discouraged.	2
6156	AU8JF316WWHSI	As someone just considering a career in the medical field, this book seems like an honest and eye opening summarization of life as a Medic.	3
6157	AMIK2EY8OZWYK	This book if HOT, HOT, HOT! I couldn't put it down.And not only hot, but Damien is a dream.	3
6158	A2992YYJLV7Q1V	This story goes back and forth between two years. I didn't like how you were trying to find out what was really going through the years between 1996 and 2012.	1
6159	A1MTUJE5W4SLJN	I am about 1/2 way thru the book. It is short, but it is very hot!! I enjoyed it though.	3
6160	A380I4NNBPKC3D	4 stars for a quick read...this is not a novel but a short story about a man getting older.  Has some hilarious little blurbs throughout.  I was amused.	3
6161	A18QFAL30LKMWN	I need more!!!  What a way to end.  Need to find out what happens next.  Really enjoyed reading the book.  I couldn't put it down.	3
6162	A284ZT6NYX47GY	but from what I remember of it, it was a good series. I love Vamp romance books if you do as well. Give it a try!!	3
6163	A1VWDOTUJJNBQ3	I think it is pretty silly that I had to buy this in the first place, it should just come with the Paper-white Kindle.	1
6164	A387C50AGTFZLG	If you like pulp scifi, you'll probably like this.  If you want hard or military scifi, probably not the best choice.	3
6165	AXIO51VZN815F	Cute book with simple, pleasing illustrations every other page and a good family feel. The occasional humor (as present in my title) was also most welcome. Good book!	2
6166	A3AW5WHOHQ5J3W	I was not fond of the format and articles were too brief for me.  I don't know if I would renew the subscription.	0
6167	A3NMO3K0QVQH66	A bit of the old fashioned, I am your boss and you need to sleep with me routine, and of course the end is quite predictable too.But nevertheless enjoyable.	3
6168	A2RFD97HHNZ6J0	A unique twist to the story. I look forward to reading more from this author. So far, I have read two books from this author.	3
6169	AMH6TNJ700272	Enjoyed all the books in this series, would recommend this series to any one who likes to see the good win.	3
6170	A26R6Q42TX1A5F	Great book.... I gave it two stars because it was too rushed and short wish it was longer great start off though..	1
6171	A36F0U8F7Q0LE1	I returned this stand, altho advertised to fit Kindle Fire 8.9, it did not hold the fire securely. Too bad	1
6172	A3UW0DOGV26C7J	I liked this book very much. The writer made me believe in the story which is not always the case.  I did not want it to end.	3
6173	A30HI0OTZGT2K9	An entertaining read with an interestingly flawed lead character. Rather an unnecessarily convoluted ending though. But: it will keep you entertained.	3
6174	A2QP49AWU6EOI	the kids bought this, I think they liked it	2
6175	A2FRLS3YZ5AIS0	I like that showed more emotion than most and the plot had room to elaborate can't wait for the next book.	3
6176	ARRE06VCV02G0	Since it was Nina causing her hell diamond was killed for no reason. Why do Nina hate her so much. Can't wait to read part two	3
6177	A3T9H9B8GMSAZ	The Highland Seer is a good book for a rainy day when you can lose your self in the Irish lit.	2
6178	A2BAWNUI3MH93L	I enjoyed the story. Just some formatting issues that messed with my eyes, but it didn't throw me out of the story. I'd like to see what happens next.	3
6179	A3B1I3EC3O6MXO	It's not the Greyhawk series, but it was a different story.  Interesting and worth the time.  I just wanted more love and less demands.	3
6180	A38YP4010L8749	Nice romance.  Characters were well described.  Kept me entertained and was pleased not to have to get through explicit sex scenes.	3
6181	AAA8DTMKZHBVW	Of the three that I read from this series this is the best one! It got me interesting in it the first two were just boring.	3
6182	A13RKIR0MNWEZ3	Fun read. Wish the author would've made it into a longer story. For the money, it's perfect. A short, sweet story.	2
6183	A3MFKEKW2XJLYK	A decent installment of the series.  Easy to read.  I would like more in-depth character development but I don't think extensive character development is part of idea of the book.	3
6184	AC9AJ0MDZGRGN	Well, rollercoaster sums this book up the best I can. This is a heart breaking love story. Whew. I'm emotionally wore out BUT ... it's a great read.	3
6185	A2KIJBT9HRIOM8	This was cute even if predictable.  Nice and short, which after some of the long books I have read recently, works for me...	3
6186	A2YSZKIZERFIZ5	It's not the most exciting books I've read but i was ok. The story line was a bit too fast and not quite believable.	1
6187	A1LU8W4TR5BG23	This is a good, hot, steamy series.  Jackson has it down when it comes to steamy and hot situations.  Will read again.	3
6188	A3CC0WB4J34KIW	The title would make one think the story might be about Indians rather than mountain men...but it was ok....entertaining enough.	2
6189	A30EAP5P8GZEN7	"Short, obviously belongs with another book in a series and unbelievable.  ""Our"" baby. What a crock!"	0
6190	AGIVP6MB660WP	It was a serious, kind of dark tone. While I prefer a lighter story, it was well written and ended lighter.	2
6191	A165ZFBYAHWO52	This is not a children&#34;s book. I bought it for a 13 year old and I am sorry I did	0
6192	AR4N9QJ67IG2I	The Stage Dive story continues with Mal's story. I expected more humor from such a lovable character, but his angst was understandable. Fun and satisfying read.	3
6193	A2OAAULW8CXMU1	Most cake ball recipes use box mixes for the cake.  It's nice to see a variety of flavorful scratch recipes used instead.	3
6194	A3FMWF7J8HTEOM	The story was ok. I had a problem with the age difference between the two parties a 19 years old girl and a 30 something cop REALLY .	0
6195	A5O15ZVO3FY36	This was a cute story. I like how they met and how they ended up.  I loved the food aspect of it too.	3
6196	ALTC2XJE67A7Z	Cute story,I liked it,kept me interested,liked the ending,tied everything together nicely,will read more by this author,characters were interesting,plot was good	1
6197	A3QBFB6UUP4E20	Quite a good series. A little hard to understand at times and a little bit too gruesome at the end.	3
6198	A16EAKILNT8A0E	This book is very much in the style of Dickens.  I thoroughly enjoyed this tender story and recommend it as an entertaining and engaging read.	3
6199	AFOYAMTVGFBKD	I am hoping this has a follow up book down the road. It had me hooked from the beginning and I was left wanting for more!	3
6200	A2KALEV4WIZE80	love this author. she never disappoints. this story included. sweet story line. a good read about love reunited after time	2
6201	A1X65WZZU6KD71	I love HGTV, buuy I would rather watch it than read it on a small screen.  Stop the trial if you havn't already.	2
6202	A2H19TYZFH5RGY	I love the Wilde books and always wondered about the first ancestors. So reading this short sweet book was a treat.	3
6203	ADV0KDRE6FKX2	I loved this fun easy read! It has a little drama, romance, and funny in some parts!! It was a fast read!!!	3
6204	A18K4TMJWIZ9IB	Ok,........ this book was an okay read for me just thought it would have ended different money was very cold heartef	2
6205	A3UQC2NVG9EOPD	I did like this book, but for me there wasn't a lot of chemistry development between Gavin and Sarabeth.  It's an easy read without a lot of angst.	2
6206	A3B143RS9OTU6F	I enjoyed this book. It does have an interesting plot that is different in a good way. Love Colt, but it is pretty predictable.	3
6207	A3K2AR8R3IG2UT	Just a nice little short story concerning Amish way of life.  Nothing outstanding but a pleasant quick read with nothing distasteful.	2
6208	A2NI7Y7W3HR5PJ	This book made me gagged. The heroine was idiotic and the hero wasn't much better. Skimmed through the end. I was bored.	0
6209	A6YARH67M2QTK	I liked this book.  The way Ms. Carroll wove around and eventually back to all of the women was very interesting.	3
6210	A1D5XZ5NKK07XE	It was more of a short story. For free, I thought it was great. Very hot. I was rooting for the couple. I liked it!	3
6211	A12PWVAMEVBCXJ	Very graphic and creepy, but very suspenseful well writtenCharacters were well defined..good read, first book I have read by this author, would read more	2
6212	AY19IPKCS98YG	This boom was good. Nothing fancy but good. I did not like the ending. The story just seemed to stop.	3
6213	A1FVZNKIGD2IKF	I prefer inspirational fiction versus a just a clean read.  But this is an excellent story.  I did enjoy it.  Well done.	3
6214	A1DC00T32U26HC	Story line was good. Characters were interesting. Problems with proofreading. Needed more. Hopefully writer will get better with experience. Not sure if I want to read the next book.	1
6215	A95CZC6W4NE58	This is not a review. This is not a review. This is not a reviewThis is not a review. This is not a review. T	3
6216	A2HPI6WJATPSHP	Cute, short, but not up to the earlier Haley Randolph hyjinks.  A bit predictable. We hope the next full novel will get us back to the usual frivolity.	2
6217	A3I9ZQIP32JA2J	Liliana Hart is great.Able to mix danger and hot steamy sex. Dane's ultimate wish for a family comes through but not without its trials.	3
6218	A1SI6RAVVS1YGJ	A very good read if you ask me. It was hard for me to put it down it was that good. Especially if you like hunky aliens :D	3
6219	A2O0ORJQ1DZF5P	It was touching. I enjoyed it. Good beach read. It made me smile. Glad I picked it up. Definitely worth paying for it.	3
6220	A3T1B1X6V4SSSG	This book was well written with lots of suspense and I am looking forward to the next installment in the series.	3
6221	A24BPOL1FQ9N7O	I loved this sweet romance. Nice book to curl up and read. Both the characters were quite plausible. I do recommend it to people who like romantic books.	3
6222	A1R6PNW9YZHRN9	Good story, a little convoluted at times but held my attention.  Worth the time spent reading.  Liked the H & H.	3
6223	A27E0QHGKVI87Q	This was a fun introduction into the Vampire romance genre. I am looking forward to the next book in this series.	3
6224	A18ATM2Z5S0DMF	I liked the novel, despite myself. It's well-structured. The characters are believable enough that I'm willing to suspend my disbelief at some parts of the story.	3
6225	A3361XGKYF17S3	I love these series. I love that it is all coming together for me. I also like that it tells more about the other characters from previous books in series.	3
6226	A2RKS9IDSSSD0Y	Good suspense, good characters, spooky black magic.  It followed a predictable set-up for the unfortunate ending.  Nicely done but it didn't scare me.	2
6227	A31K93JWWNEMAJ	wow, unbelievable, this book, no words, couldnt put it down, cant wait to read part three now. the pen game is sick!	3
6228	A3IC05KV0TWHEE	This is more of a book review or short story than a full length book with loads of typos and spacing problems.	0
6229	AVTOKS08HOEXG	I really enjoyed this story but was dismayed when it ended so abruptly. This is very well written, just too short,  I wanted more!	3
6230	A26GE9ZG68SKIQ	this was a great mystery about Colo and . the small town sheriff.the people in Colo.the area in the mountains.	2
6231	APH0AIQXSJ1CO	What a good story for the young readers. Easy, simple characters and plenty of action written as a child would think.	3
6232	A3MQ1DCPHXBAHY	Seriously....biggest flipping cliffhanger going....Now I have to wait for a 4th book...damn it...I need it like NOW...I just read all three books and now have to wait....hurry up....	3
6233	A9UK4LRX35YTP	Although this book was fair it really lacked wow factors. I wouldn't read it again nor recommend it to friends. Just not enough good details or drama involved.	1
6234	A2HKBKYXKBVWLB	The very strangeness, buried in a comic book framework and teenage fantasy, kept me through the end.  And, damned if I won't get the next in the series.	3
6235	A1BS33VQK5QA76	Not much of a story line.  I was hoping for some romance.  Not this book.  It is down and dirty.  Very short story.	1
6236	A2Z8A1W957DXRU	This is a tale of a strong woman trying to make her way in a tough town during a tough time in history.	3
6237	APH0AIQXSJ1CO	A good story, well written. At first I thought it was impractical but then I thought of their ages and the Times. Things were so different then.	3
6238	A29LNSJ73MQCB2	Everyone deserves a second chance.  Only God can show us the way.  It was inspirational to do things to help others.	3
6239	AJRYPPA566O8I	This is a really short story but is still worth taking the time to read it.  Fate places the main part of the story.	3
6240	A2W225KVGR9EYT	I love the idea of this book. I really enjoyed the story and characters. Feel good book that I would recommend to others.	3
6241	A1PV0M814NH25H	It started out as intersting but something about lost my interest-it seemed nt to be a good read for me	1
6242	A3QJY01AFZXROT	Curvy girls do it better than this short story and that is a certainty that is beyond question to me.	2
6243	A1RQ3SORDKFMWP	This story was short but sweet, big girls need double the love. Three friends making the step into a new life... Sad that it ended so quickly.	3
6244	A20JB693G2RWE8	Fast read. Nice descriptions of Northern Italy. Very spellbinding and  full of suspense. The author does a great job on character development.	3

6247	A1120M9ZK2U3FQ	This book gives a brief but concise history of Alcatraz. Not knowing much about Alcatraz when I bought this book, I found it very interesting and informative.	3
6248	A32UDZXVDJ2DA5	I did not finish this book.  She had too many sexy thoughts about Eric too soon.  I'm not interested in her sex life. Sorry!!	1
6249	A2N7RAPXAB7NK8	I liked the twist of the curse. Especially enjoyed learning more about the medallions. I hope w/Allison having her own series she's not in the next one, girl annoys me.	3
6250	A3CQ5980OVK9GQ	This was good but I have to remind you that it's part one and not a complete story.  It's like a really good introduction to a good story.	2
6251	AQIYMF4X90D8E	Probably for us on senior age,putting decal on your kindle make it looks cheap..more beautiful to look at your kindle without decal..	2
6252	ASD9MWPTD49XO	I really enjoyed how this book explained David's POV and feelings towards Trina. It makes little pieces from the other book fall into place more.	3

6254	A1CAOMN19AZ5KQ	Couldnt  picture the storyline or the characters. Was a disappointment to me. dont recommend it for anyone who likes romance.	0
6255	A3M0TSAQVQC4PY	there were things I liked...but I found the characters too weak, and the story unimaginative. immature characters for their disciplines. no go for me. sorry	1
6256	AGYT51DKZOMA3	This is a sweet, clean romance. It is a perfect little pick-me-up for a rainy (or snowy) day. Definitely recommended.	3
6257	A3FWCXZ2XH6VRA	I thought that this was a great book, I never would have thought that you could grow so much from scraps that I usually throw away	2
6258	AGH8VQORB0UYG	The writing was good but I just did not care at the end what happened to any of them. Somehow I did not connect with any of the characters.	2
6259	A1IBW2RNY9EV2F	I've read most of the Big Girl series and I love each one. This one will make you squirm with desire for Jadinda's hot men.	3

6264	AVTJCMUL5478B	&#34;Confusing and squirming this book is about one man and his attempt at a new life and one girl and her attempt at real life&#34;	1
6265	AYC5H9B2U34VH	This 2nd book crosses over into a more mature form of world buildings.  The characters and the story grow.  The magic remains.  Good read and a series I will follow.	3
6266	A20GMLUOX7ZOXO	Well...I couldn't even make it past the first chapter. I think that right there sums up my review. It will be deleted from my kindle tonight.	0

6269	AGBTOPUDUDU2X	This is a rich, deep purple and the texture is smooth to the touch. It makes the Kindle a comfortable gadget to hold.	3

6271	A1QZC7BPG62BIX	I think this book could have been better if it was longer. It ended to quickly and I wasn't impressed by it either, but it was alright.	2

6275	A34F3MR5KGJ3IS	This book had some useful tips, but I thought it could have used a little more elaboration in a step by step format.	3
6276	A2L8LN488LD63Z	I like the way they are writing and keep you  wanting to know what will happen nextand is very sexy.i would recommend this book.	3
6277	A31YF5VDY5XD0D	Interesting start to a series. Being the first book, a lot of time was devoted to establishing the basic premise. I am certainly interested in checking out the next tale.	2
6278	AX7ZRV05WPVK2	I like this. It's a nice read.  The length is perfect. The plot is intriguing. I would recommend it.  This was an unexpected release, but I cannot complain.	3

6284	A3GN2Y68DRXUNX	This book does just what it says and gives excerpts on upcoming books.  So if you want the dope and like to read excerpt read this one.	3
6285	ASMHONA3A1BM6	I didn't know what to really expect from this book, but was pleasantly surprised. Jace and Adrienne make a perfect couple. Looking forward to Troys book.	3
6286	A35T2KRRW321WA	Nice read.  Want more from this writer, perhaps more about this character and her adventures.  Or some other stories that would mine the author's creativity.	3
6287	A2S9BHNJ3RQXAM	I liked it. It's  a quick read, entertaining, not outstanding but good for a  beach read. I liked the male POV.	3
6288	A1UJX94LXJAGSZ	Nothing wrote that had proof....I rely on my probiotic my Dr. recommended, and have found they work and keep the good and bad bacteria even in my body.	0
6289	A1MYGD5LT2LB9Q	Good short scenes. Made me want to read some of the books completely. I will try to find them and finish the whole story.	3

6294	A2Y9A8RR4CAQIX	I found this book helpful. I believe it echoes what is on the website, but it is nice to have it in Kindle format.	3
6295	AABXUSGGXUY1Q	This was an exciting short read. I was slightly disappointed that I got through it so quickly, but it was certainly a sexy, heart pounding little read! Well worth it!	3
6296	A1Z7P2F240R0IX	This was OK to read and did not like the 2nd book as well as the first one.  It arrived promptly to my kindle and downloaded without any problems.	3
6297	A2UC5S4570U3WB	Good buy. The book teaches children to try new and as a mother of a five and six year old that's an amazing quality.	3
6298	A3L5PG57UDUAK2	Boring and rehash of old generic information . No new ground broken and no new ideas . Not worth the 12 seconds to download it ..	0
6299	AAOA3WLON3GKX	I would say that this book was okay. I did enjoy it but there wasn't any point of the story that I was dying to know what happened next.	2

6304	A38DIX88M5T94P	I have tried to complete the series but I just can't. Let this stuff go and move onto another group	1
6305	A5K88OM7E6WVK	Definitely worth a read, for a more mature audience. Sexual situations/scenes and strong language do occur.	3
6306	A34P1U8WDSUNE4	Although this book did describe the fundamental ways of investing and acquiring gold, it was worthless for specifically hands on how to actually do so for an amateur.	0

6308	AQVURMQUQ8LTQ	I like short stories & this one was nice even though as an avid reader I saw the end coming.	3
6309	A9I2OPQT76SPD	something was missing...not sure what. it was good, although the ending was somewhat boring it wasn't bad. Corbin was asking for the drama that Angel gave him!!!	3

6311	A3M90JEDM7UFWN	This book started out slow but got really interesting about half way through. Overall a good book. Looking forward to book 2!	3
6312	A1X5UBDD56LWK4	This book was hard for me to finish.  The dialogue really bothered me....former mob members do not call each other knuckleheads.  Definitely wouldn't recommend.	2

6315	AVGYENZU56KBR	The heroine was very young sounding and the hero seemed not much older. The hero's brother was self-involved and the whole story seemed juvenile to me.	1
6316	A7QN3YS1SUO7G	A great historical romantic read.  The characters are likable and the story line flows smoothly.  I would recommend this book.	3

6323	A2QM3AUSBDJD87	Some good stories, some not so great. Decent editing, but it still needs some work. All in all, it was an enjoyable read for the price.	2

6337	A142248AL6S2TN	This wasn't what I thought it would be but I found it interesting just the same. These recipes are from novels.	3

6399	A3I6EHLEXK7IZ	It's ok but just so very short. It was written ok but a little too precise. I don't really recommend this one	1
6400	A11DMJCWJP9FWM	Sorry I paid even 99cents for it.  Not written well, an totally unbelievable that this lady claims to have a following that subscribes to this garbage.	0

6408	A3RENNB7Z03JC1	The best I could say is its ok. It is one of those that have multiple books that follow and thats not for me.	2
6409	A1WEAZL39O7NXE	This was an OK read -- nothing stands out, for or against. I wanted an introduction to this author's style and I guess this book supplied that.  Just OK.	2
6410	A1PSGA348YRV67	I understood it was a short story going in, but was unhappy to see that it was only a tease, ending in a cliffhanger.	2
6411	A2ROTO9NBWG1VO	This was a nice story.  I thought it could have been longer - had the storyline and characters develop a bit more.  For a shorter story, it was adequate.	2
6412	A14HVPJ42FZKY9	I read this with anticipation of what it would be about but I found out in the end that was very inspirational.	3
6413	A1C09CP4I906HS	I am mentally drained,emotionally drained and wet. Very thought provoking. Mr.  Hildreth if the other books are the same I will be sending you my medical bills.	3

6427	A14KZDI7FYTDC	Love the story line. Lots of twist and unexpected turns. Filled with emotion you can feel. Keep tissue in hand. Expect to laugh as well.	3

6429	A27DIYVQ2K8LV8	I found this book easy to follow and read with excellent information for anyone thinking of making their own soap. The pictures really help also!	3
6430	A3VH9WGKFM1498	This was a little predictable and the heroine was totally unbelievable, but I enjoyed the book anyway.  It was mindless entertainment which is pretty much what I was looking for.	3

6437	A1IZL5SLE1V0SE	Why don't you have the series all rated at one time.  It would make it a lot easier and stops wasting time.	2

6449	A2DSSNXD4TQV7E	"My son is just getting the hang of this ""reading on your own"" thing. He said that it was just okay."	2
6450	A2PXCT34AREBMB	I just couldn't get into it. Descriptions of things and people rather than telling a story. Just my take on it. Hopefully, others will feel differently.	0
6451	AJV5S21Y332D1	as was already stated, sophmoric, trite, poorly writen and i could go on and on. this book should be in the youth religon section.	0

6467	A3JON85DZIJSZ3	It was a fun read! I enjoyed the two main characters - although if one character was what he was - how could he be held back kinda confused me	3
6468	A2I917RSGPV9FG	This could have been so much better without all the typos and lack of punctuation. That definitely took away from the story. And the ending...really?	3

6478	A31GMWA73W17SP	I truly enjoyed this book. Who wouldn't love Sam? I also liked Kate and how strong she was. I would definitely read more by Kristine Raymond.	3

6480	A1AXO09NADF67V	Like other reviewers have stated, this book combines Lovecraftian type horror with elements of a Dr. Who/Sherlock Holmes character. I liked it.	3
6481	A1WIGLDJ491TXW	I can't remember anything about this book, so it must have been very forgettable and a complete waste of time and money	0

6486	A35LBI5EE15ETV	Held your intersest throught out, building sympathy nicely for George.  I was disturbed at the ending and the futillity of his plight.  Wondering if that was the intention?	3
6487	A1E3WRORCM6J5Y	I never read this because I always buy whatever David Baldacci writes.  Buy the book, not the preview.  You won't be sorry.	2
6488	AO95THJYTJINX	Not much I can say about this book.  It was just okay for me. I did like how the dad stepped up to the plate but that was about it.	2
6489	ARYSM38RKE8DP	This book is not a good book, lacks in many ways.  There is no recipes, specific instructions. Don't waste your time.	0

6494	A2YOYGGXZCSZ30	Very enjoyable read.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes an easy, relaxing story. My first Heather Huffman novel, but not my last.	2
6495	A3ENKLDWAQVXUV	The book is an ok read.  The ending is lame -as mentioned before - it caters to today's secular world, and doesn't reflect our Catholic teaching.	1
6496	AC9R8QC9WDKUK	A nice short story and follow-up on characters and events from earlier book Encrypted. Good afternoon reading in wait for Decrypted!	3
6497	A3782GOE1V3FPM	The length abused the concept of the story but got it and it was ok while it lasted. Too Short	2

6506	A2Y88OEOT5RTCX	The story had potential.  The editing was so poor, however, that it was hard to get through the story.  Better luck on the next one!	1

6508	A18YNK2J98LOC3	Great story,just move too fast	2

6510	A23J874HKS64VY	It was okay. Decently written. But it had little to no character development. It's like a mini written version of a lifetime movie.	2
6511	APICBIHJAC4BN	I love the relationships (both functional and dysfunctional) Letty has developed.  As a therapist, I wish my life was 1/2 as exciting as hers!	3
6512	A279TEHTOK4Z75	This was quick and easy to read due to its predictable simplicity.  It didn't keep me awake at night, for sure!	2

6524	A6NFUENUB0P7M	Quick paced and simple. A little unbelievable at times but hey its based on Pride and Prejudice so you know what your gonna get	3
6525	AW622MS6TSD4R	A very Bad Mistake if you buy this book.  It's this kind of writing that gives independent and self-published authors a bad name.  Stay a way, stay far away.	0
6526	A5IDWDZ2L1LA	This was a nice short story. More of a teaser, really. But it was nice to read the back story on Tod.	3
6527	A3L6DUXY4NWX3P	My 3 year old loves this one. It is a quick and easy book to read that he wants me to re-read a bunch.	2
6528	A2Y0CH8FAKNR8J	Not too bad some good action.there was too much back and forth between the characters.alot of sexual talk that never amounted to much.	1
6529	A1ZV5JOMVS74J0	I was a little disappointed in this book.  It seemed like the plot went way to fast, like I started the book and it was over.	1
6530	A3SQD3Y7EPYEUQ	yet again this wonderful author has made another great book I've yet to read one that was bad such a good story!	3
6531	A38VMA5KSPOZ6Z	quick & easy read. good for beach or airplane. not much substance, tho.i don't understand why reviews have word limits.	2
6532	A1BLAF4M1Q0NXF	Not a bad effort. Some editing issues but nothing I couldn't plow through. Not sure I'll read the next book but this one kept my interest.	3

6534	A1E408D9QFMHT9	I started out really eager to read this book.....it got a bit weird, but it's still an interesting read, guess I'm not that into &#34;mystical&#34; things.	2

6538	A1D1GP1B7UH5NE	This was way to short, once I got started it was over. I hope the next book is longer, can't wait to find out what happens with the crew.	3
6539	A2NOOGV8OVZ1WX	I really enjoy Ms. Roth's writing style. The heroes are hot and alpha, the heroines are strong and snarky. I'm looking forward to more of the series.	3
6540	A2LU392V0T5MRC	This story goes a mile a minute. Interesting characters and a real feel of Hawaii. Penny/Pali engages you right from the start.	3

6542	ABN07FZM1HNYF	This is OK especially if you like a lot of unnecessary detail about sex. I would not read more of this stuff tho.	2
6543	A1LUO5QUM7MT4U	Choose this set only if you have time to read because you won't want to put it down. Even though I know Jane Eyre... it kept me hooked.	3
6544	AYNF3V6M4BBJ3	I really enjoyed this book.  Read it in one sitting.  It was fast paced, concise & easy to follow, looking forward to the sequels.	3
6545	A329S1E12X1M45	Basic info about the strategy. It is more about money management than a strategy book. The strategy is not very clear in my opinion. Not recommend for experienced traders.	2
6546	ABN24X1GXXG3F	I enjoyed the unusual twists and turns of this book. Very entertaining. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.	3

6548	A3HQA1A25EPELT	I found it was a sweet story but predictable, tho the sex scenes left me wanting.  Still worth reading for the most part.	2
6549	A2X7AJ4YIBEGHN	Action packed and well paced. Interesting story line. Love the main character and some of the minor characters. Good quick read.	3
6550	A3G62MZBBRDQXZ	It just didn't delve into the paranormal as much as it looked like it would. The story was simple & easy.	1
6551	A21PC35SNYXRBX	Finished the book in one setting couldn't, put it down. The plot was good and the ending was a surprise. Well done.	3
6552	A25KH7EPKLAJUX	Coocaine Princess was okay. But not what I expected. Cannot wait for part 2. Hoping it's more action in that then part one. But Rio keep doing what you doing.	3
6553	A1PH97IIAG6IX0	Good thing the book wasn't too long or I might have jumped to the last chapter.  Some good love scenes.	2
6554	A17J3U3XOZ5A4B	This book wasn't my style.  I saw all the great reviews so I got it and started reading.  I just could barely get through the first chapter.... Sorry	1

6558	A2FNPK1B7H5RTG	Good story and a nice evening's read.	3
6559	A1KZ3GZL595YAR	It is like a five minute report done by third grader- no depth, no analysis- absolutely a boring recitation of newspaper articles	0
6560	A1H99QQB3L2K79	I really enjoyed this book.  I love when the characters struggle in a new relationship....the sparks fly and they try to fight it.  Good read.....	3

6563	A223T998MPEEWS	A very good short reading book kept your interest through out the whole thing the  more you read it you wanted it not to end	3
6564	A3LOOA3ECIBI2Q	A fast pace novel about archeology and a good subject that is still much debated. Somewhat like H Rider Haggard SHE.	3
6565	A10Y597K071WTQ	It's kind of funny how love goes just when you think you have it all, it's not want you really want after all.	2
6566	A1MABOUDKTRA23	I love reading world war 11 novels . berlin Calling is  up there with the best. Takes the reader back as if you were really there	3
6567	A3VOLMPH9OAIU4	Sad and spooky all at the same time. You feel so bad for our young hero. I am definitely empathic with her.	3
6568	A3P69TSIOTX8CD	As usual the senior sleuths get themselves in one mix up after another. Somehow they always solve the mystery and live on to do it again	3
6569	A1UZRBGETXNAIY	I'm sure many would really enjoy this book but for me it was too violent, with too much course language and a bit too weird.	2
6570	A13OKXN3F3783H	The only problem with Nutall is the plots are similar.  No romance only bang bang.  It becomes very boring at the end.	2
6571	A3M9PJXTC6H9X2	At first I thought this short story was boring, and the he was a chump. The more I read the more I wanted	3
6572	A69XTW58QLOPB	Stories are ones we've all heard about before but perhaps there is a little bit more you can pull from the stories here. I enjoyed it.	3
6573	A3O5I6G6PRT35D	This was definitely a good read.  Funny as well. Yes I would like to recommend this to others who enjoy a good love story with a fairytale ending.	2
6574	A1DX9PS0UN7EHY	Very cute, very charming, very uplifting, very nice... What else can I possibly say here? If you are into the spirit of Christmas.	3
6575	A1E9OASPHOHDYE	Enjoyed the story, the book was well written.	3
6576	A2KL66N2SIKX7A	A great 2nd book! This book kept me wanting more. Can't wait to see what comes next in the series	3
6577	A3HC0NLQ5G7J4Z	Enjoyed the story, but it really needs some serious editing.  Felt like they were in a hurry to get it published and skipped/skimmed over way too many typos.	3
6578	A1QGZRRHYS0WJ6	Too short.  Romantic scenes needed to be longer.  I couldn't quite get in to it because it went too fast..	2
6579	AY304RNZBJ3Z	Certainly not the best book I have read. A little disjointed it seems. Have read some of Yoder that I really liked.	2
6580	A3I0OTHCHCXEMM	"Wow! I guess you could say this was based on ""Heaven won't have me and Hell is afraid I'll take over"". What a fun read.  Get this one..."	3
6581	A30GQ39G21VU08	Learned some good information.  It was interesting to get a new perspective on relationships.  The author is humorous and even sarcastic at times which made the book fun to read.	3
6582	A3QCNAU9HTHBRU	Enjoyed this book. Gave me a lot to think about. Would highly recommend this book. A lot of food for thought.	3
6583	A14SUTO1JKUSBW	I finished this book in record time, I like the characters and the story line is full of entertainment and romance.	3
6584	A1SGRB793VZ6VJ	I found this to be a very boring book and didn't finish it after reading 4 chapters.  The Monk was creepy!	1
6585	A2EJMPS57PVMDS	I just finished #2 and it's very good. It's a great storyline and I look forward to reading number 3.	3
6586	A2XECM9DKJ2DSH	This is an excellent book that I would recommend to everyone. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat.	3
6587	A2FAD6WDKLYD5N	A quick read for history lovers which provides readers a sense of what conflicts Sitting Bull and his people endured.	3
6588	A299F9M0R8R8ZS	I have all three books  and I'm still reading them simultaneously . The jury is still out  for this story	2
6589	A2AFB6MIGO37ZR	2.5 stars. It is better than most free books I've encountered. I don't feel like I wasted my time but it definitely could have been better-spent.	2
6590	A3QDININACB21V	The analogy of goals and tasks to a road trip was very helpful in visualizing how to develop an effective plan including a detailed to-do list.	3
6591	A1BF2MEQ10NP06	It was a really good series. I came across this series looking for a new series of books. It really is such a good story about vampires, werewolves and witches.	3
6592	AJZISE2EVBIEK	Need to resd this series....want the next book	3
6593	AAMEDYMK9IO8	Through the use of similes and metaphors, the author tells a wondrous tale. Simple yet complex, it holds one's attention in a very short space of time.	3
6594	A3AUMIC3SO66OL	This was a good story, but I wished for more character development. Great setting for A Christmas story. Didn't hate it and didn't love it.	2
6595	A29PI3W91Y7IZN	...And a central love story to boot.  The Redemption series continues to intrigue with unexpected twists and turns .  I look forward to reading the next installment.	3
6596	A1SOEVVJ8THYTX	Twists and turns never know what is next. Williams thrillers fantastic reading. Can't wait to read next book in series. Excellent.	3
6597	A2QV424NAKZCZZ	Josh and Genie are great together. They managed to work out the differences that could have had an impact on their relationship and cause a permanent impasse. Enjoyable series!	3
6598	A3P44N4J5KBL8D	Was a good love story, although didn't feel real or that it could be real. Wouldn't really recommend it to others but I did enjoy it.	3
6599	A1YQ4CZ5XEC11P	short free story! I thought it was rather forward on the way that they interact, but that is the point of a short novella I believe.	2
6600	A2ZVB1IL012A79	It was an okay read.  It had a good story and some interesting characters.  It scratched my itch at the time when I needed something to read.	2
6601	A11E16L5QK8HFM	It is what it is - and the twists are much appreciated.  Very creative!  Makes you want to write one up yourself!	3
6602	A3QXRC3LSY6Y2D	A free book and 10 minutes of my life I will never get back. nothing more to say, i just needed more words for the post.	0
6603	A2410SALE76JZH	This book was a really fun read.  I'm not an Austen Addict, but it was still an enjoyable read - I would recommend.	3
6604	AZBE5NTOXGSZ	Interesting take on the paranormal.  I enjoyed the book but, wish the ending could have included a little more info.  Seemed to end a little too abruptly for me.	2
6605	A1N5SXOJUJGI6A	"I'm sorry to say, but this ""book"" is horrible! I know it's supposed to be by cats. But if I were a cat, I'd be insulted."	0
6606	AIXRHWJ7Z1M6W	There were do many characters introduced at random times in the book, and the plot was very confusing and hard to follow.	2
6607	AHTOZIG6WIKQ3	Liked it, but hardest thing was to figure out which book came first.  A good fantasy read and I got into the entire series and enjoyed them all.	3
6608	AF82NHBG7X4PG	I never thought that this book would make me laugh out loud...but it did.  I am laughing while I'm writing this review. very funny.	3
6609	A18Z5XACCNMUVE	This collection of monster and paranormal reports were fascinating. Many of them I'd never heard before. They certainly satisfied the armchair researcher in me.	3
6610	AIQWMQ4JWKZ3T	Just strange from beginning to end. Very short, 30 minute read, tops. But so unbelievable it makes the female appear stupid.	2
6611	A2CO6YKJ92948A	I never knew how easy it was to make hummus before this book. good alternative to the junk food that is killing us.	3
6612	A315QOOH61E1UK	I'm looking forward to part two of circles. The ending has me wanting more! Hope Sasha starts speaking up for herself, so she can finally be happy!	3
6613	A39BCMFV33BMPG	I wanted something that I can use to get started on my new Kindle. Not a programmer so this was perfect as a beginner's guide.	2
6614	A2LLWECSU8BG76	The story did not jump out at me.  I wasn't tempted to purchase the next book in the series.  The story line moved too slowly.	2
6615	A1U0KEY6Q1G1BF	I want more of this. The world was fascinating. The characters wonderfully flawed and powerful. Hopefully the next installment is a full length novel.	3
6616	A2KX54XAH5YGAW	Was a little hard to read. Never really got the story line and was confused with the ending.  Gave three stars	2
6617	A1JRQ2J7QYHM2S	Another good book in this series with a surprise find in it... Can't wait for the next one as I didn't realize there was going to be a book 4...Yay!	3
6618	A2KYVN6VTUYU4P	Great Spy novel. The story revolves around the Al-Qaeda and the damage they are planning to ensure on Washington. The CIA gets involved on a International	3

6620	AZD74VERJY2LP	This book was heartbreaking to read all the things she went through and how she was able to have light and courage to move through that dark hole to happiness.	3
6621	A2OK24SNRJWBKG	This was a very well written short story.  God is always around us and always using someone to show us we are never alone.	3
6622	A3T91UNHFG36UV	Part two ended up being much better then the first the story is getting more interesting and flows better. It makes me want to continue on...	3
6623	A3THAEKDPJ0ZT8	This series is so cute. I love it! Gabi and Terrance's stories continues and it has you captured from the beginning until the end.	3
6624	A2YW7AX0TRLNFC	Unfortunately I did not care very much for this book. Nothing against the author, I'm sure they have plenty of fans.	1
6625	AGI3SFKLQWGQT	It's a good start.  Characters are stock with no real development, but skewing suburban mores is interesting.  Might read the next one.	2
6626	A3H6ODLLISRJ77	There was no point to this book whatsoever!  I didn't get it at all.  I guess you have to be a CAT lover to understand.	0
6627	A14V90HRZPE58E	The plot is simple but interesting.  It's something that you can relax and read - no muss, no fuss.  Just easy to read	2
6628	ARO76WPN7EQDK	It is a quick read but you will miss the real story if you.  Please take the time to enjoy the ending.	3
6629	A5V9K2ZQNRME2	I didn't expect much considering the simplistic cover, but I was very impressed by this little book. Lots of practical advice for getting your life more organized.	3
6630	A1XO7OB28AW388	this so called book was a total waste of time--a group of cookbooks with a few recipes from each-- and not very good recipes at that--nothing new-nothing inspiring	0
6631	A2MWANBR1LURFL	Same as the other books of this series, all very well written, a page turner and very entertaining for sure.	3
6632	A3U5ODTF61P9S	I LIKED TIS BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL THAT ENJOY PARANORMAL BOOKS, THE AUTHOR HAS OTHER MORE OUTSTANDING BOOKS THAT I ENJOY MORE	3
6633	A3TC60MGLW1I76	These are three good romantic stories. Marie Force is an excellent writer and her books are always enjoyable. I will definitely buy more in the Gansett Island series.	3
6634	AON08NVBQKMV8	This is a serial, so, the portion I've recieved so far, I've enjoyed.  I was unsure of the concept of a serial, but find that I enjoy them.	3
6635	A2DTGKN2KMYJO5	I didn't realise it was such a short story, but it was quick and hot and done. Hopefully they pop up in future story lines?	2
6636	A1DBCUSELB970S	Whilst I am not against same sex relations, it is not something I enjoy reading about.  Not my type of book at all.	1
6637	A7YLDDB1MZP8H	This book was a nice short quick read. It did engage the reader in the life of the characters. It is such a game such things happen.	3
6638	A3KSHVUN6WDQCM	I really liked the beginning and was interested in the relationship dynamic. I was 78% into it and just gave up. It became a bore and a soap opera.	1
6639	AXOAQUZYHDGIF	This book has some amusing dialogue & is a fun read.	3
6640	A2MPOFQ5AJKUMS	I loved this book it was a good read.Adeline and Jordan make a good couple. I read the book in no time it keep me interested	3

6643	A1NFM82LE9NHHH	Enjoyed reading. It was different with a love story mixed within a spy thriller mystery. Natasha learns with Gods help what He wants for her.	3
6644	A1VV5AL3WKVOF0	This is a short story that introduces Goldie Locke and the Were Bears series.  It is a good quick read.	3
6645	A312IBEO4B5RGQ	short story that was a nice thriller. would recommend to those that enjoy something sinister. loved the ending and made me wish for more to read.	2
6646	A1N5S11NU892G2	I thought the character was shallow and silly...the characters were predictible and uninteresting. I felt the book was a ripoff of the Stephanie Plum series without the good writing.	1
6647	A6ZXPTYEGM5V5	I am use to reading books that this just wasn't enough for me. it was good but I was not as fulfilled with her other works.	2
6648	A3IZU63H3RBN22	this was not as good as I thought it would be, too short and I got the plot right off and too light reading.	2
6649	A3GMIHZWDI0TE	This was labled as erotica but I disagree. I have read more erotic secenes in books that were just labled romance. The story didn't hook me either.	0
6650	A1SERMB4JPASY3	Good mystery and suspense.  I will definitely read another John A. A. Logan book.  Thomas Ford did a great job of surviving!!!	3
6651	APSJY7O3R5HNL	Short and steamy. I love butchies and here's a hot one. Way too short though. It was about a third the length it could have been.	3
6652	A2P84HVL9PSRVO	Darlng little story of mishaps.  The good Doctor had sense to see that this woman was made for him, and that the baby was a wonderful surprise.	3
6653	A20GZGFPH2D97U	Weak and nonsensical story, very sophomoric and a waste of time.	1
6654	A34YTW02Q47WU5	I received this book in exchange for my honest review. This romantic was exciting and heart-pumping, but a little too scandalous for me.	3
6655	A1DDS2IJLCGHVO	It is nice to see the information in a simple, easy to read and understand format. Thank you for the info.	3
6656	A30PF6B5WF3V0A	Yes - I really like this author!  This book holds your interest, stays true to the biker genre, smexy scenes and a hot alpha male!  More please....	3
6657	A1P09AV1JDP7UQ	The black cover looks nice and has a interesting texture.  The elastic strap keeps it closed, yet is easy to remove.	3
6658	A12RCE3OS1KFG9	Another short story that leads you on and keeps you hanging wanting to know what comes next. Still should have put them all in one book.	2
6659	A12JXPO3XTR99L	A great read that I think surpassed the first in this series! I loved it!!! A great easy read that had me laughing out loud at times! Loved it!	3

6661	A1FV0XY1YEJRS7	Each story is uplifting.  Maybe a little on the light side, but just the sort of thing to restore your faith in humanity.	2
6662	A35CR3WOCOZXTC	Needed more. Left a lot out. Bored me to death. I am not much of a talker am only posting this so that others don't wast their time.	1
6663	ATS98RUVZ918R	Lots of stories from original series by Hugh Howry. Since I have the Wool Series...	2
6664	A2QKVFPLV8QXLJ	Kate Perry has done it again. Another cute story. I gave this one 4 stars because I thought it was tough to follow at times.	3
6665	A1GYBQO81BUU0	I thought this story was very interesting , how an angry man can become a wonderful person with a lot of passion. How one woman can help him.	3
6666	AVO8UB9IDYW1I	I enjoyed this book, as I did the rest of the series. It's fairly light reading, and a good paranormal romance.	3
6667	A14IAK9WY4HEOX	Hope the author has many more for his readers. It's entertaining, visualizing characters grow and mature, through stories, for all to enjoy.	3
6668	A297L1QSYKT19	The second book in the Wedding Series. I love Historical romances and this was a delight. It was fun, romantic and an easy read.	3
6669	AR7KGLYJC24U7	Yep. I read this in one night. It's a fast read, and takes a bit to realize how it fits in with the Creed stories. Loved it.	3
6670	A116B8VV6DLZMX	Because I'm never disappointed!  Try him, you'll like him.  He loves America, hates the bad guy and takes you along for the ride.  Easy interesting read.	3
6671	A1ISWZLDJIVFJQ	This book was an easy read for me. Age range would be 18 to 60. Or anyone that's into a good mystery. Enjoy!	3
6672	A1FDVCPRLQY0G5	Tina Folsom is one of my favorite writers and she did a great job with these 2 books too !!	3

6676	A37FF9L9LILMXG	I loved the story but I wish it was longer. Loved both hero and heroine.  Wish I known more about their friends and family. Don't expect any epilogue.	2
6677	A1SZ3MY91B3ET0	If she was smart enough to be scientist before how can she so dumb after? Author has lots of room to improve	2

6681	A2TNOITGFCSHHW	Super Cute love story!! A good and fast read but worth the time. If you like the sappy love stories this one is for you!!!	3
6682	AOWH607EK3VR7	What a read! The twist is what kept me from 5 stars.. I saw that coming also didn't like the coincidence of the accused.. Too many..  Bf? Bf? What?	3
6683	A37TON7WI87V3P	Ugh!! The story took forever to get to the point. There twist and turns that didn't make any sense  I was literally bored and skim through most of it.	0
6684	A25QGSC5CE9K35	Good book, it could do with some editing for mistakes.  I'll be looking for the next one.	2
6685	A35YL8SQIKL0M8	This book was cute - like watching a Christmas Hallmark Movie.  Perfect reading before bedtime.  Short and sweet.  Can't wait until next book comes out hopefully shortly.	3
6686	A29F0VUUX86O9W	The books in the series are enjoyable, they are a continuation so you really have to read all three of the sisters books.	3

6691	A33H2FIN6KTV1T	Mixed feelings on this book. Long and sometimes rambling, the ending will really get to you.  Editing was pretty bad on the last half.	3
6692	A1UJ4A5M6GL15C	This book was totally unexpected...I loved it and cannot wait to read more from T. Renee Fike. I'm happy I took a chance on it!	3

6694	A2OKY0MOGJAUDT	Having read other books by Terry Anne browning it was just as excellent as all of her other books. I can't wait for any of her new books	3

6702	A3CEI5ICKQ55SB	These short stories are reminiscent of a hairy Buffy the Vampire Slayer. If you enjoy a quick, not so serious monster story, these are for you.	3
6703	AYHPKLHKF8FHW	"Usually love hockey romance but this was on ""ok"" for me.  Nothing about it sticks out in my mind.  It was a suggestion therefore I read it."	1
6704	A1WU0404CN59KA	Just another quick read, not much substance and a little unbelieveable.  Good for the long airplane ride or the rainy afternoon.	2
6705	A1I3CP8FQTLR8	Cute story that encourages kids to read and visit the library. Not a book that the kids will want read repeatedly though.	2
6706	A2B9C3FMYW18UN	I really enjoyed this book. This was a short story. The characters were interesting and the story line  was ok.	2
6707	A1TWV867HVZ60	its a step above the basic romance books.  She is a jockey and he is the owner of the horse..  take it from there....	2
6708	A2T3GS44NDPJX4	This book is a wonderful short read that let's us know that you don't have to be perfect to be loved or to love chocolate	3
6709	ATC75BZ5UFV64	Liked the book but some references were a bit strange as they were British. Good characterizations that entertained the book moved along at a fast pace	2
6710	AOC7KDO9G4YC6	After reading this book I will not be going on any camping trips.  I call out a lot but now will think twice before I go again.	3
6711	A2M6LL8Z8UTD3H	This story was a bit predictable and frustrating at times but it was an ok read, more for the romantic I think	2
6712	A2992YYJLV7Q1V	Some of the box set was very good and some of it I had to make myself read.  Cookbook is okay	3
6713	A3U8TDJLOPTL41	The combination of facts in small, easy to digest bites and NASA photos give the reader a good general knowledge base from which to build.	3
6714	ANYFFX3SIZ57U	This was a good story, but at times it just drug on with too much detail.  It was an interesting look at a time when living was a bit different.	3
6715	A12JXPO3XTR99L	A sweet, sometimes hot, story about how love conquers all! I enjoyed it very much and am looking forward to more about this small town!	3
6716	A576L6YAOW6IP	I found the story too steeped in the mundane activities of day-to-day life.This book had so much potential.	0
6717	AW177X2KAGX6C	This wasn't exactly what I expected when I purchased it, but turned out to be a very nice read.  History mixed in with motivation and very easy to read.	3
6718	A2NMG3C1OFRG3H	Good read! Kept me turning the pages! Can't wait to see what happens next! I'm getting ready to read the next one now!	3
6719	AUO4H68RUYKZ	There is humor, action, romance, heroes and dastardly villains.  I would highly recommend this as a good sci-fi, fantasy read.	3

6721	A1CPC8304XF4UN	I enjoyed the author's writing style, as it was down to earth and honest, with easy to implement suggestions. Nothing necessarily new, but a good reinforcement to keep going.	3
6722	A2FYN49K0BGXV4	I did enjoy Eagle's Lady and I will get sequel.  Story kept turning pages.  I was not ready for ending.	3
6723	AQMJXMCFIE1AJ	I really liked all the books in this series.  I connected with the characters.  I will likely read other books written by Jamie Magee.	3
6724	A10MSMRLNSU8R8	It was a nice story but too short to me. The chain of events just happened too fast.I would have liked to have the story expanded more.	1
6725	A6OJQKM1VSQ0D	Good story but the ending makes me think it was fiction based on things that really may have happened during that time?The Mousetrap	2
6726	APDWQU6TN7XTZ	This is a very good book. I just wish it had a little more to the ending of the story. If felt incomplete. Left me wanting to know more.	3

6728	A1F41IQ78WG7SR	For some reason found this book boring to read. Almost like it was written by several high school students, caching	1
6729	A3ET9B0KU67Z1N	Enjoyed the book, but a lot is left out.  Either the story needs to move forward or left out.  Find a track and stick it out.	3
6730	A6TNFBX1UJYD1	I really enjoyed this book.Lots of action from the beginning, and the characters were quite believable. It seems that all worlds have the same problems: bullies and drugs	3
6731	A2UH7EMPH4GK2L	This certainly sounded like an intriguing novel, but I couldn't get past all the basic grammatical errors (mostly punctuation). A little editing goes a long way.	0
6732	A2HLVYIVU6VJ3X	Very interesting scenario I have read many of books none like this. Two thumbs up loved this book can't wait for the sequel.	3

6746	A2QU72989CEE6L	Good read, was always wondering what was next, I like short stories that don't drag on with nonsense just to feel the time up.	3
6747	A1AHCX8ONTKNSG	I had read the second book first so it was o.k. the book is worth reading the next is better.	3
6748	ALGJUPAK5743P	Very nice recipes and has some pictures too.	3
6749	AI2Y69N3X5RU2	This book was alright I hope that the next one will be better. I was a little disappointed with the way it started but it did get better.	3
6750	A2TWXEO3YM4OAP	I liked this story. I think it would make a good series with all the Marines in it!! This could be a beginner story for a more detailed book.	3
6751	A1HC621PCV32VT	Read all three books. They were funny and romantic. Three different girl's. All become friends. It was a nice mix.	3
6752	A531QY5K7JVXI	This novel was a slog through self pity brightened occasionally by a love story that was again dropped into self pity.  Disappointing	1
6753	A20E6VTQ5713CH	I enjoyed reading it but I think it would make a better forward to the Shadow of the Wind or his other book.	3

6755	AKQI4EWEJI6OV	This was a good book easy read. I definitely would reccommend this book to other readers. Wish the book was a bit longer though but definitely Good book	3
6756	A1PZ2GNF0MQWAO	I totally enjoyed the first three books of this series.  It had a solid plot that had a good flow to it.  The characters are well developed and believable.	3
6757	A5CDWQZ3A75WR	This book was really good, but it was just too short and left a lot to be desired. Definitely worth grabbing though	2
6758	A3LF54M3WVB9ZO	Amusing characters , alpha males and an interesting story. I liked it very much. I wished it was longer and that it had gone into more detail	3
6759	A11Z3F7TXE1D3	This story sucked me in and then bam, it ended. What happens to Paul, Carmen, and all of the others? So frustrated!	2
6760	AJDAPSUP5XA7T	Lots of twist and turns and will keep you guessing. Well written and great characters. A great read one you will enjoy if you like murder mystery. I do recommend.	3

6768	A3HS3KYR9D08MW	This was a pretty good book. There is a great twist near the end but if you haven't read the Last Riders series it won't make sense.	3
6769	A2D8LOWYLOOZX	More like an essay but a sweet non-fiction story of a playful side of Lincoln and Mary Todd you never hear about.	3
6770	A1IIOY9IA47UB1	A delightful story with twists and turns and devious characters.  Well written to keep anyone's interest.  And a statement of hope from the author.  Enjoy the journey.	3
6771	A1FGO2R046GX3E	I like the way you can dive right into the the book and you are pulled into the action.  Great read.	3
6772	AJJH71T4KKHOH	Short story from before the heist. Totally recommend the heist. If you like this, you will really like the full story.	3
6773	A34FGMJ3K5O6GT	Yes it is hot as far as erotic goes but the story was kinda off. I just could not get into the story.	1
6774	A1IR0BQWGOPBAN	It was pretty good but I am unsure if I will read any more of this series. I am on the fence.	3
6775	ADUEVIYMAXPNP	It works as advertised. Best part? its free. Grab it while its free. It could've however been a little faster.	3
6776	A2JWIAF0NYC8CC	...gets you prepared for the upcoming Halloween spooky mindset.  I enjoyed the quick reads/short stories... had time to read one or two each day!  I'd recommend it!	2
6777	A1UCLOKYNCF63J	Being a retired surveillance pilot made me think of many of my past experiences.  I could enjoy reading many more tales in this vein.	3
6778	A360U1PSJTAR8D	Good read but not as compelling as her other novels.  Nonetheless, Laura Jo Phillips writes an engaging story and I look forward to the next Orb quest novels.	3
6779	A1DFVQAXCPK1BA	Adrain and Chloe are hot on the island. I love that the story takes place on an island. Chloe and Adrian are great in the book.	3
6780	A3C1W3PDMQBK7G	Cute and quirky tale of an ordinary man who finds happiness in an odd place.  Very likable characters and not your average &#34;boy meets girl&#34; love story.	3
6781	A2S8E2XN241T8O	A sad and unfortunately sure to be true story about human kind and what could happen in a catastrophic situation. Well done and kind of creepy.	3

6783	A23XP1AZO8C3MS	I haven't finished yet, but am loving it.  Can't wait to see revenge in action. How sweet it will be.	3
6784	A3B7KFKNXNY9UC	I loved this book because of the reality element.  How far would we go to protect those we love?  It's full of suspense and I loved the surprise ending.	3
6785	ASAAR8TQHCQOU	The erotic sex scene was the only part of the story that captures a readers interest in completing this book. I expected more from this author.	2

6787	A1Z21CM7F1EVGV	I was hoping these stories would be scarier. They are really just stories you would tell little kids around a campfire. They were entertaining, but really not so scary.	2
6788	A28REJAM6899K8	Nice storyline. Probably should read the first book to get into this one. It was good and was written well.	2
6789	A2YOKQ47HB9I2X	This was the first book i read by mrs. wallace. Not to much to say about this book.  It was a cheap book.	2
6790	A2JTXMZWF08H91	The book was fun, but at the very end it skips from pg.3757 to 3772, so you miss part of the ending.  Poor work on Kindle's part.	3
6791	A2G6ZM21TMHISG	Very interesting and informative, without being over informing. Don't read if the death of babies upset or distress you. A quick read, it takes just  couple of hours.	2
6792	A3V21UHY7WTWF	Too much work to cut the cakes up.  Some interesting ideas but not ones that I can see someone use,	1
6793	AMZZOCZBEZNQT	It seems to be a somewhat poor adaptation of fifty shades of grey. It started good but quickly went downhill	0
6794	A2PKYXWGORVF1C	I like to read about how people lived in the past, how simplicity and need made every gift more precious	2
6795	A153BZY51YK0F9	Quick read, but enjoyable. I liked how the characters interacted together and thought it was sweet. I'm going to be looking for more from Ciar.	3

6799	AA9R105SRZGIH	I still have questions; however I now have a resource to find other stuff I did not think I needed to know YET! Very helpful will be referring regularly.	3
6800	A2Z7HILLWSTWML	Starts fast and just keeps going. Hand waving face to cool off may be needed for some Cynthia pulls you in quickly and doesn't let up!	3
6801	A3HKWL91PR78Z5	The story was ok.  It was surprising as the story developed.  I am not sure the story is  something you can believe	3
6802	AD1SDJV8H43KR	Bought this so I could read the fairy tales on my own time! Very gruesome, very cool. The illustrations are great, I just want more!	3
6803	A04825912E6ISETX1Z61P	This book felt unfinished, like it was a chapter or two too short. Many of the characters were not flushed out.	3
6804	A3THKDN74XTOSW	This was very interesting. It kept me in suspense and I like that!  Tragic that Melissa must pay for another's sin.	3
6805	A1JVFUGEATZ7BJ	Douglas and Julia are meant for each other great story.Quite enjoyed this story I would recommend. That's all I have to say. Read it.	3

6807	A2KOHFCY43BX98	fast paced page turner.... wasn't as cookie cutter as I first thought.. It had a few twists and turns that didn't keep you guessing but very interested.....	3
6808	A2D2WT8MKDREX6	This storyline was different what I was use to. It was a ok book. Only thing I didn't like the writer was using his wrote in third person.	2
6809	A1SWEDDGMGS362	i just wanted it to keep going on, it was very interesting and a nice fast read for vacation or at the beach.	3
6810	A386GLFIO8OH2	This is a well written, interesting short story, ideal fora person that does not have the time to engage in an800 page book.Billy	3
6811	AX6FSQ5RL8Z5G	Very strange stories. Kept me reading to find out what was next. I needed a change and it was definitely a change.	1
6812	A2A96H9YA1LG7G	Shayne does it yet again. I loved it, maybe a bit more than the first. A great read :-)Check it out ladies &lt;3	3
6813	A2GTE6M079W0ED	This was different. I am very interested in the H's story. The heroine got her man with a little help from our hero.	3
6814	A2CHESQY3BRM67	i don't know what it was exactly what is was but the tone of the book is off from what i thought. i seems a bit dark to me...	0
6815	A1VFZN51SWTO35	Four year old granddaughter loves me t o read from the Kindle.  She likes the stories and think she is really big when it is on the Kindle.	3
6816	A2S9TXVGR9OKV5	Overall I enjoyed this book despite the fact I figured out the guilty party about half way thru.  However it needs copy editing as there are many missing words.	2
6817	A1ZSFVYGK5HLEF	This was the shortest book I have ever read in my life. I wish I would have known that this book and the first were so short!!	2
6818	A1C018S7HGB8X	This was a very good read about the Quaker families up north.  It kept my attention and gave me a insight into the lives of the Quakers.	3
6819	AFLJQ0QM8XN4K	Desde el primer capitulo me di cuenta que era aburrida, predecible y lo peor de todo es que se demaciado  irreal. No me moleste en terminar el libro.	1
6820	A13351DSHQAIT7	Where's the story in this one? I can write a recipe and post it as a short story too and it'd probably be more interesting.	0
6821	APWE1VORBUKJ2	Michele Kallio created a rich detailed story, characters that brought the pages to life. I would recommend this book to all historical fiction fans who like quick, enjoyable reads.	3
6822	A2E7IPJXDSKZ6O	I don't ever try to open this on my kindle because there's too much rigamarole to try to get there.	0
6823	A2KHIAHLR99H5T	Interesting characters, interesting storyline. Well written and fairly romantic. Would like to have heard more about them as a couple and less about the deputy.	1
6824	A3B143RS9OTU6F	"Same story as so many books out now.....mysterious, beautiful billionaire finds ""normal"" girl that he has to have. Okay read"	3
6825	AE6DA37MB0JXP	Always good to continue the series and now getting into the baby boom of Destiny Bay; very cute must reads to continue the series!	3
6826	A3AWZ258YQURW9	Just what I neede to use my new small crock pot. I am not alone and I need to be able to cook small meals and do it conviently.	3
6827	A3AWZ258YQURW9	It had the potential to be really cute and it did have a few moments. But overall it was more suited to a junevile audience.	0
6828	A2CJ68SDUY3OPH	THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SECOND BOOK OF THE BEGINNING OF THE SERIES ANY WAY SHE ENDED UP W/ 6 MEN	2
6829	A32K5H6ZFDAL69	Who in their right mind would ever try to fit a pool ball in their mouth?? But i like how the stories connect.	2
6830	A00463782V7TKAP9EMNL	Two friends become lovers... But it's unclear how long they'll be together and whether or not they're just exploring a new kind of love.	2
6831	A1X3OBS5HQWD62	I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun fast paced and easy to read. I couldn't put it down! You should read it !	3
6832	A23BS90GTA9DX9	this was not her best work. All of her stuff is usually really good, but this was just lower thtn the others. Like it but not enough to read again.	2
6833	A1WIR7SG0CL44Z	Idiotic characters, idiotic plot, not funny like other reviews stated. I was glad to finish the story.  Perhaps it will appeal to someone else, but not worth reading...even for free.	0
6834	A1NDPQQT37PT70	I could not stop reading. Definitely an attention holder.Full of surprises. Interesting character development. Recommend for vacation when one does not have to get up early.	3
6835	A1MATCLBTPWONR	Some parts a little slow, but all in all a pretty good book.  Liked that I couldn't guess the ending before it arrived.  Will proaly read more from this author.	3

6837	AWNGPHL3BUE62	The book was just ok to me. It was slow. That's all I have to say about it. Maybe book 2 will be better	1
6838	AO46WQ0PYLNBD	The three essays were good they had a few laughs in each one. It was just an okay read for me.	2
6839	A1WEAZL39O7NXE	I usually like Liz Fielding's writing.  A couple of the stories in this collection were good and the other two were just OK.  I will continue  buying her books.	2
6840	ARWAB8RQXJ0UI	This was a great read  sex was hot and the characters  were great. The story was believable ,and I  didn't  want the book to end.	3
6841	A3R3GT2CLJQX3X	Reading about Quinton , Tristen, and Delilah this far gone was hard . It felt like there was no hope. It will be a rough road to recovery.	3
6842	A31GMWA73W17SP	A little mystery, a little romance....pretty good story. It was short and no cliffhanger. The characters could have been developed a lot more.	3
6843	A3QGQPGW6PSY46	The first book was better and more exciting. This was a good read but the parts that was exciting ended quickly. Its like it was sorta rushed .	2
6844	AEWBY4QZHF4DM	I enjoyed this book...I like a page turner, something that keeps me second guessing &#34;who dunnit&#34;, without being able to figure it out mid book	3
6845	AY0GKDA8ESYR8	Good story. Finally Alethea found happiness. Let's see we what th next series brings with the Andrade family. Looking forward to the book	3
6846	A204WVOVDE013A	A short but sweet story about a long-term marriage and a nearly equally long-term secret. This is a well-written short.	3
6847	A2S3Y2NXWQRH1I	Really enjoyed this tale of reunion, and intrigued to see other tales from the series. Pretty light reading all round.	3
6848	A3VP9TF94Z8EQE	Good but could have been longer. Nice plot. Different from other vampire stories. Need more  background and more about their lives. But I Will buy others in series.	3
6849	A1MQON8XA1TTIO	I was expecting more than I got. I don't understand why I need to pad my reviews. I've said it all in one sentence.	2
6850	A2B0RNCAQ7S8H5	This book was a decent read. It would have got 4 stars if it had at least some character development.	2
6851	A30UMARRRQR1DD	This book is a gay book not my kind of book. I would like to see better previews written on book.	0
6852	A1KVMGEQ2524Q5	A quick shove to encourage you and a nice little bio on Tesla. Very upbeat, especially if you are trying to make something out of your own ideas.	2
6853	ALOMGLBPLJCW1	The book started off a little slow, but I'm glad I continued reading it. I think with a little more practice this author will be awesome.	3

6856	A25KXSFN7XS0IG	Temple of the Jaguar was a fun easy read.  It was short and I was wishing for more to read.  I will probably buy more of his books.	3
6857	A3CQ5980OVK9GQ	I wouldn't really call this a romance. There isn't any steamy love scenes either. It was an okay book though.	1
6858	A2QZFM38IQ5WTA	Not very realistic no real Adult fiction  more like teen age stuff. It looks like this is all amazon has any more	2
6859	A3R0XZJXJWKAPH	If you can get over the grammar errors, you might enjoy the story. Sweet story except for grammar errors, not edited very well.	0
6860	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This is an interesting take on a fairy tale. I liked the characters. At the end does not end that is because it is only the first book.	3
6861	A316ZL17JISFDB	I don't like to give negative reviews, but I was so disappointed with this book. I couldn't even finish it. Cheesey writing and just overall not well written.	1

6863	A16XJNGXIVCHE3	I enjoyed reading this book. the characters were nice people and I would like to read more in this series	3
6864	A0229119WYOGTKRDOJCQ	Nice little story but it did carry on and on. There was nothing in the story to make me keep turning pages.	2
6865	A1DE9LILYOGSRB	I have always liked this author this is a good stand alone short story in the fantasy genre. i enjoyed it	3
6866	A3BOZ8XE95JTHR	It could have been a great book.  It has everything going for it, family, humor and love.  But it is way too short.	2
6867	A1WLGPSEIE6WYQ	It kept your interest with characters that were full of life and intrigue but sadly left you wanting more of the story	3
6868	A15NZD5WINDQZM	I loved the premise but, the story itself just dragged.  I was hooked in the beginning and then it just became a yawn	2
6869	A1TA5QYECZP1L1	Freaky tale of four friends at a remote cabin getting more than they bargained for from the catch of the day.	2
6870	A3GHQT0DUA5IJF	This book sucked which is surprising for a David weaver book, even though it was .99 I still felt it was a waste of time and money.	0
6871	A18XG8XIGC6AA4	These guys are hot.  If you like a good romance with a hot heartthrob, this is the book for you.	3
6872	A32TBTQLCEXCHT	Good books - just not long enough for a good read. Just as you get interested in them they are done.	2
6873	A1V3250PC11EMQ	I was so into this book,that i didn't see the ending coming,but the cliffhanger crushed me.When or is there going to be another book????Lots of unanswered questions!!!!!	3
6874	A2AISWEPOD9EL1	I enjoyed the story but it was way too short. There could have  been more to it. I recommend it if you want a nice short read.	3
6875	A1O4UJJRVKRNM9	This didn't seem finished to me. Sexy and hot, but the story didn't go anywhere. Would make a great novel fleshed out. Felt let down.	3
6876	A2D7DS1DGAWGVR	Not a bad book but have read better, just because every woman doesn't have big breast doesn't mean she can't do the job	2
6877	A2UXJ19I4FQJUN	it was a nice read but left you at a big clifhanger. would be betther to get the complete set.	2

6879	A3PAULLSHLIJX0	I liked the base of this story. It could have been more indepth and been longer. Could have had more of a story line.	2
6880	A3FSTB28ISLRC9	i loved this series! and I absolutely loved seeing it from cades point of view..i found it interesting and couldn't put it down!	3
6881	A1KBO3KCDFGJXJ	interesting plot twists I didn't see coming.  Penny is a little too mature for a teen, but that does not distract from the story line.	3
6882	A3B8B02MIZ12LZ	I enjoyed the snippet of insight of Sicarius, but only because I'm reading her EE series. Too short is my chief complaint, even for a short story.	2
6883	A3W31E0Z5AGSC	I'm glad I didn't purchase this book...got it on my Prime. It is the worst of Me.Le Veque,s books I have read. Was very disappointed!	1
6884	AHMJQ66XNCOJI	The book is good but kind of boring. I really want to know how the couple turned out what formed to them	2
6885	A332Q8YWI42J90	Not much different than the movie with Alda.  The only difference being the ending. Not much to hold my interest.	1
6886	A19K5TGZLXNDLC	Wonderful story that has a smooth continuous flow. I really enjoyed the storyline and the characters. Would follow this author for bigger and better works.	3
6887	A9QW7HA1Y9Z3N	Silk was an OK read. I was really disappointed on how the author ended the book. Silk could have been longer then what it was.	2
6888	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Did not read past first few pages.  Something turned me off.  Writing wasn't bad but I could not get into the plot.  Maybe it was too thin..	0
6889	A1JU5DX8UFSUZM	A modern girls version of Cinderella and Prince Charming all rolled into one.  Even though the story is good I prefer real love the old fashioned way--not just sex.	3
6890	A1JUT02AY65KD7	Better than most, and indicates a promising author. I will read all that he writes if he can keep it up.	3
6891	A18OEUAOPZY6GL	It was a fun, quick read.  Pretty true the genre.  I enjoyed the book and read it in an afternoon.	3
6892	A3F7BZ9DIESY51	This story was enjoyable and look forward to the next installment. My only negative was the cliffhanger ending! Those always kill me.	3
6893	A3UYZGO1Y5HYDL	It was a good read when I was waiting for some others to come out.  I think it is a stand alone which I really liked.	3
6894	AW7SM5XG88UEO	Quite an uninspiring and silly novel.  INTERESTING premise but the author did not develop it in any way whatsoever.  Not worth it....	0
6895	A3T4BBX7C1E8CH	Short and anything but sweet. It has a bit of truth in it and very insightful. I enjoyed it very much.	2
6896	AX3W2FJYMPWZQ	not an outstanding effort, but an enjoyable story to read. i prefer her full length novels. it gives her more time to develop the characters.	2
6897	A1KVUC3FPDTI1E	There was a lot of typographic errors.  This made it hard to read.  The storyline was good.  I think the volumes could be combined for better reading.	1
6898	AR560Y77KBSMN	No matter what Sharon Lathan writes it is always well done and worth reading. She is very talented. I always enjoy  her work.	3
6899	A23JMZ4JOB02W7	A short but good book. It was very helpful, a lot faster than figuring it out unassisted. Definitely a worthwhile read.	3
6900	A1IQPO2P7YOO23	Lot's of mysteries for the two senior sleuths to solve.  An enjoyable read.  Looking forward to the next. I recommend this series.	3
6901	AB21PLZLWGDE5	Overall nice storyline.  What I didn't like was way too much detail on non-relevant issues.  I guess I'll just waiting for part two.	2
6902	A1L2S3VHG2AA96	We have all had one , but wow to have yr rock star sweep you off yr feet and make all yr fantasies come true.....Mmmmmmm yes please.	2
6903	A31S0HSNNCYE6U	Probably good for a motre advanced user. For the beginner, only so so! To much other uses for my Kindle to study the &#34;Hows&#34; in this manual.	2
6904	A2SUJC2MFXOUCG	Thought was a good short read, characters well developed and good plot. Good wrap up for a short. Would read more by this author.	3
6905	A2ZTLL9J88DR0H	I need more !!! You can't reveal an ending like that then say the end. Where were they ? What happened? I need the answers.	2
6906	A11KXJJD45Q01S	Look forward to the next book, want to see how all the characters work together to the final portion of this story.	3
6907	AUHAHMVQ49FM	Been a while since i read this one.I have it down as 3 stars I did not make any notes on it so can't say more.	2
6908	AJB2YLR6ZBOBU	This was a sweet, but steamy love story. The guardian was too stubborn, I wanted to throttle him. I enjoyed reading this book. Kudos to Ms. Ireland	3
6909	A14VXQ8RLUFS0O	A good read with an interesting storyline.  Miss Weber is able to keep you interested and reading to the end if the story.	3
6910	A3T381VVCYKSLN	Interesting pics and brings them to life in a way that children can appreciate.  I enjoy them too.  Nicely done	3
6911	A1GWRTN8E55JQR	"Bought this because I enjoyed the ""clipper"" books. I found this to be short but entertaining and I will probably look for other short stories."	3
6912	AJZ66E1PZ0ONV	This was a good one to read to children. It was colorfully illustrated. Overall, it's not one of my new favorites, but it was well worth while.	3
6913	A1IQOX3HU8C6FI	This was a short sexy story. It is a short story and I should have checked this before spending 99 cents. B	2
6914	A2CUS3NF0CEQ6Y	"Looking forward to continuing with these feisty characters who would make good friends to anyone.  Pleasant afternoon ""escape"" read for anyone!"	3
6915	A3P9S4BNKUQTN8	Good book that I read when I was young, and now my children get a chance to read it too.	3
6916	A2YTYVJ96EENYJ	I liked the book but it had a typical bad boy returns home to redeem himself.  He hooks up with the local nice girl.  Everyone is happy in the end.	3
6917	ADQY0CI1V6ITX	This was such a fast read. I enjoyed the premise and found myself already looking for the next part of the story.	3
6918	A19T2M4IMVAFI5	Was expecting more from this Sam Duke. It was an ok read; l enjoy the cast of characters for me the story was lacking.	3
6919	A2XVZDFJGT7JM8	Another triumph from Robin. Such a great storyteller who captures her characters on the page so well. Do yourself a favour and read this series.	3
6920	A3V25W6BAHBDPR	This is a good book for a afternoon read. The story is good, it is easy to read and there is not any foul language. Good on vacation read.	3
6921	ACHHYS5X7YFG1	Full of action and kept my interest.  Sex was too descriptive for taste.  I prefer to leave something to the imagination.	3
6922	A218AIS1JDR5VO	The writing is juvenile.  Don't get it even if it's free.  It's a nice cover, but it makes for false advertising.	0
6923	A13HCH3I2G3DSV	I chose the 3 stars because I was able to put it down and read something else.  Therefore really forgetting what was going on in the story.	2
6924	A19OJ7L2JSE60F	I enjoyed the story and all of her books are free from grammar issues that seem to plague so many books.  This is a light hearted romance with fun characters.	3
6925	A1UC2PL7FYU6S2	I was not interested in the recommended books. Most seem to be female oriented.I also noticed a lot of female authors.	1
6926	AR4MM68FE251H	This book was the dumbest  book yet I didn't like it one but it was meaningless and what happen to the rest	0
6927	A3TI5ECE2RT4FE	I enjoyed reading this book. Even though it was fiction, I felt like it really could have happened and it had two stories in one.	3
6928	A1E7RARAPTT948	The story was very light, yet entertaining.  Parts dragged slowly, but the last quarter of the book made it worthwhile reading till the end.	2
6929	A1ORUST0X5W6CB	This is a decent way to write a book and keep people coming back again and again.  I would still like to see it as a complete work.	2
6930	A2TQE2AF176XE7	lots of prayers, a little to old for my grandchildren. they are 2 and 3.  so we will just keep till they get into school.	3
6931	A1Z9TLKF1EK183	tHIS WAS DEF A GOOD READ AND PICKED UP RIGHT WHERE IT KLEFT OF.. tOBE SHORT jOY KING IS DOING HER THING WITH THESE SERIES	3
6932	A35PJQKLW12ULA	Not what I was looking for in a cookbook.  Some cleaning tips were really obsolete.  I would only see this book as a vision of how things use to be.	1
6933	A2MTD5UUQ395MR	Not my favorite, but I am a Kingdom fan so I'm in.  Needed more tension between the characters and could see the twist a mile away.	2
6934	A28REJAM6899K8	I do not know if she really deserved this much sexual introduction at her age but she got what she wanted and so did he.	3
6935	A16VCL7MJQC56F	Please delete from my list. It's been too long since reading it	0
6936	A1HPGFHDRXGGWZ	I would love to read more about these characters! I was so disappointed when there was only three books .... but at least we get these bonus packs!	3
6937	A1GL6Q9RJHCK9P	This was not such a great book.I didn't have a problem with the main couples' relationship but I wish there was more substance to this tale and less faithless homosexuality.	1
6938	AJVL9RWT5RTMY	"Fun book for light reading. Very original "" end of the world"" concept. The author has a very vivid imagination and I especially liked the pixies."	2
6939	A30IRW5PUEP5GT	The chapters flow seamlessly from one to the next affording the reader plenty of time and opportunities to lose themselves in the story as it unfolds.	2
6940	A21TDEYVIR1OBZ	I wasn't as impressed with this series as others by thus author.  I struggled thru all the books. But I kept thinking it would get better.  It really didn't.	1
6941	A2APIDG2YR9JL8	Not bad. Short and quick.	2
6942	A3KPSXIQK4DXEU	A good storey with good descriptions of the places, conditions,and life in the old west. the editing is not great but still a pleasant read.	3
6943	AR1O0GUNLY45V	this is good read but predictable	2
6944	ASICGGCGW70SI	Nice story. I love a good love at first sight story. I also like the nice twist to the story.	3
6945	A3OI13SD7AB6VH	This was a good short story with lots of action and drama from the beginning to end. I didnt like the way it ended with unanswered questions.	3
6946	A24APWWB5K8IIR	AEasy book to read.  I like that you were kept wondering who it was and then is turned out to be entirely differe	3
6947	A1SVKXS358TXW2	I did like the book. I WISHED IT was a little longer.but it is a good short story.  so go on read it	2
6948	A155GBGUKC1QSR	OMG, what a weak woman.  I just wanted her to at least put up SOME kind of fight.  Instead she just let them push her around. Pathetic.	0
6949	A3NALTG52VTTBI	I learned that gay guys don't smoke weed.Great read if you want some pow that is really waffy.	3
6950	A1VUIZS50V552O	This was a very good read. Living close to where the book took place made it more interesting. Looking forward to more.	3
6951	AVZFSE5AGJE50	This was a short but good story. It caused you to feel for the characters right away. Just wish it had been longer.	3
6952	A20FEEWRFZ6557	Well the title says it all - I like Ashley and Rick's story the best they're a great couple :)	2
6953	A212QA30WPM5PC	Somewhat of a strange book, but short and interesting.  Shows you what a mind can do when under a lot of stress or loss of a loved one.	2
6954	A3TC60MGLW1I76	This is a short story, only 101pages.It's an erotic romance and there are quite a few graphical scenes but it's well written.	2
6955	A11PH5MB4UMPID	Interesting and sexy most of the book but the conclusion was in rush and unsatisfying. I generally recommend this author.	3
6956	AF6P8EWWWJL7M	This book was good, but you really have to concentrate when reading it because there is a late going on. These wolves and vampires are not your everyday wolves.	3
6957	A3T6QLKAI0RVHO	Relatively good story.  Characters were a little too innocent for their ages.  Nothing wrong with innocent teens, just not realistic for 20 year olds.	3
6958	A2C7W167DVNUKH	I ENJOYED THE characters in this book and the twisting plot. An entertaining read worth the time and effort. Recommended.	2
6959	A1DPHELR3A8VEG	Very basic if you know nothing about the subject then your in luck. If you have ever picked up a shovel or grew a tomato plant don't waste your time.	2
6960	A3949AG9T3CCUK	Great ending to Donnie & Costas story ( worried for awhile they wouldn't make it). Enjoy all of this series	3
6961	A3PVL8G79K4GO	I really did not care for this book, and didn't finish it.  Guess it just wasn't what I expected it to be.	1
6962	A3TOHLCVZGBLKL	I read this book 20yrs ago. Decided to re read it & thoroughly enjoyed it again.I would recommend this book	3
6963	A2ABD6URNHZ5I6	Good story idea. A few grammatical errors. Could be an interesting book series. If you like stories of the Fey give this series a try.	2
6964	A1W7PLOEMUWE8W	I liked this simply sweet story!  The writing showcases how difficult life stories can improve with hope and faith in one another.	3
6965	A2RNLWK3J6ODCN	A couple of Badly done pictures that my kid could do better with and a couple very short sentences about the books in the series. Complete waste of time!!!!!	0
6966	AQR4NNBP4N63E	I wanted a plain, rich, unscented (or barely scented) butter. Nope, lots of scents, complex formulas. Nothing basic. Have to read, experiment, adjust and see what I get.	2
6967	A3AQKF73Y2VWTL	This story is sweet and has a nice plot and great chemistry between the two characters. It makes me want to read the next to see what happens.	3
6968	A1CGOR398UH1IB	This book had everything! Two women, best friends, trying to solve a murder. Well developed characters that I hope to hear more from.	3
6969	A1YK3DC6S21DER	this is a book that you start out think will be worth reading, i was glad when it was over.	1
6970	A2VUDEZFABPHRC	Just an all over great book, with a great author. If you're unfamiliar with Blake Crouch, I highly recommend checking into him.	3

6974	A14V90HRZPE58E	If you are looking for a book that will help you relax and escape into another world while reading, then go ahead and read this one.	3
6975	ABNX7AFER0SHK	did not like this book at all in faxed i deleted this book and didnt even finish it. so I would not recommend this book at all.	0
6976	A3A6WRN2IONFBQ	3.5 STARSSweet story with a little bite of angst and a tough subject.  It will pull on your heart strings a hair.	3
6977	A19T1A4TS1WHOZ	not a book. More of a teaser. Interesting premise of a sort of Mexican werewolf thing with a volatile history.	2
6978	A2UNSFC4PQNCZR	This was a very sweet story. D rose came through with another good story. Please read this author books, very good .	3

6980	AX7ZRV05WPVK2	Nice. I love the characters.  It's a quick read. Read the others first.  I cannot wait for the next book. Highly recommended.	3
6981	A1LJP6K83TLP8N	I'd heard most of these jokes years ago and the jokes that I never heard before were not that good.	1
6982	AECCGYOVX2A0K	I' m gonna finish all of these in 1 day I just know that I will,it kinda sucks :P XD	3
6983	A2VW1QYZOELXS3	The premise wasn't something I could get in to.  The writing was fine, the story was too fantastic. Might be good for the YA audience.	1
6984	A3W4PH6ZA5M3AI	This book was a short read that left you wondering what else?  Zane could do better and add more.  Not her usual work.	2
6985	A8KQLOBO0YEKK	Interesting dialog about a very sad situation.  I like to read about a family in a different culture; but this family is destined to hardship.	2
6986	A386CNLWZUF3EH	This was a pretty good sci-fi, a rather good concept.  I enjoyed this book but not enough to buy the rest of the series.	3
6987	A3F7OP2QILMP8T	I liked the characters and wanted to know more about their lives.  It's not rocket science but an enjoyable read nonetheless.	3
6988	AY7JWB6MCA2R5	Great story telling but ended too soon, even for a short story.. felt taken with the cost. Would not recommend	1
6989	A3KUTX3ZU04W9I	I enjoyed the book and the twists that came with it. It was worth my time and money! Can't wait for part 2	2
6990	A1OMNUD66UTHQT	The first book was OK but the second was a trial to get thru.  I skimmed to the end to &#34;have read it&#34;	1
6991	A3SXG6TX7RF3ZL	I loved this book was so funny had me laughing out loud,I will difinitly be looking for more from Mrs Morgan. Only complaint to short.	3
6992	A2X954H4KMNW6W	Well written story about loss, cruelty, and an unforgettable reunion.  This mystery will leave you speechless in the end.  Mystery at its best.	3
6993	A39P8L14E5ENM9	I did not like the book - had no interest in reading it cover to cover and deleted it as soon as I scanned it.	0
6994	ASW954HIY3XRV	Quick read, cute story. Needs a little more editing for typos and missing words. Might try the rest of the series.	2
6995	A1SSYYL2WTAK4Y	Enjoyed the book. Kept me guessing right to the end. I will be looking forward to the next one. This is one of those books you can't put down..	3
6996	A1HLL52JX0RFW2	A pleasant romance, with an independent heroine and a charming hero. Nothing unrealistic in this story, no outlandish wealth or beauty, no ridiculous contrived conflicts. Just a sweet story	3
6997	A2AI4R4JQ6Q772	4 STARS TO GERRI BROUSSEAU FOR A TIMELESS ROMANCE THAT USES THE LEGENDS OF THE PEOPLE TO WEAVE A BEAUTIFUL TIMELESS STORY.	3
6998	AI2Y69N3X5RU2	I enjoyed reading it. I was surprised at how things moved in the book. I liked the secrets and how things moved in the end.	2
6999	AR560Y77KBSMN	Ok but not great. Short stories are not my thing.  Everything from dialogue to characters is abriviated.You can't really expound on the story with so few words.	2
7000	A8VD0YO97171R	This book was HOT!!  didn't want it to end. I recommend and will re-read. Looking forward to more HOT books like this!!	3
7001	A258BR9WV173WH	no sex,no gun battles just a good old fashion ghost story i like it will look for more from this author	3

7003	A14NDW1QYR2LWW	This was a well done short story. The storyline was well done and well thought out. I can hardly wait to read the newest  book.	3
7004	A3CCERUINJC1EA	I'm angry at David. I can't even write about this book except to say it was shockingly painful to read. A very tearful twistedLove story.	3
7005	AQI033SOZZ2G6	I chose this book because is a mystery,  my favorite.  The plot seemed some what believable but t o o simplistic.	3
7006	AXGTDFOYMG562	The book was good, however it did jump around a lot. Sometimes  hard to read and keep interest. However it was a good book.	2
7007	A2R55EE2HMCSBD	Will probably. Read the t test of the story and enjoyed this first chapter. The characters were set up well and the story was easy to follow.	2
7008	AWZCJK6MA2UH4	Very short and sweet story for a young child. My 6 year old thought it was ok. A younger child wouldenjoy it more.	3
7009	A9HXZ458VITH2	Great little snippet of young(er) Kit Colbana and her interaction with the rat shifter gangs and the vamp Jude.  I really enjoyed it.	3
7010	A2NR7RNYEY937I	probably it was the writing style, or the setting but I didn't buy ine line of this book. and the cover just tells me to stay away from it.	1
7011	A2GO6DNK3805LO	It was an easy reading. I like the main character and at times it was confusing with some many suspects but it went well.	3
7012	A2KPDRY4YRR7WP	It was the right price. FREE. Really meant for reading when you're bored and don't want to delve full-on into something else.Recommended? Free, Yes. If you pay, No.	2
7013	A1DFVQAXCPK1BA	Ella did it again. I love this series. I can never get enough of the Hart family. I look forward to more in the future.	3
7014	A3U7DU2FCGJD85	This book started out slowly but gathers steam along the way to it's favorable ending. The secret plots catch you by surprise and makes the best story.	3
7015	A3NX3NFWUOCFUU	Liked the fact that there was a good story and good character development,look forward to the next tale in the series	3
7016	A3APUO4R7659AE	Hopefully I will not have to use this, but it is good to have a plan B. And it was a fair price.	2
7017	AR1O641GJ7JQD	I have never taken a cruise and found some interesting information about cruising in this book. Probably information seasoned cruisers know but not novices.	3
7018	A4R0SSPSHDQKZ	This book was pitifully basic and generally just a waste of time to read.  I was sorely disappointed.  Stick to fiction.	1
7019	A29QM2KSNQ0XQH	Oh, to have a love like Miranda has from Hunter... every woman's dream!  This is a lovely love story and I highly recommend it to everyone.	3
7020	A1YAW3RF0YOLBZ	I have read better books but I hate tongue twisters but not as good as scaly tales or the ugly truth those are gooooooooooooooooood books	2
7021	A2PB9H60NZQ2WV	Really enjoyed this book even though some parts where a little drawn out. Would have liked an epilogue to see what happens down the road	3
7022	A1IE903LH8HVHQ	it had a horrible beginning with the writing and what it said that i didn't go any further than that.	1
7023	A38J1AP0ZA3UNB	Paranormal lovers alike this story is for you. A truly surprise read that kept me laughing. I will be finishing all the books in this series!	3
7024	A2N0V6GUH28XMN	What a hot sequel. I am sick and this book made me even more hot and bothered. If there is another book I'm definitely noting.	3
7025	A3OJVEIQAQAOGE	I liked this book, but mostly because i like the supernatural aspect of it. If you are into True blood or any other supernatural series, this is a good read.	2
7026	A2B2E10C1PFJYN	This vampire is so unlike any of the traditional ones that it is intriguing. It is fun to see her discover her capabilities and the story line is interesting.	3
7027	A1CYMUAHPWCX0P	Easy to read intro to Paleo eating, but I did not care for the comments about people not sticking with Paleo. I needed a cheerleader.	1
7028	A2L1XDHGQIU7S9	I absolutely loved this book and I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next in this series and more by this author.	3
7029	A18EEC1ENOT9YN	Not my type of reading material.  Some people may think that this author writes well.  This will be their choice.	0
7030	A4R95MASKAMP6	Pretty pictures!  Young children will enjoy Petal the Owl and this is a great way for kids to learn their colors.	2
7031	A2CXQ8TFHHLMG5	The book is a pageturner. Characters are so vividly and successfully described. Narration is smooth and the story captures the reader's interest.	3
7032	A2YRZ7PEKEF2ML	This was a cute little read. Cannot complain much about writing style or plot considering the price. But overall it served its purpose of entertaining me slightly.	2
7033	A317YD3C1B79LP	I usually do not care for these stories where the husband is in agreement.  However, in this book the husband is at least somewhat hesitant.  The book is ok.	3
7034	AG6295PN872YZ	I really enjoyed it I t was an easy read You felt comfortable with the characters and the story kept you interested all the way through	3
7035	A30K9MEPFESK61	Nothing special going on here. Lots of pics and it was free when I got it. I scanned it then got rid of it.	1
7036	A2ZZBUXG5JWDS0	A very interesting story, loveable characters, short and sweet.I can't wait to see where this story goes. Next please.	3
7037	ANK5N2QDYBARS	James Rollins has written some very good books.  This is not one of them.  For a short story it is not bad, but I prefer longer books.	1
7038	A2U4TDDFWAVNYF	EVERY WOMAN'S FANTASY COME TRUE.  THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT BUT FASCINATING AND IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK.  ENDED TOO QUICKLY.  T.K.	3
7039	A1N06EKVN7PP5Z	I had to force myself to read this book. It was all over the place and I didn't even really like any of the characters.	2
7040	A2XZUTLKSCXS1A	Fun holiday story and interesting characters. The story was unique with Cindy getting into some really funny situations. Bond is a very good writer, easy to read.	3
7041	A3QCBAUJCCWG8K	Great story, would rate to 5 but the book needs some editing done. Still readable, very predictable. But great story none the less.	3
7042	A3H06Z3IRSVGYD	This was badly edited. I didn't like the heroine. Didn't get a chance to know the hero. And it had a TERRIBLE cliffhanger - the book just STOPPED without warning.	1
7043	A1U3Z4ZHK688W7	The beginning started off well, but at the end it crashed.  It really could have been a story with there were better events leading to the conclusion of the story	2
7044	AK2VV902INMV0	Cute story. No sex, but it did have foreplay....so not clean. Characters were pretty good. Story line was sweet. Liked it.	3
7045	A8Q1H5ZA0XGGH	Good character development and very interesting set of premises. Actually a little scary and probably too possible. A little too techy at times, but we'll written paced.	3
7046	A3NMO3K0QVQH66	I enjoyed the book, even though it has the overbearing billionaire in it, wanting to control everyone's lives.It still worked well.I enjoyed the dynamic between the characters.I would recommend it.	3
7047	A3CRU4A7R48QZK	The book was good until the crappy ending I feel like I wasted time on this book guess there might be a next book but I am not sure	1
7048	A3N1B0TY95P9PF	Sweet little follow up which fulfils your Chris/Mia addiction. Chris is still as crazy about Mia as ever! Definitely worth the price!	2
7049	A228SRMN7RV2N	A bunch of stresses that work for pulled muscles, stiff muscles...things like that but don't expect any kind of miracle.	2
7050	A323H7CL7G313K	I enjoyed this book. The plot is very realistic. The storyline is full of surprises. I am looking forward to reading more of this author's work.	3
7051	AHOSU079XZKAE	Great product and for a great price. Always getting stuff from Amazon is a great relief on the wallet and you can find everything!!!!!!loved the book!!!!	2
7052	A3H3RDOL7ZABLV	Cute but long. It's been done before. The characters are charming and nothing bad happens. Nice summer holidays, beach book.	2
7053	A2D7DS1DGAWGVR	It all worked out in the end they both got what they wanted and then some to be exact great	2
7054	A2Q31GU5220T8G	Very good. Can not wait for the next one. As good as David weber . Actually it is better than his present Harrington and safe hold story.	3
7055	AY79J2HJAID7X	"Lots of jokes about raining. Some didn't really sound right. There were several good ones but nothing to call ""ultimate""."	1
7056	A20JYKLNERYZPF	I really enjoyed this book. Different, unpredictable story line. I loved the characters in all their imperfect glory! Loved It!	3
7057	A2EVOH77WYTRIZ	This was a good story, and very steamy. I would like to read more about these characters.  I wish it hadn't been so short.	2
7058	A19LU01BKW7XVD	i have posted about all 3 of these books, my neice realy enjoyed it, the entire series was a fast fun read	3
7059	A3J880REVEJ8YO	Erickson is a great story teller. Perfect Crime is a marvellous introduction to his work. I will read more of this author.	3
7060	AYC2MXI55HIAR	The book started well, with a suspenseful scene, but it quickly derailed into a poorly written romance. I couldn't find any reason to keep reading.	1
7061	A36QC6GS79GLHJ	I really enjoyed this, again.  This series is a really fun, light and entertaining read and I will continue to read the series.	3
7062	A2GT3TNFITYMML	This one was not my style. I couldn't finish it.I didn't like the characters too. I couldn't get into the story.	1
7063	A2NMG3C1OFRG3H	This book has lots of potential. It could have given more background info on the characters. Guess I will have to read the sequel to see what happens.	3
7064	A30K9MEPFESK61	This was a free download that was short, sweet and to the point. Good for what it was but not a favorite.	2
7065	A3UUCM0KED1KB	Really well written!  LOVED the first sentence!  Characters were believable and enjoyable!A touch of humour made them seem even more real somehow.	3
7066	A2Q7XQAHNOEHV2	It was steamy thats for sure, but really odd. It left it open for more and i will most likely read it :/	2
7067	AUCZXOKQCDCKO	A good read if you enjoy that period in time.  Did not like the main character woman in the book. Very annoying	2
7068	ANAXV82XD0KAB	Although the recipes all sound good I only gave three stars because many of them include yeast.  I prefer sourdough recipes that do NOT use yeast.	2
7069	A21IXK2KKMPZ74	I have just started reading the series and have enjoyed it, it has definitely made me want more, I only hope the rest of thbooks are as good.	3
7070	A92CGTLU7VTPC	As expected of Lindsay buroker. Add a bit of action, a dash of unique words, and throw them into the heart of some city, and you have a story.	3
7071	A33KNBGC6UM133	This book was pretty good. Not fantastic but pretty good. It drug on a little bit. Great characters. Good story line.	3
7072	ABY7WGLBCMCCE	Good, practical advice. Really liked the legal and medical concerns expressed. Good food for thought.Helpful and inexpensive ways to be safe in any setting or room.	3
7073	ADN9BPBA44KIY	I like it a lot because it was super adorable, romantic and nicei think anyone can fall in love with this	3
7074	A329KOXNB0R3SF	This was just too stereotypical for me. Or maybe I am too jaded from reading all the manga brought overseas these days.. they are all the same!	0
7075	A3M8GHC2QS0UVN	In my opinion this story should be shorter.It is a good story, but I was not hooked by it.	2
7076	A9CZ92A7C224K	I though the book was pretty good.Lots of action, which is a must happen to keep my interest level up.We	3
7077	A119K9E3BCHJK7	I felt that this was a good series it held up.If you want something to keep you occupied then I can recommend this series.	3
7078	A531QY5K7JVXI	If you want to read a thoroughly predictable short story about a Doctor and a paramedic that has no depth and little plot this is for you.	1
7079	A13BZ0Z1FTV84H	Some but they are funny and awesome of these jokes aren't good for your kids to readGood luck with men and women who are funny and kids next year old	2
7080	A22GGHISKRVAOX	I typically don't like third-person perspective stories, but this book was in some ways an exception, about a man dealing with his formerly-abusive father's impending death by cancer.	2
7081	A2DQWWJ2HYR5C0	So lame I never even got past the first third. Poorly written, poorly conceived, and I am glad it was free.	0
7082	A1IJP6P1XEY051	Had not known about the actions of the characters before.  Maybe with life anything can be.  If in conversationsomeone is curious I would recommend this book.	2
7083	A1F06496ZDQFJE	I enjoyed reading Lady Bess.  I recommend this book as a nice summer read.  The story kept my attention and the characters were enjoyable.	3
7084	A2QK5QZEVY31KG	Interesting mystery thriller with plenty of history about Sweden and Norway. Good characters and details. Plenty of thrills and chills.	3
7085	A3NMO3K0QVQH66	I would have loved to buy the 3 books after this on but it is ridiculously expensive for the pages that you get.I liked this story.	3
7086	A1ELVLUIIEYSUQ	this book should not even be sold.it dosent make any since.whos sam or joe.whats a burner phone.go to delete it	0
7087	A3TNAAJ066E0I6	Deborah Bladon has written another winner.  So much drama.  The book takes another unforseen twist at the end.  Good sequel to the first book.  Can't wait to read the finale.	3
7088	A10S049RIL1LY0	I read this to my grandson and nephew. They laughed and they learned-its a perfect combination. I highly recommend it.	3
7089	A1004FEMPLDXKX	This was a good read,I can't say I was chilled to the bone, but did enjoy it end to end.	3
7090	AR560Y77KBSMN	I really enjoyed this book. It was wordy in places,but all in all it was worth the read. And they lived happily ever after.	3
7091	A1ZRNZZNB3W1YL	I did not like this story.  Maybe it was due to the fact that I could not relate to the characters.	0
7092	A25CP6UY1I2W5X	Pretty interesting. I enjoyed how they finally made it to the bedroom. I can't think that any police officer would behave like this, but it made for some fine reading.	3
7093	A18MOG89UURP7K	A good fast and enjoyable read.  I really liked the characters of Lark and Mason , and cant wait to read about sister Aries in the next book.	2
7094	A1VK0IKL1J7I5P	Great variety of stories, with a little something for everyone. Lots of different writing styles and sexy scenes. Even thought they are only short they are still hot.	3
7095	A1SXBV5JQ9I0F8	Not bad, not great - but  as it was free a good short read. Interesting set up and the full novel should be good!	2
7096	A2TV3OK4M0O0XM	Really enjoyed this series. The ending seems a little far fetched, but that's why it is fiction.  Overall good writing with few grammatical errors.	3
7097	A3CEHD815XMMYG	Only one or two of the recipes seemed to be yummy. I do have some food allergies so I need to substitute the dairy products.	2
7098	A1I96OYAUJ3HQE	they were pretty good.. some of them i had read before..  some were pretty slow and i just skipped over them.. but all in all the books were good..	3
7099	A16KG2ZBR2EK7X	I liked where the story was going, but it was just a little too fast and too short for my liking.	2
7100	AM4MO8W58U45D	I had hopes that this book would be fun and humourous.  But I didn't finish it as it became so slow and torturous.	2
7101	AYB90RJXY32BI	One Last Bite was entirely too short!!!!!!Great story but it's not nice to tease! Very interested in this story and characters.	2
7102	A39FMUQHHBOB2T	This book had some good tips for photography, but I wish it did not try to sell me other books in the beginning.	2
7103	A2CHU743KZBRTG	Good story line in a great location, an old vineyard.  Waxes of &#34;The Shining&#34; by Stephen King with just as much suspense and creepiness.  Nice twists.  Good read.	3
7104	A1IU8HLUPCY8Y2	Who knows what will drive people to do something so evil. Everyone has a breaking point but thankfully not all break like this.	3
7105	A2YATE0D7L8XL	OK,  I know it was a book but come on. 2 kids having sex in a sleeping bag on the sidewalk with other people around them? REALLY!	1
7106	APFP647QZR7HI	I choose this ratting is besause I enjoyed the reading of it. And IAM would let my friends know about this book. Looking forward to reading the other Wild Series.	3
7107	A1QVRO7FNATJKX	It's a totally cute feel good romance. Quick and easy read but left me with a sweet smile.  Would recommend for a fun read	3
7108	ARNF0LG0K2QAJ	I love Cynthia Hickey! Her writing style suits me. I like a clean read with fast paced adventure and laughs. Real life experiences and embarrassments. Yep, I liked it.	3
7109	A16CWH11TBIXZC	Editing was almost nonexistent. Fairly good story but not really believable - and not much suspense. I'll pass on any more Blake.	2
7110	A2RWZKMC2E9864	These jokes were unoriginal, boring and some of them just plain stupid. Thank god it was free, no money will ever be made off of this.	0
7111	A2LKVJ3HM9FKUE	It ok book	1
7112	A255L0RTBZR2P3	An enjoyable read and one that held my interest from start to finish. I like the characters and the way they interacted. A recommended read.	3
7113	A2IN7DQIQ3EANS	No text for this review. I liked this book, but be warned it is very sexually graphic. Not a book for children	3
7114	A2NRDWWE0Z5HI0	Good end to the series, but a lacking in the end.  Characters were very predictable and  left it open for another book.	3
7115	A12TA6TZJKVO9S	Erotica short story that will please anyone looking for something short and to the point. Well written and a fun quick read.~A.S. Johnson, author	3
7116	A2J5LFVUV23Q97	Good reading if you like romance novels. I know the ladies will love it. I read a lot and this was a good book.	3
7117	A2DMM4YRMWNQ4V	LIKED THIS AUTHOR ALOT,writing about Georgia and small town,is a good ,light ,fun read with mystery.would read again,read first book also	3
7118	AW2COSIBMO3PH	Cool story. Fast and enjoyable read if you're into this type of story. A few little twists kept it interesting enough.	2
7119	AA6KQJT64RJ60	ok reading, interesting story, but too short and not enough about the characters or the times.	2
7120	A28WM3C134GNSZ	Enjoyed it, it was a light read but just what I needed at the time, would make a great hollywood movie	2
7121	A3BJC6NP2RQVTK	This was a good book, interesting, kept the story going with out alot of slow areas, would recomend it to friends.	3
7122	A2DGT2J1TA1VWQ	We liked the story and the development of the plot in this and will definitely read more Ben Bridges books.	3
7123	A18JH4B2N3C6B4	I love this kind of book. I look for reads like this and it didnt disappoint! Its a wonderful read and perfect romance! Read it!	3
7124	A7DOO7L5NOOTT	A little magic, a little romance and a lot of snow... Good quick read. It was an entertaining holiday story.	3
7125	A307ISA4AOH6D9	I found this book to be very interesting. Not only for the hauntings, but for the historical stories. I would have liked to see much more pictures though.	3
7126	A3BXZIELEWP694	I love football and this was overall a good book.	3
7127	A3MUSWDCTZINQZ	I can apply this visor and take if off with no problems or air bubbles.  I would recommend this product to others.	3
7128	A1WNMUC7T526IJ	I sure am glad this book was free.  If I had paid for it I would have been upset!  The photos were good but other than that a wasn't impressed!	1
7129	A1YQ1FCM5JRS1M	hmm not too bad but he got away with a lot I help  believe he did care but it's still not okay	2
7130	A2F1A7DANSLFJ9	Dark topic but written well.  There is no way you can read this and not feel for both the main characters!	3
7131	AG17ES9DSRXA1	It's an ok book. Nothing to sensational. I don't like the books that stop mid action and then you have to wait for the next one to finish the story.	1
7132	A3CMYOIIP0OCRI	Good read.  Thrilling.  Keeps you engaged for the next chapters as the story unfolds.  Would recommend to all looking for a good read.	3
7133	A31SQHOVLXGHXV	Not my cup of tea.  Really had a confusing ending that I could not grasp.  Was bored before I finished it.	1
7134	A3NGKYUT5LP9U2	The story is different than any other romance novels I have read.  I like how the main characters have similar histories.	3
7135	ASNJMMQ7BB0S3	.....on an old theme. Very enjoyable mystery.  The main character isn't to sympathetic. The ending was a little abrupt but fitting.	3
7136	A6C4YMLS1PES0	This book was just ok. It was better than the heavenly inn mysteries though and I might actually read another to see how bekka and Nick 's relationship progress.	1
7137	AWVP69V3Y4CTB	Too much sex, not enough story, unappealing characters, just not for me - got tired of skimming looking for the story.	1
7138	A2WBPL9XLD02Y7	First story was fun, but the last four were just ok.  Everyone could probably find a story they liked it the book.	2
7139	A2HOS8V6RAELRT	Way too short. To fast. It really could of been part of the last book. I loved the 5 book series.	1
7140	A1DRZSVYP44N9P	The twist is surprising and I can identify with the heroine, I'd feel the same way.  Totally want this guys bedroom.	3
7141	A1D48PA49JRQM6	Good story, well written, perhaps a little too much sex. But I really did like the story so I do recommend this book.	2
7142	A2TFXMKTCVI2SW	Nice story and, I guess, sets the stage for at least one (if not more) follow-on books.  Will look to see if there's a sequel to this one.	3
7143	A2FWXQODZU0BFW	I finished this book without caring how the series finished out. I was well written, but more for a younger reader. What am i saying I love Artimus Fowl	1
7144	A2RA049BXJXPMI	This book was good. I enjoyed it a lot. I was surprised by the twist and turns, especially at the end. I would like to read part 3 please.... :-D	3
7145	A1CBWDU4LR6UPE	For me this book was just ok.  I did read over half of it but I did not finish it.  Just did not keep my interest.	2
7146	ABXANRX4GPYRZ	Finally a Texas newspaper in Kindle format.Way to go Amazon !!	3
7147	A3KBRXW4PKK2MT	I love stories that are complex and love triangles. Charlotte should have realized her love for Finn and she should have been honest with Alex.	3
7148	AXITBLL9QXZY1	This is a no nonsense text that offers both ideas and practical information for putting the ideas to work. Great job.	3
7149	A2ETJ86XGTHL5P	Definitely NOT original or remarkable but does hold one's interest. Good story line.	3
7150	A1CK00HG4NWH4P	Showed this to my two yr old, caught his attention it's colourful, bright, I think this is a good start to introduce animals to children.	3
7151	A2AV3UMZZJOHA8	I should have read the reviews first.  This book was not what I expected - a completely different genre and I stopped reading well before the en.	1
7152	A3TN990PLQKHEN	I enjoyed this follow up to Christmas Cottage because with this sort of book, you want everyone to get their chance. It is a feel good book.	2
7153	A3OAYEQBLHVE09	The story was sweet, but needed more substance.  I would have loved to see how the relationship developed...I wanted more.	2
7154	A24OB0Y1OJ3A03	Ok book. The kids liked it. They thought it was fun to match the trucks to the people. It is more educational, but still fun.	2
7155	A3094BDN9YTIBN	slow but steady, it took some time to get to it but eventually I got into it and it wasn't disappointing	2
7156	A1KEK1S9VYOJ1Z	Interesting but a little short in length.  I agreed with many of her explanations and will reread her ideas again.J A Druce	1
7157	A2591Q7Y52U9N6	Honestly, this book is a mystery. It's as if you become a fly on the wall and listen in on random conversations about random people. Certainly no Treasure Island.	0
7158	A39GOW8SOSJKJ0	Great Story Line Kept Me Untreated I Hope Part Two Doesn't Take Long To Come Ou Because I Want To See Where This Story Is Going	3
7159	A13LERNQ8R7267	This was a good read. Will see what else this author rights. Would recommend this book to others. It was good.	2
7160	A20R37WRPLUM1D	No sex, just angst, longing, secrets, revelations, desire and finally resolution. It's a great little story, well scripted and played. I see there are two more stories in this series.	3
7161	A1TDR6SALBELOP	The games at the end and the song in the middle make for a fun children's story time book for a school or library.	3
7162	A36LDR0DEIKLST	soon as you get all into the book it ends I would like to continue the series but don't have the funds at the moment	3
7163	A3UBLFQDZ42QWZ	I usually like what Ted Dekker writes, but this short story really didn't do much for me. I just couldn't get into it. Not going to buy Forbidden.	1
7164	A2DKPHYOBHN16V	Too complicated for me.  Maybe will try reading this again sometime in the future, but this is not the time for me.	0
7165	AVYOJJDSPWNL9	I loved Emery and Wise together. I really didn't have any complaints, other than then the way then book ended. Looking forward to reading Part 2.	3
7166	A0090953K7LNUG6UPMI6	Ok, so I liked the story but was a bit up and down and the ending just left you there.....	2
7167	A2U811E4CB6Q8B	I wished for so much more with this book. Not the direction I was hoping for. It lacked the thrill and heat the first book gave you.	2
7168	A35910D7USTGL3	I screamed when the story ended or of the blue... it's ok I got the sequel than goodness... I would definitely recommend it's a great story	3
7169	A6Y92DB2QT9BH	Having never used coconut oil in cooking this book is a good introduction to cooking with it. Author includes 3-5 recipes for each section breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert.	3
7170	A1451Q6P18GH4	I really liked the way this book was written as it was much more than what I expected. I thought it was well written and was helpful to me.	3
7171	A2XRS79ZQGJSP8	This was my first read by this author. I really enjoyed this book. I can't wait for the next book to the series to be released.	3
7172	A2LFWDAWORQWHL	This story is too like others. There is great potential but it doesn't reach it. We meet, fall in love instantly, marry, baby.	1
7173	A1TY8CCEFR9Y8C	People pulling together in the common cause of safety and survival is my cup of tea.  A very good read with good characterization.	3
7174	A3AZHL1OUAQ7HY	this book didnt bring it liked i expected ,it was an ok read i hope that the next one brings a little bit more ..we will see	2
7175	A1CHO5ZH60QL6I	Great the way it turns the e reader off when you close it.Think it a bit overpriced (especially after postage).	3
7176	A0653433291SMBQM1ZO1H	This story was a nice clean read. It gave you the makings of a godly relationships and the components needed to make it last.  Trust and honesty.	3
7177	AB2486JUYXV07	Very short poem, not really long enough to be considered a book in my opinion. Cute illustrations. Three more words	3
7178	A2CWBZ7ZH4MGR6	A good mystery, but there is no way to tell from the description where this book comes in the series!	2
7179	A10VIFL1J72KX	En realidad no me ha gustado la trama, esperaba otra cosa del libro. me ha parecido aburrido, demasiado cursi, no es mi estilo.	1
7180	A3MX96YM4NT6HT	Reacher reads well in this novella format. Much of the lengthy descriptive filler has been trimmed and the result is a good story that moves along at a fast pace.	3
7181	A27JIBNF6OU6CH	This book just didn't appeal to me.  I'm not sure exactly what I was looking for, but this certainly isn't it.	1
7182	A1ZSMMDPGBUXA6	Great ways to add not only flavor to your water, but also beneficial vitamins and minerals. Thank you for such a simple but effective idea.	3
7183	A1JTBXQFSPC8DN	I love Abbie's books. I haven't read one that I didn't enjoy.  Start with the first book and enjoy the series.	3
7184	A3RJ8P4EQ1OYJ3	What a lovely way to spend a couple of hours. Funny how I always manage to peg the killer right from the start.	3
7185	A2Z7GCH8EENZ5N	Loved Seven Folds of Winter.  Great range of books in collection to tempt further purchases.  Please proof-read author's books better.	2
7186	A18SI9WL6DKDKG	This was a great story! Sometimes annoying, but in the end it works! I recommend this book! Especially if you want happily ever after!	3
7187	APE86CFD0GSKO	Part of a saga, but stand-alone to be complete.  This story captured me and I was happy to be reading it.  Twists and turns and true love.	3
7188	A2400K1MK7ZKVU	Very well written short story.  Liliana has a good concept on erotic type stories.  I had my blood pumping.  I would like to read more of her stories.	3
7189	A1OJ3G5TH883QS	This is a book about Oxford and not a learning tool unless you want to learn about Oxford. Thanks but no thanks.	0
7190	A3RHWZ47702BET	From mystery, romance and comedy you can't beat this deal. Fun story lines that keep your interest without spending too much time.	3
7191	A32AUTWA8MM81K	Wendy you need to get writing.  I like the romance!  I really appreciated the characters!  The romance was a lot of fun.  Now write some more!	3
7192	ACZ3C2KXYQMVW	I'm sure it's a lovely story. Of course, since only the covers and about 10,000 blank pages showed up, I really wouldn't know.	0
7193	A1TVPR3547GOZV	I love this series, It is well worth the read. Such a great rainy afternoon read! Each edition gets better and better!	3
7194	A22IV5UBMWEKWE	what a poor excuse for romance/eroticism and the ending really sucks.  Will not read anything by Lissa Matthews again.  Hoped for better	0
7195	A2W1JWJRZHNJMI	Short and funny story.  It's been refreshing reading a book with no sex, boy girl crush or first love angst in it.I enjoy the sarcasm very much.	3
7196	A27X60SS04R7B0	The title speaks for itself, I never finished the book started to get a little bored and that was it, over.	1
7197	A2J11MQRHN1GQB	Passion, passsion, this book will tear into your soul from the beginning to the end.  Anyone whoever envision a soulmate or have one will love this book.	3
7198	A2Z2M34VUWGLSM	This really doesn't &#34;accelerate&#34; charging whatsoever. I wish I hadn't spent that much money on a charger I could have gotten at the gas station for $10.	0
7199	A2FWJFXXCCRO8R	Basic recipes to get you started making your own soup.  Makes it easy to control all the factors you may have in your diet.	3
7200	A2H6Y4D22HLQ8E	Timely. After hearing many vague stories about priests abusing children, it was good to read specifics. A little slow. at the beginning.	3
7201	A2IFWZS0QONSWB	I love a good cowboy story and this one is. I've never read anything from this author before but I'm surely going to read the rest of the series.	2
7202	A14NDW1QYR2LWW	It was okay for a prequel but when a book is short there is not much time to develop the plot and that takes away from the story.	2
7203	A31HX6EF638KR	I deleted this one from my Kindle long before I got more than a few pages into the book. Couldn't tolerate the language.	1
7204	A1G2GCRY91SKM7	This is a beautiful modern story about people who if it was not for some friends help maybe never could have been together. I enjoyed it.	3
7205	A1Q5ZFMWQ6X9C3	This book is really great, Magnus Bane is fabulous and he knows it! This time he helps Marie Antoinette and rides in a balloon.	3

7208	A4SI7Z4XOTI2	Good read,too short....	2
7209	A1E2TNHQ37RO45	I thought this novel was quite different and yet enjoyable. I felt that it kept to a plot and story as well as introduced the characters lovely. Well done!	2
7210	A2SE723F6ZP7PX	Whatever possessed you to write this book?????  Not a particularly good read.  Jumps around too much.  Takes you in too many different directions so you get confused.	2
7211	A1JYU0PF07KNBZ	i loved the ending.  the concept and story allowed me to enjoy a weekend of reading but i think i read the ending about 3 times	3
7212	AGB5PQKNX6DB8	Boring read a third and just cannot force myself to go further main character seems more like age ten then a college student .	0
7213	A2KOHFCY43BX98	Levine is a fairly good PI. gotta story with a cast of characters. I enjoyed this book from start to finish. looking forward too another one soon.	3
7214	A1E7P3X7NZMMT4	Hard book for me to follow.  Maybe I am not into  so-called weirdness!!!!  Not my cup of tea at all	2
7215	A1OPQI914BQGKJ	This was a pretty good book. Well edited.  I really wanted to continue reading in one sitting because it held my interest with twists of plot.	3

7220	A2VXSQHJWZAQGY	This was a quick easy read and I loved Domenico. I really had a problem with the h as she was seriously irritating.	2
7221	A1RI9BU3VVWQBP	A great read for the romantic at heart. The hero has &#34;drooling&#34; quality from start to finish. Many female readers will wish to trade places with the heroine.	3
7222	A3Q1BJNXYH6W43	The book kept you interested just to see what would happen next. Bad luck to great fortune. The book is a quick read.	3
7223	A3BWMUS975AGO	I really enjoyed the book and the characters were cute together but I'm glad that this was not the next book but it was nice to see a different perspective	3

7225	AKRUM53ZRQG1D	I liked this story.  I've never read anything by the author but it was a good story for the price and the ending was nice.  No cliffhangers!	2
7226	AN8SW1NBJTK1D	Just a poor imitation of someone else's work. I only got it because it was free. There's no story here. Try  Melody Ann's : the billionaire wins the game!	0

7228	A3Q6LH3YX5H41P	I was turned off by the bad grammar, punctuation, language, which made it hard for me to get through.  Other than that, the story wasn't bad.	2
7229	AZU3S0NW82YYJ	Enjoyed the kindle short version of a Jack Reacher  novel telling his youthful history. It gives some background for his adult stories	3
7230	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This book was a good steamy romance story. I liked the story as well as the romance and steam in the book.	3
7231	AKS7FLM2NL4HH	I don't consider him at the top of the thriller list but I have read 3 of his books and they are entertaining enough to recommend them.	3

7233	A30N2Z8OVGMU2Y	Insanely twisted!  You will never look at your favorite fairy tales again!  Who's good..who's bad...who knows!  Sometimes hard to keep everything straight in your mind but it's worth it.	3

7239	A3DQU9H0AN61Q6	I found this to be a very interesting story it had laugh out loud parts and it had a very good story line with a surprise ending	3
7240	A1VAWJAQD6CK5C	It was a great book that contained adventure, intrigue, love and mystery.  I would have given it  5 stars had it not contained typos.	3
7241	ASD3WAMBIFZ62	This book is vulgar to the max, very graphic, but so humorous that you have to like it.  It's believable while being totally ridiculous.	3
7242	A1ANG1191JS7J1	I found this book just too unbelievable. The guy really likes this girl, but gets suckered into marrying so girl he had a one night stand with. Nah! No thanks!	1

7248	A2JJQBYRYZLT33	I really liked this novella. It was maybe a little bit to short to pay 2.99 for, but omg it was hot!	3
7249	A69QZVR26U6OU	Perfect way to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon. Engaging, likeable characters make up for the slightly too predictable storyline. But who really cares? It's still a delicious treat!	3
7250	A18Z5XACCNMUVE	Savage had a promising start, but it degenerated into an African travelogue complete with tribal politics and warlords. The worst part was there was no payoff at the end.	1
7251	AC10HRTVBXZLI	Jenn Roseton books are easy to read, modern love stories without to much sex. Read it you might enjoy it as much as I did.	3

7263	AHTX4TWG3AMZA	still like the idea its fans just throwing one word ideas out and have the author create a short story.  Maybe schools should do this for lit classes.	3

7270	A1LBQ0QBA1MTEZ	Fun story with likeable characters.  Captures the flavor of the islands people, towns and parks.  The mystery provides a plot line that grabs your attention.	3

7277	A1ZF0TWXRB2BAK	Not a bad story. It didn't really suck you in. I don't really remember much from the story.  I wasn't that impressed. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.	2

7308	A2PG540OXWYFFF	Interesting. But a bit too much going back and forth. Not enough actual archeology.  But there was a lot of battle field action. If you like that sort of stuff.	2
7309	A3AASA1Q9HIYQ0	Thank goodness Korrin came to her damn senses. She was struck by the sex and not love. I would have bounced since the gun shot!	3

7319	A1MD81WRGLZ4YH	To say of an erotic story that it is unexciting is to damn it completely.  I found myself uninterested either in Elizabeth or the people who wanted to bind her.	0
7320	AAORBRZ0B9GXY	Good characters, fun plot. Loved the main character Tubby, very human and realistic.  Loved that it took place in New Orleans.	3

7326	A3BU2XJNEHB3D	This novella basically wraps up the Tristan Stone series.  It puts  a period on the story and gives fans of the series a little something extra.	2

7335	A20R37WRPLUM1D	Interesting story line, and good character development. As the characters are introduced, they don't seem to be compatible. It was enjoyable to see the story weave them together.	2
7336	AJZ51LUUYI7W1	Nicely written - loved the non-clinical, to-the-point tips.  Encourages women to be a pleaser, please herself and please her partner.  Short 23 page book.	3

7346	A1S663SQZGPF1F	To Satin and Steel which is an outstanding read.  I suggest this book for anyone who has an interest in Sons Of Anarchy or motorcyle clubs in general.	3
7347	A1BOGJ99CXON09	I got halfway through the book and then gave up. Maybe it is the writing style, or the fact that the story jumped around a lot. Anyways, not for me.	2
7348	A26W1UX7E3AW3J	So far I was unsure if I would stick with this series. After this book I was sure I would finish it. It is really good. I love River!	3
7349	A17STHT77BOL1B	A good quick read, realistic yet quite unique. A simple romance easily read in one sitting. It could've easily been made longer but then would loose its simplicity.	3

7353	A28DGIIMGV5U0H	Just as thrilling as the first 3 books, these last 3 draw you deeper into the story, leaving you hungry for the next one	3
7354	A8TYJ5P6HQMQI	a good reference for when I have more morning time and want a healthy, or not so healthy, drink for breakfast or brunch.	2
7355	A1DS7PKAQEUU95	An action packed read. A little dark and violent . But Im into all that Law and Order SVU stuff. It also has the knight in shinning  Stryder.	3

7357	AOI88UAMPBC1G	Good quick read. Characters were good with action and adventure. Some very funny parts. Definitely a different twist to the storyline.	3

7360	AMYTL79JMGQ6D	Lots of good information, and recipes. Highly recommend.	3
7361	A2N34HVF9KT57M	This is my least favorite of the books which the author kind of acknowledges this book was an accident in a note at the end of the book.	2
7362	AS3R3FWL2Y7DF	This told the full story of an incident in a longer novel.  I liked it and would read it in its entirety.	2
7363	AKW4H0JUNI5FW	I dont have anything to say but it was ok. i wont say the book was bad but i will say I am not interested in the part two.	2
7364	A3MSI4YLWOJNM4	Sweet romance, good characters, and an interesting story line.  I liked the story, but I can't say I loved it.	3
7365	ATXP34MCBFMP7	I read this for school because I had to write a paper comparing Buddhism in China versus Japan.  It was interesting, but not something I would seek out &#34;just because&#34;.	2
7366	AJHU0ZCD7OO7Q	I enjoyed this story, although it was predictable. It is a nice summer read. I plan on reading the next book in the series.	2
7367	A2M2F9EJW50CA4	I hate to think anything like this could actually happen.Well written and accurate in details.Can we have more?	3
7368	AQVURMQUQ8LTQ	As an experienced cook there wasn't much that was new for me but it would be good for a beginner.	2
7369	A26GJ51TMVQA0C	I didn't 't like this one (too many self-indulgent details).  The writing techniques were good; it's not a page turner for me thou.	1
7370	A32HU9CVJTZL6G	The pictures in this book are just adorable.  Do Labrador Retriever puppies ever take a bad picture?  The writing is warm, though the story line seemed a little unrealistic.	2
7371	A1SZM7QPOH29Y3	This was a good book I can't wait to read more from this series I only wish it was a little longer	2

7375	A2Y8AO68L3431A	I  enjoy reading a good western from time to time. My first Jeb TAylor series and I 'll probable read the second book. Humorous  and entertaining throughout.	2
7376	A2BN68GSQYV9TL	This was entertaining reading.  Nice change of pace.  I would read another Rachel Cane Adventure.  I like shorter faster moving stories.	3

7378	AV6SCHKGY7O7Z	I hope this is the first in a new series.  Strong warrior women in a time women were viewed as property? WONDERFUL!	3
7379	A2DBI3T0G7C1J7	Well written and enjoyable character's. easy to read. Will definitely continue to the next book. Like the lack of sexual descriptive pages.	3

7387	A3ARKK4TBOJR4T	This novel was &#34;okay&#34;. The plot and the ending was typical. There was't anything that set it apart from other romance novels.	2
7388	A1FWYH1HGGZS9L	Story started of good but writing became very mediocre batteries few chapters. The flow of story was rushed and made story become rather predictable.	1

7390	A2X954H4KMNW6W	An interesting short story written in the victims own words.  The premise could have been expanded to a more complete.  Recommended for people who like short stories.	2
7391	ABAS8FQ9FOO9F	This series was not what I thought it was even with reading other reviews. The first box set was good but then the last set was totally different.	1
7392	A2KXT8N42M5MOG	I cannot imagine traveling in the unforgiven land across this country as those brave souls of this time period had .	3
7393	AXIO51VZN815F	Told in a folksy manner and made even more appealing by the numerous photographs spread throughout. Made for a fast yet informative book for the young ones.	3
7394	AXR9872CRBWBA	Couldn't follow book well.  Just had hard time getting into it. Ending left you up in the air. Maybe next time.	2
7395	A3VX3H5KTS8FXX	It was a good book. I do feel like it took a long time too get to the climax of the book. But pretty good	3

7405	A3LYPIHW4SQCJP	Once again I was unable to put the book down. Great story line just needs be grammatically updated. Words in the wrong order or misspelled.	3
7406	A3ICQD9JCZLAT1	It started pretty good but kind of got slow. I feel that I could have spent my time more wisely. Thought this was suppose to be more amusing.	2
7407	A3DN0DYUL7M2H7	I enjoyed this book, it was humorous and entertaining. It had a brief story line, good characters and was a fun quick read.	3
7408	A3371MJVGV7QGG	This particular book was very boring. I've liked other things fom Entangled Brazen, but this was a boring plot and a waste of time.	0
7409	AIDQNO0FXMY3F	I liked this booki.  I liked the characters and the plot.  I would defintely recommend it to someone as an interesting and thrilling read.	3
7410	A20R37WRPLUM1D	Reasonable character development, though using some questionable medical science. Interesting story line, but the sex scenes were written to titillate women more than men.	1
7411	A3TVFCBJYJ1RK4	Great recipes would recommend it to anyone, best part it was free.  Recipes seem very easy to follow as well as the program.  Get it now.	3

7433	AS09YZV00HGLO	I did like this book but there were some times  felt it dragged  about things that really were not important. But for the most part it was a great book.	3
7434	A3TUDZ2V2G2J13	This was a delightful must read!! The authors writing style flows nicely and the characters are extremely likable. You will find yourself transformed in time.	3
7435	A1N2PY3PL8QA7W	Pretty cool, for the price.  Suggested for fans or those coming late to the show.  Behind the scenes stuff was neat.	2
7436	A2Q571PVNCZN62	Short and full of facts. I am from Europe and I know almost nothing about this war. This book was useful for me.	3
7437	AGF6MOOI4225M	For me, not quite as strong as the first two books but still worthwhile. I read the first three in succession, so I'll take a break before picking up #4.	3

7443	A1AFOHKCFMFGGQ	Could have been more developed.	1
7444	A22GGHISKRVAOX	An enjoyable psychological thriller taking place in the South Carolina town of Shingle Beach. Having lived win mental illness myself, I could identify with the themes.	3
7445	A30GVJS37W5QFQ	Short but interesting.	2

7455	A3OGGMB9TMTSO7	Difficult to get into,and too many French words and phrases.Too much inappropriate behavior.Not worth  wasting time reading.So. l. Skipped through it.	0
7456	A3P41LDKN1J34E	It was okay, but I skipped a lot of pages because it was so predictable.  It lacked tension.and suspense and character development was weak.	2

7459	A3KCT9YXRCCADA	She let go of her inhibitions and had a wild, free and fun time in Vegas with a total stranger. If only we all could be so free.	3
7460	ASU6X9MAKMBGT	It had a slow going but if you were patient enough you would enjoy this second book to the series!	3

7462	A150HF52WXHN36	This story seemed rushed and lacked character development. The book cover is really nice but I don't think I'll be reading more of this series if there is more	1

7469	A31X0GK7XMM59F	Not accurate.  Leads you to believe that the world is millions of years old.  The world is only 10,000 years old.  He didn't know what he was talking about.	1
7470	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Not too bad.  Predictable though.  More about the girl than the guy.  A strong female falls to a egotistical male.  Might be two and a half stars.	1
7471	A1CFG43PDL0BQ3	Very sweet story, a little predictable.  I needed something light to read and this was it!  I enjoyed it quite a bit.	3
7472	A2XKX5TBB6WV00	I liked how Kelsie tried to be positive when bad things kept happening. She really did have some bad luck during the day. Robert was such an awesome hero!	3

7476	A313K9LIUYD83F	This is a wonderful cute little story, wish he had gotten a little more graphic, but it makes for a great kids story.	2
7477	A3KR3N21N470FU	From the start, it was sexy and hot.  Although, it was too short, it did have intrigue and vampires. Will get the rest of the books.	2
7478	ANVTAWS16M5UU	It's one of those books you like from start to finish. The characters worked well together and they were believable.	3
7479	A2LIHNEOIHNHRF	One of my favorite movies is JAWS - so this sparked my interest.It was like reading a 70's disaster movie (that's a good thing)	2

7483	A1YFW0H7GCWNOX	A wonderful story about the unexpected discovery of love. I wish it had continued and explored the relationship between these two men more!	3
7484	A1OIH98KG7UJLI	A interesting book with a great plot. A great deal for the price of it , but could of ended it in a better way.	2
7485	A30K9MEPFESK61	This was an okay read but not up there with The Closer You Get that is in this same series.	2
7486	AX7ZRV05WPVK2	This is ok. The plot is decent. I felt like it had a few too many innuendos.  This is not for the faint of heart.	2
7487	AJRYPPA566O8I	It's interesting to read stories of mail order brides as each author has a different way of telling the story.	3
7488	AEW14JRR12NJT	I would Not recommend this book. Very basic writing not for a mature reading audience. Not worth a free sample!!!!!!!!	0
7489	A1C1DZJ3OSQPW6	It took me a while to get into this book but once I got into it I couldn't put it down.	3
7490	A9NCSHYMJF8XN	If hadn't made such a big deal about the sex, would've been better. Especially girl only able to have sex with guy.	3
7491	A3BHL0MQWXJ5HN	A good short story of lust and love. A bit of a Pretty Woman scenario. Would have given it 5 stars if not for the grammatical errors and misspelled words.	3
7492	A2MYA8KS254MCL	An adventurous book, good action level, characters well developed, clues subtle, interest level kept high, conclusion was well thought out and climactic.	3
7493	A36T4JVDWRHMFY	Another entertaining  book about  mail order brides. What chances these young. women took! The author has a great imagination and holds your interest.	3
7494	A1SCX99RWKY6TE	The story was ok. Kind of all over the place. Jumping here and there. The editung could definitely be done over.	2
7495	ASGYHUP51LGG2	Mild read. Was not intense as I was expecting.  Did keep my interest.  The first book was intriquing. The follow up book did not keep your attention.	2
7496	A2MPHT7EJUTRG6	An interesting basis for a story but too big for author's story telling ability.  Keep Linclb closer to home and working on more mundane cases.	2
7497	A25OI73DWGX0PA	Made me appreciate the 1st Doctor all over again. Susan isn't nearly as annoying in print! Why are  you reading this? Just buy it.	3
7498	AJL59IEBNETQ8	Loved the characters. Loved the story. Have read all the stories in the series. Will read more from this author. Love this series. A must read.	3

7500	A2NLCPHHWN6RN	I chuckled a few times but it was kind of disturbing in a gross out kind of way. Not sure if I will read the next one.	2
7501	A3R6PF7C5J7U6T	extremely short. all these shorr stories need to be combined onto one book.would not recommend buying this book at all.	0
7502	A15N0JTFGTCWP0	Strange plot and characters but interesting and is a page turner with different things going on every second of the book.	2
7503	AN69R0NJXV8ZQ	So boring and hard to understand.  Did not finish.  Would not recommend this book to anyone.  Looked good from review, but did not live up to my standards.	0
7504	A1XO3LYB42A8OL	no discussion of the varieties of dyslexia (mirrored letters, scrambled word order, etc); just a drawn out admonition to offer support and cheer the kid on.	1
7505	A2AAAZKAJ9KHHG	A chilling and very hard hitting short horror story. Definitely one that you keep thinking about for a while after reading it.	3
7506	ACMULM4LM19LN	Love the  story.....Appreciate the good clean artistry .Great JobCannot wait to get books two and three soon	2
7507	A3JRSJ7UQPUYQX	It was okay, I guess.  Used one of the basic recipes.  Probably will keep it a while and then dump it.	2
7508	A84T3MDOXA2X2	This was a fun series on a bunch of people and how there lives inter mix and how there strugels help there bond become stronger	3
7509	A1R73DNQ46RJNT	Love the continuing stories between Seth & Morgan. Hope the author is going to write stories about the rest of the Blake boys, especially Tyler & Tate.	3
7510	A36CGEO9LP8ARS	This first one hooks you for the next 2. Fortunately only a couple more days till the third one comes out.	3
7511	A1LRLSEMKTU0XJ	As a connecting book to the two am series it was really good and I enjoyed the look into one of the source bloods backgrounds.	3
7512	A2QEVUIEJ4SGQ9	This is just a written piece of sex with no story or real character development.  Not a real intriguing read.	1
7513	A1VDL9KMDQ0558	I really enjoyed this series. I hope there will be more stories in the series. Thanks for a great book.	3
7514	ANUAJ3OMUH893	Nice read, never read Sue Grafton before. Will try V for Vengence, next. Didn't really like the  other story. Maybe ask for the real book for Christmas.	3
7515	A39HYJEQWIQGHG	i found the first volume under the Surrender bound book of different authors. i like this story, that's why i followed the marriage diaries and it is well written.	3
7516	A1FXGLLR6SJ11N	This book has a pretty nice selection of chicken recipes. I would recommend this if your looking for something new to try.	3

7518	A2RAIPFSGCE2W6	I wish it was longer but it was still an ok read but like I said I wish it was longer	2
7519	A2R1IHKWRN9ZAC	Very sweet story. Ending seemed abrupt. I wish we could have seen more about maddox and haley after they got together to find out how they resolved the financial issues.	3
7520	A2K6G8EVTAWG7N	Nuttall gets better. Pretty heavily political sidenote and not so much scifi as just a dystopian world, but good, catching stuff. Not a very happy story.	3
7521	AQNTYVRJ2UHD1	I really loved this installment of the Good Time Boys Series.  It was great watching Rawley grow up.  This series continues to be interesting.	3
7522	A39JEH2M5KY1HX	Although a short story it was written well and held my attention through the thoughts and fears of the young girl.Cleverly done - I liked it.	3
7523	A4WRE9R70BB5F	This made for a good quick read. It is a very cute story line but for me it was to quick. Kelsey Allen has great potential for more.	2
7524	A2ZTY51F0BEQ9P	this is one of those books that you can sit back and enjoy, it starts out good and keeps going	3
7525	A2YW7AX0TRLNFC	This was an OK book. I would not highly recommend it. Too bad since I enjoyed the others in the series.	2
7526	A2O8R1A83EROU0	Really enjoyed this book. Lots of adventure and humour. Looking forward to the next installment of this series. Hope it's not too long of a wait.	3
7527	A3806J626559UL	Fun book to spend an evening with.  Kept my interest all the way through.Don't know why there aren't any men like that in real life.	3
7528	ANR1PDRP9690P	I deleted this after a couple of pages.  just wasn't for me.  probably fine for others, but this just didn't hold any interest.	0
7529	AA04GJTL32C7E	A quirky, fun story. I hope there is a sequel.  I want to know what happens to Etta.  Is she rescued.	3
7530	A2DRFKYOD0KEZB	I liked it because it really starts out good. But on the other hand it leaves you upset because your just starting to get into it an it ends.	3
7531	AFQZ0ZBJZESH7	Just a fast moving fun story that is heart warming! This is the second story I have read from this author and I an HOOKED!	3
7532	ACZ5QL93DM9ZY	Sorry, I just can't get into this book.  I only read a little of it and it wasn't the kind of story I like to read.	1
7533	A36ZHBPXO2B4I1	Very good story but not recommended for those under 18 yrs.  Kept my interest and it is sadly based on many true stories.	3
7534	A2I5AU5QPLCDUQ	It wasn't great literature but is was a good old western yarn. The author made good use of historical characters and events to weave his tale. Good read.	2
7535	AS09YZV00HGLO	This is truly a good clean book. Not many of those around. I really enjoyed it.wish you could find more like this.	3
7536	A3H0LOQUOHQIR	I chose this title because of the introduction.The story was very good.Could not put it down, ending  sad.	3
7537	A26V0NEACTQL8D	Thank goodness this was a free book because otherwise it would have been more than a waste of my time. I didn't even bother to finish it.	0
7538	ASS3DV42JJDQ5	All the things that make life worth living. A good example of life and all things good and the results of jealously.	3
7539	A22GHKAQRWC1WS	This was a cute story.  I'm not into romance novels, usually, but this was too &#34;sappy&#34;.  The ending left me wanting, though.	3
7540	A3OLQ2HVWHAC13	The groom series are really good. Fesity heroine, stubborn, handsome lord... let's add he is idiotic and stupid sometimes but you'll like it	3
7541	ATWG4RFX2QRO2	Interesting book and unique plot summary. A breath of fresh air from other urban novels. Looking forward to part two!	3
7542	A2UO0RIWW9RIHK	Fast read.  Good characters.  A bit unbelievable.  The geriatric &#34;Camel Club&#34;, once again comes to the rescue.  Baldacchi has become a political hack not a novelist.	2
7543	A1E5I4ZJC7ZDH6	There are quite a few cute jokes in here for readers of all ages. Get it, read it and smile	2
7544	AIEVVZW994E1C	This is the second for me from this author.  Same characters with new adventures. A short flight made to feel even shorter.	3
7545	AMBMAI3N58Q8W	The girl was plain ridiculous. Her life is in danger and she's arguing about her freedom. Stupid!  She wasn't stubborn she was  an idiot.	1
7546	A39H768V7LY1DV	An interesting and fast moving story with some what predictable characters. I found the Zen referencesdistracting and at times confussing.	2
7547	A2RHHMZ7682G5Z	Love the characters in this book. Buying next right after this review. Ending left me wanting more! Must read from beginning to end.	3
7548	A3R0SRDZ957QMY	Nice stories	3
7549	A3KGVKVGID1Z84	This was a good book that I was hoping there would be more.  I would like to have been a little more substance.	2
7550	A3CNJ988DV4P6Z	Of course you know whats going to happen when you start reading it but it was hard for me to put it down.	3
7551	AD339DWRNEQO4	This was a thought-provoking story that kept me reading till lthe end.  I will order the next one in the series!	3
7552	A1F09AD55OPH6R	I think this book was good I honestly can not remember the story line I would however like to read more from this author	2
7553	A3F8LXIHC53G1J	this book just did not do it for me.  i just could not gt my head around some of the stories just to erotic for me	0
7554	A1R7FG0H7VZ258	:(:( this book is one  I didn't like it was horrible in my opinion!!!!!! It was to describing in some parts children shouldn't read it	0
7555	A12OQZ0H8FQKMC	I wanted to like this book but gave up after the first dozen pages.  I just couldn't care enough to turn another page.	1
7556	A3PSM87FJ6GB55	Excellent book. Unable to put down.  Highly recommend reading if you like mystery and medical intrigue. Well written and highly probable story.	3
7557	A354GKU4N30ICM	All the stories in this book are connected. They flow together from the first tale to the third one. They were a good story in all.	3
7558	A5L2TT3FVGQWE	This is a good read for a lazy afternoon.  Has a good story line and the characters are interesting.  Holds your attention throughout.	3
7559	A1JF6J4BWXSFLP	I wasn't expecting that story line. This seems like it would be a good series to read. I will purchase the next book.	3
7560	A17ZT5G2OKIAD3	This book was poor and I asked myself why? I got no answer. No I didn't like it at all, rather boring.	1
7561	A2TQ7ADERTXL5L	Entertaining story.  Written from a different point of view.  It's nice to see a different not your usual hero.  Good read.  Hope the author puts out another story line.	3
7562	A25CSYWBUTQ81H	A short story told in first person from a perspective I have never seen before.  Definately not for the prudish.	3
7563	A13L54TCG4NSNO	Really disappointed in this book.  The heroine is a tall lane bryant wearing waitress. It was a turn off and I couldn't finish the book.	0
7564	A3CNWYFJPBXT2N	IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING STORYBUT HAPPENED TO THE  WITCH HUNTER SYO MANY THINGS NOT ANSWEREDWAS HALF OF STORY	3
7565	A11RCAHTZ56GR9	Really enjoy reading these short stories.  So glad my bff introduced me to Deborah Bladon's work.	3
7566	AUGRD76G2POEQ	Liked the characters in this book a lot. Ready to read the sequels.	3
7567	A30LE5102Z8DJJ	Cute short story that was totally worth the money; Im a sucker for any BBW story and this one didn't disappoint!	3
7568	AJ7XR494MS48P	This is a good read, and the characters are very well written and likeable.  I am looking forward to reading more from the laundry hag!! Recommended!	3
7569	AIH7P46RNTLFU	Would be considered a mature teen book.. liked storyline and the fact NO sexual scenes made it even better.. Well written :-)	3
7570	A3C6XPXUVC8I90	Good reading, the stories keep me interested. Not too long to be boring along with some good surprises.Hopefully more to come.Nice pasttime.	3
7571	A2X13HF4TQKM8D	Yep.  I just didn't get into this one at all.  I suppose it the inevitability of the whole thing (from the previous looks).  It's OK, just not amazing.	1
7572	A0653433291SMBQM1ZO1H	The story line has been repeated a lot in these historical novel.  There really was not anything exciting about this book.  Thank god it was free.	0
7573	A3ASQK0X38E0FR	I love the lucky harbor series.  This one was a little more difficult to hang with.  But I did really like it.	3
7574	A1YSQ63374U8VJ	I am not a professional but it seems to me that Jibrael has a comprehensive analysis of both the causes of sleep problems and many possible treatments on offer here.	3
7575	A119RA7LF54RIT	I have read the whole series and thought they were a cute, fun read.  I would recommend them all.  All of Rose Pressey's books have been just great.	3
7576	A3LKZ2CX7TQJP0	This book is ok, not great just ok. We only read it once and if my son really likes a book we read it over and over again.	2
7577	A2HRREF9F8X6KP	I enjoyed this one and was really looking forawd to Asher - but was disappointed in Asher.	2
7578	A1ELQWH2G9NY7C	Wasn't bad, but way to short. Just as it's getting interesting it stops. I really wanted to know what happened to her.	2
7579	A2KX0H6XRI1VO2	This book was okay...I didn't enjoy it as much as the others in the series. I couldn't quite relate to the main characters.	1
7580	A3VH7IZCCBYE4V	I really liked all the characters in this book and can't wait to read about the other guys. The couple in this book was great!!	3
7581	A3F32VDCU1JFZT	Great read. I was impressed. If you are looking for a cute romance with laughs then this is a book to read.	3
7582	A2LUP8B7VGTE33	The story line was ok but I wanted to read a romance novel, not a book filled with soft porn. I couldn't keep this book on my device.	0
7583	A2I7ZLCBP6LH1K	This was a quick addition to the series and a short fun read. I loved getting to see everyone again and the little glimpse of how they're all doing.	3
7584	A1HW0WEB1LNLV3	and does the job that it is suppose to but sucks that you have to buy it separately from the Kindle.	2
7585	A2E6FMT7C6ABGQ	I enjoyed reading these verses.  So many were what I needed at the time.  Will keep and read again. Thanks.	3
7586	A176GKNSG99BBI	short story--it runs fast and quick. It is an ok set-up, just not enough to get me into the series.	1
7587	A1UAZ8O7D93C03	A bit of a twist to the usual Zombie read.  I found the plight of the girls intriguing and I can't wait to see what happens to them.	3
7588	ASDTM7Q4MH38D	EXploring the worst of doing the wrong things for the right reasons. This was a quick read. I don't want to know how close this comes to truth.	3
7589	A1BA7RY6H8CRNX	This book is all about the fact that being a masculine man does not mean that you cannot be a gentle  and romantic male.	2
7590	A1CHBNT96KKZR0	So many secrets!  Two Smokin' Hot guys and Voluptuous Woman. Could love find a way to make it not so complicated?	3
7591	A1NEKN8MTYR3X8	A little slow at first. When it picked up it was a good book. Typical zombie story. I enjoyed it. Good characters. Good ending.	3
7592	A3VDV47RHL8ARG	Now real heavy on plot,  or good character development but lots of steamy sex - if that's your thing. Made me wonder if places that really exist.	2
7593	A27K6PPD26E64S	A rememberable book.  It teaches ways a kid or person can calm down once angry or provoked.  Ziger learns his lesson and a nice moral told.	3
7594	A1PCLZ8TOJOZ6V	DEFINITELY I WOULD READ THIS PLUS THE SEQUEL PLUS ANYTHING ELSE THAT KELLI WOLFE WRITES... THIS WAS A GOOD STORY I ENJOYED IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT.  GOOD STUFF!!LESE FORBES	3
7595	A26SGH9G2HJQ6H	A slow start but it was an intriguing read.  I learned a lot about the various philoshers as well.	3
7596	A3RYOS28Q6JT5O	Not exactly a native american romance. It was a little bit confusing in the begging, then got more confusing. It was very confusing at the end.	2
7597	A3361XGKYF17S3	I feel that this was a good book. However to me the ending needed more. It left me hanging will another come out	2
7598	A3VX4YIFSMZ09B	A sweet story of a widow moving past her grief.  The setting along the Oregon coast adds a lot to this book.	3
7599	A1VZPPSP0JD90X	Still very similar to Bella Jewels Hells Knight book and I have no interest in supporting an author who uses another authors story line	0
7600	A2R4P07UV12Y6J	Took a while to get in to for some reason, but enjoyable.  I would recommend it and plan to read more Hollingsworth's books.	3
7601	A3QBCD34ZSLNER	This short story lacked a real story.  I've loved all the full length Modern Witch books but this short story did not have enough story to be interesting.	2
7602	AYVI0BX70R3M6	A light book to read quickly. There is a good mix of murder and mayhem and to balance it all some romance.  Read it you will love it.	3
7603	A2C0UA7UGA1Z6Y	Fan of WWII novels and this is one of the good ones. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it; it was fast paced and very detailed.	3
7604	AQPM5PMNHIZZW	This story I felt was short and not very interesting. It lacked suspense and the dramatic and intriguing parts. It was too simple.	2
7605	AXIO51VZN815F	An impasta! Lots of amusing jokes that you'll enjoy reading together with the family, absent all the sexual crud that supposedly makes for humor these days. Good, clean fun!	3
7606	APSGMZ8QX1TG1	This book was compiled of 5 short short stories.  Sometimes they felt a little too short.  Very fast read.  Hot and steamy.	2
7607	A2LOPDR1D8VXGR	I didn't mind this book thought it good and was looking forward to the next book hoping things would turn out better	3
7608	A3361XGKYF17S3	I loved that this was continued from Outlaw. I hope there will be more to this series. Can't wait. Loved it.	3
7609	A1J0VU58Y3UGXK	wow what can i say this series is so hot  !!!!!!!!!!!lora is just amazing i am slowly getting all her books on kindle love them	3
7610	A27F3S1WQD583O	Enjoyed it liked the plot and the characters. I appreciate that it didn't drag with nonsense page fillers. I will read the next of this series.	3
7611	A57044N0412EJ	A PRETTY GOOD READ WITH A LEAD INTO THE NEXT BOOK.  I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN READING MORE OF HER BOOKS.	2
7612	A7DOO7L5NOOTT	Short but sweet. A couple things were very unbelievable, but what else do you expect in such an incredibly short story? Quick fun read.	2
7613	A3N6B9PQPJ7UG1	I loved the pace as well as the characters in this series. Stephenson has incorporated a fast paced drama about the future of our country.	3
7614	A25WT1BWV7QELJ	Really enjoying this series, not my favorite one though. An easy & enjoyable read! Can't wait for the next book to come out!	3
7615	A1DC6HCL6DA9HD	I enjoyed a new silo concept. Very good storyline. I hope you will write more adventures in this series. Thank you..	3
7616	A2UBCRHC78YZXB	This was not a typical love story.  At times it was dark and raw. But the good news is there is a great HEA. and no cliffhanger!	3
7617	A263UOJSPTGDAG	This book has some general devotions that can help anyone that is searching for the words when needed.  They are Catholic and I really liked that.	3
7618	A3I8WXPRPQ4427	Humorously written and light reading which we all need occasionally. I have the second book in this series on my Kindle	3
7619	ACNT917RKMW3M	For the read, I found this to be quite a bargain. I enjoy this type of book and was pleased I made the choice.  Good read.	3
7620	A1T7B9C5WEVXRX	I thought it was a very good book.  It was kind of crazy how many times people got caught out and about without clothes on, but was a good book.	3
7621	A2W0NH5GOJ4NIZ	serial books end up costing more than they should and have too much time between episodes. If I had known that this was one,I would never have purchased it.	0
7622	A94VC89F2L796	Not much to it and a bore, had a very hard time finishing. I actually went to other books because it had no substance and really dragged along.	1
7623	A35RA7HU3GZHAP	Wish it had more information and techniques to deal with emotions. Needed to be more in depth. Writing style could have been better. Glad it was free.	1
7624	A24JS1RSMSVKSG	A wonderful story all about second chances. One of the best i have read lately. Just beautiful. Can't wait to read more of her books!	3
7625	A3RYNXCZIDKW8M	Hubby loves girl guide cookies and now I think I can do justice by recreating recipes that might taste near enough to the real thing.	3
7626	A2U7WBWEY9LV1K	Amazing ... I can't wait to read the next book ... I wish they were a lil longer but I know it's a serial	3
7627	A3K3R6HCKKA056	This story of fantasy fulfillment is pretty well written, but the story lost me at the end. Overall, it is not bad for an erotic short.	2
7628	A3F7QT9T5NDQHZ	Another great book written by Debra Holland. Also another family living in Sweetwater Springs Montana that I got to know. I like how the families bring each other together,	3
7629	A5WD1LRTMH756	Enjoyable and fast paced, impressive for a first book. I am looking forward to the next book to come ouy	3
7630	A4JPTNRSWW8QZ	Book 1 in the Kin series was by far the best but Lacey and Joey's story was pretty sweet. Want a quick read I recommend this series.	3
7631	AMQTB85ZIF7EJ	Lisa kleypas no decepciona, sus novelas siempre son muy entretenidas con personajes creibles y queribles!!. Este es el tercero de la serie Wallflowers. Lecturas entretenidas siempre.	3
7632	A1FV0XY1YEJRS7	The plot sounded great, but the execution did not warrant reading twelve (?) books in the series.  Perhaps, if I was more invested in the characters I would have continued.	1
7633	AT7LT8IGSNBJU	It was a good book but I would have loved for it to be longer. I read too fast for these short stories.	3
7634	AS2AMJR6JJZSS	Did not find this very interesting or informing. It's all old school things that any plain Jane has done before.	0
7635	AGCUSTPYL5MW2	That was an intense 5 minutes! Great story, but I would have loved it to be longer. Much longer! It makes an excellent opening to a novel, for sure.	2
7636	A2O8R1A83EROU0	I really liked this book. Looking forward to the next installment of this author's book. If you like humor suspense and surprise, you will enjoy this one.	3
7637	AHZI10QKAQZ91	a typical short novella with the love at first site theme... nothing to write home about but if you like these kinds of books it's worth the read...	2
7638	A356RIL6BIUGHK	The book was totally hot!An easy one hour read... If you have nothing better to do.The moral of this story is don't screw around...	2
7639	A33EU1JHKVRTTK	Liked the story... the author does a good job with giving you a visual of your surroundings and takes you away, as if you are actually there.	3
7640	AC0636015NPKR	I really liked this book. it just kept going on and on and on. good story, cute love story, but it just dragged too much for me.	2
7641	A1AYGBTUQF7E8W	Perfect read if you don't want a plot--moves right into the sex without the foreplay--it's a readable porn flick-worth the price!	2
7642	A3709JUZ7Q0SIX	Really 2.5+ stars.  Not great, but not bad.  Similar story line to others, didn't hold my interest that much, and too short for the price.	2
7643	A1KNGZZONA9PD4	I was browsing the free books and found this. Good story, good writing. Action with a little love and suspense	3
7644	A1SGH9J36TR074	other than two short incomplete stories that left you hanging and made me annoyed.six more words needed for this review.	0
7645	A20BUMEC3IC3SV	This one of those must read books, you want be able to put it down. Sorry for the short review but I gotta find book two asap, must read.	2
7646	A3D739C060KEW5	It was a good story.  Some of the parts were a little ridiculous but other than that a good read .	3
7647	A18HZ530LU5F9G	Yvette always delivers. This is a good short story, it's quick and to the point but it's pretty spicy. You won't be disappointed.	3
7648	AF703M0D6NSKR	I have always enjoyed the stories and am happy for the complete collection. The stories uplift my spirits. Thank you.	3
7649	A31CULGGXLZF7U	My view on werewolves is clearly just different from the authors. I didn't even finish the book. it just felt wrong for me.	1
7650	A2FABC4AIPQ22T	This story is light and entertaining while progressing at an acceptable pace. The main characters are relatable and I look forward to the next installation...if there is one.	2
7651	A11KX05Q4ZACIO	But will read more of Ms Arnold.  The Daddy School will not win big awards,but I did enjoy the read.	3
7652	A2XSNTZ2ZE5046	Dionne moore writing is great and funny her characters keep you laughing and you just want the best for them and the whole town.	3
7653	A2KS09RAT52LKD	Can't believe I finished it already, dagnabbit. Although it left me hanging,wanting to know what happened next, I do not like short stories. I'd like a full-length novel instead.	3
7654	A2ATNLS3W4OEQO	I found this an enjoyable read, albeit the typical epic fantacy.  Leads you to invest in more than just the main character.  Look forward to book two.	3
7655	A3BMSJRTFSGHG9	It was a fun short read. I love tattooed bad boys and hot cars. It was kinda predictable but still fun read.	3
7656	A3UREXZMUCVZQW	This is a rip of HP's books,HP'S books are way better!!!! dont buy this book! The Author of this book needs to look up the meaning of Plagiarism!	0
7657	A1KH02ABCRGQY6	This book was good for a short story. Was a twist on the zombie genre including it in with the civil war but was a nice quick read.	3
7658	AJMYX6BWDEHZA	Not a whole lot of info. How to make a salad in a jar. Good ideas. The recipes looked good. I believe there are 7 recipes total.	2
7659	AHCMI8B03QE3B	Good series of short stories.  They were well developed and kept you interested in the story up to the end.  Good read.	3
7660	A3PQN0TWIUNQCK	very disjointed,i still don't know what the point was. it was a waste of time. if it was any longer i would have stopped reading it.	0
7661	A3CQP2ACRFW6E7	disappointing. hard to catching up with.laaaaaaaaaaacking.Could have been a good story, but too confusing.definitely need to be reviewed.	1
7662	A2D7DS1DGAWGVR	wish this book was longer, it gets you into it and then the next thing you know is the book is over	1
7663	A3HL3Y3V5U2896	This was a good easy read.  I have since bought the next two books in this series.  A little unbelievable, but good fun.	3
7664	A3GWE80SUGORJD	Good story about an extremely shy woman and the strong quiet man dedicated to protecting her. He has loved her for years but never let it show. Recommended read	3
7665	A1QSX4HL0AQAG5	Sometimes the stories got rather weird and in a couple of them almost(not quite) porn.  Enjoyable reading however.  Only recommended for adults.	3
7666	AM4DV1CUYYM83	This was quite a ride, Fast paced, action packed and moving.  the ending was a perfect ending for a fairytale, to bad this is real life.	3
7667	A2HFMWU3UAP16D	Very, very short, a bit predictable but still sweet.  Did make me wan to go out and get more books by this author.	3
7668	AZLOCW6YBVSLS	loved it! hilarious, sexy sweet and soo romantic. the love scenes are intense. you'll love it. i need a sequel on kindle like yesterday.	3

7670	A2CK1MI4F53HM5	enjoyed this historical romance very much.  first time i read a book by this author, but it held my attention thru the whole book.	2
7671	A1FC6HS3ZG9MXF	Short 30 min entertaining read.  Nothing unforgettable even though I'm partial to firemen stories.  Good time waster if your waiting.	3
7672	AM7A763RM1SEJ	This book along with book 1 were great!! It kept me interested and I couldn't put the book down!!! Luv'd it!!	3
7673	A35CI9B21VCKP4	Great book! Enjoyed the whole story. Didn't want to put it down. Can't wait to finish the book Midnight Secrets-Allison's story	3
7674	A2S22JPK44ILQT	Some interesting parts--not always easy to follow the plot.  With the narrative somewhat disconnected, it comes to the end before all of the angles seem to make sense.	2
7675	A2KS09RAT52LKD	Good read. Needs some proof reading, but the mistakes do not slow one down long enough to matter. Want more!	3
7676	A1VR4S6UWXDJK7	I love this story about Robert and carrie! Very inspirational and a clean Christian romance. My only thing was the price.	3
7677	A3I6WZMCTU6FOZ	This was my first exposure to a graphic story.  I expected more, especially as a fan of the 3 foreign and one domestic Larsen movies.	1
7678	A2PX0EAZ8DKP97	Very happy with this book,  many great recipes,  lots to choose from.  Eating healthy is always a plus.  You will enjoy!	2
7679	A6NVLAVXDNMIQ	It was well written, engaging and fun to read.  I reserve 5 stars for a literary masterpiece, which this fell short of.  That being said, I could read it again.	3
7680	A3EPSATLEMFL9K	Quick read..toni blake read...family dominated by the father.....Family going on a business trip.....all around the ending of a war..families changing...Not too bad.	2
7681	A27B4YL8WI7UDY	I enjoyed these two stories. It was nice having them as a combined offerring. Each one was good for a relaxing eveing at home.	3
7682	A2HQFIC8HODAB7	Not my type... I couldn't finish the book. I did not like the characters or the story line. Not for me...	1

7686	A3NOEGDSV73K7M	Somehow I thought there would be more  to the story. Girl loves tow brothers. They turn into Bears save dog from wolf. Girl is shocked.	3

7689	A3KGVKVGID1Z84	The only wish l have is for it to be longer .  A little more substance to the story line and it  would be more enjoyable.	1
7690	AA5FVX2OWISH1	Not a great story; I'm glad it was free. It passed a short wait in a queue, but that's all. There is little in the way of character development.	1
7691	A3RO0N386V9B7H	It just gets better and better...I want a full novel as these short stories are just a tease! Can't wait to read part three!!!	3

7694	ABI1V8YHNUK87	It was a good book and I would read the rest in the series and others by this author.  In fact I'm starting on another one in this series now.	3
7695	A19WBUH27FZ86R	Really didn't like this book, the storyline was fuzzy and all over the show...just nothing to draw you in to it.	0
7696	A3RDDLYO829G9G	This book was very disappointing. It was all written in a vague way and I found it boring. Sorry I do not recommend this book	0

7698	AFBLYN4LJ4UQH	BEGAN READING THE BOOK, GOT TO THE 3RD CHAPTER AND THIS WAS NOTHING THERE.  THE PAGES WERE BLANK.....UNTIL  THE LAST CHAPTER. WHAT A BUMMER.  :(	0
7699	AUF0OPKICU6D4	I don't even know if that is possible, and if it is, if it would be comfortable. But as fiction it's hot.	2
7700	A3EHF6O3W2O21P	This was an okay short story book. It would of been better if it had been more detailed as well as more interesting.	2
7701	A3JHMDPDDFUSLV	Made wolves vs born wolves is definitely something that I wouldn't have expected, but was good reading all the same. More please!	3
7702	A2B9C3FMYW18UN	I recommend this book to anyone. Great characters and move well. I couldn't put this down  until I finished it.	3
7703	A31XW1RTQ4ZG9W	I downloaded thisd book on my Kindle from Amazon.  I expected more from the book and was disappointed from the beginning to end.  I could not recommend this to anyone.	1
7704	ARYSM38RKE8DP	This book teaches safe canning methods. The information is given in an easy to follow way. Not enough recipes are included.	2
7705	A8DOVHU4V1KFW	Maybe if I had grown up in a city environment, gotten much lower grades in school, and liked drinking alcohol, maybe my rating on this book would be different ...	0
7706	A7QN3YS1SUO7G	A good quick romantic read.  The story flows smoothly and is well written.  No cliffhanger or no waiting for the next book.	3
7707	ACJGM77EQ2VS0	Again, just an okay rating.  I hate to see female leads become weak and helpless, and that seemed to happen here.	2
7708	A3E6NX0548Y3Q7	A nice collection of zombie tales to rattle your bones.  Sniper broke my heart. Can't wait to read more from Bryan James.	3
7709	AMZZ1QA0PBCVY	To short a story for avid readers of this author.  This story like his other 'short' stories leaves you unfulfilled and diappointed wanting more.	1
7710	A1PDPQGH0NI95J	It was not what I expected for a Loring book and I could not get interested in reading it.	0
7711	A2O5IGB7EQ199B	Really cute read it to my son in the womb sad it was so short tho. I would recommend it.	3

7713	A2AC0R7G71RP5C	I like these Garden Series Books. Some of the language was hard for me to relate to, but the love story was all there & I loved that.	3
7714	A39AOTEYHSY5U5	Nice family story and back story set in late 1942.  Sure would like to know if the boys survive the war	2
7715	A2M68K773E53IE	I enjoyed this book about K2.  It was fascinating reading why it actually takes so long to climb the highest peaks.  I learned quite a bit.	3
7716	AID6UQF1E6CBJ	I think the first two were outstanding, I found the third story to be rushed and kind of dull. But I highly recommend the first two .	2
7717	A2IN3RSV320MY	On to Book 2. Interesting characters are always a plus. Can not wait to see what Vampire Jack and friends will be up to now.	3
7718	A1HMUR5S6BNU1O	This book is OK , not as varied as I'd hoped, but, hey! it was free!!!I will keep it and refer to it in the future	2
7719	ACHALEIKGHKF5	"Not too bad. None of the ""hero gets the girl"" like in the Bond novels. Just pure gritty testosterone and manly will."	3
7720	AUMXY4NOYQDIX	I should have read the description better.  This book was just a little too far off of normal for me.	1
7721	A34XD3FP18OV42	This book nearly put me to sleep.  I love learning about laws of other cultures and the forerunner of our current system of laws but it was very dry.	0
7722	A2FRD2VV1X4AN2	Loved this story and the characters.  Would love to find someone in real life like these &#34;White Knights&#34;. Get it read it enjoy it	3
7723	AHLG2IWURMZNV	easy reading but would have loved more especially on the dating aspect because the book was named after dating. it left me want more	3
7724	AO46WQ0PYLNBD	Found some good recipes to use. Some are not super easy but the majority of them are pretty easy to follow and get the same results.	3
7725	A35SVIHAHI5Q9A	Entertaining!A lively plot that constantly grabs your interest making it a fun read.Somewhat a make it up as you go story, but fun!	3
7726	AYU0RPW8BXTMP	Interesting that this is exactly hOw our bodies were meant to eat. A great way to cook and live. Thanks!	2
7727	A3361XGKYF17S3	This was an ok book. I read the other book in series, and it was good too. This was my first read from Leighton Del Mia.	2
7728	A1K4FHAPVKMN3Q	This is a strictly Christian romance. If I had known I wouldn't have gotten it. Just not my type of read. What is chocolate tea also?	0
7729	ANF3BKUMVZEDK	It's a good story.A long written story. I tried reading other stories by this author, I just couldn't get into the story.	2
7730	A1IR0BQWGOPBAN	Enjoyable short story with reasonable character behavior and action scenes. I will probably read the next in this series eventually	3
7731	AR86MLCPMEW4U	Good story line although very churchy. Good writer and I guess the message is a pretty good one so far.	3
7732	A1A5OOT8748MV6	This book was a very good read. There were even times it was very hard to put down. Would recommend for mature readers.	3
7733	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	Couldn't finish	2
7734	A1OIH98KG7UJLI	His forever Valentine is not a bad story and am glad I bought it but it does not hold up to the her other books it goes in a circle	1
7735	A17ZBUN72H7TN	This was a new author for me.  I like to try and read someone new whenever I can, but this was a disappointment I wouldn't recommend this one.	1
7736	A2E1998BNU4FX6	I read the whole book, but I  did not like this book at all.  Maybe it's just not my kind of book.	0
7737	A3AC171A213KZW	Good book. Every second of every minute in a relationship counts. You have to put work and effort into any relationship for it to grow.	3
7738	A3NULASL86NF05	Okay it's good I book I couldn't put it down read it in one day just hope you all enjoy it	2
7739	A1YQFOJ4AD3ZE8	Good.  Fast paced. Lead character is mature and forceful.  I will definitely read more of these novels and watch for the growth of these characters.	3
7740	A24RY39KA1P8K0	I felt like so much of this novella was about physical attraction and it could have had a lot more depth. I just didn't really enjoy reading it.	1
7741	A1FV0SX13TWVXQ	It was another one of those that I started and never finished because I didn't care for it.  Not my cup of tea	1
7742	A1M0WOKA4YA27N	A bitter disappointment for Nina leads to a surprising development with Marco. I can't wait to see what happens next!	3
7743	ABU3QMQNPTVID	This was a pretty good book. I just feel as though it didn't have enough of a back story. I wanted more...	2
7744	A1MD81WRGLZ4YH	Absurd that a raft of minor American literature is chosen over some of the better work of English writing writers.	1
7745	A25RLM72241Q2F	It works fine.  I have no idea how it compares to other adapters.  That is a job for Consumer Reports.	2
7746	ASF5QW7CNS6W9	For those who enjoy the paranormal, Animal Heat, will be an entertaining read.I also enjoyed the chapter illustrations from the 3rd chapter on.	2
7747	A1QFYFKYCIXTNV	This was just ok. It didn't really add anything to the series for me. The price was cheap but overall I could have lived without it.	2
7748	A3UMFC68VVMS0C	great read loved the box set entreating stories all easy to read and well written. gives you wanting more. GREAT	3
7749	A1YRKF1H43ORTR	These recipes sound delicious!  I can't wait to try these!  They have also given me many ideas of my own for dinner creations.	3
7750	ACR63CG4ISVFP	Try Me by Olivia CunningAll 12 chapters were jam packed with hot sex, funny one liners and enough character details to make me look forward to the next story.	3
7751	AWL4JETCKBJXU	Short and very abrubt ending.  Hard to believe the ending.  Just skip this and read the titanic one it's much better.	3
7752	A2OGI3IIY0NJNK	Great quick read. I wish it was longer. The author was very descriptive and the story left me wanting more. Give me more, please.	3
7753	A3I750Q7Z2KW5Q	A filler, no development to the ongoing story. Getting tired of Tilly's thought processes and her &#34;relationship&#34; with Heller.  Which is stagnant.	1
7754	A2T7K241J2KKE2	Enjoy this book, would  recommend.  In the beginning  the romance  dragged, but the chemistry between  them  and the friendship  was great	3
7755	A2JXJAMMZU60VQ	I've read about every Vampire for hire book Rain has written. I really like the plot lines and the premise of the stories. I	3
7756	A254WC53JQLRSA	This book was every entertaining.  I can't wait to see what happens in the second book.  Was she caught? Did they hook up again?  I must know.	3
7757	A2KYVW9QZM72BM	Lots of twists and turns keeps this book interesting.  The main character is not overconfident and has doubts, thus making him seem more realistic.	2
7758	A3760GFSHUW2ON	I love this series.  Cool planet the author created for the main story of this book.  Sexy book.  Anything this author writes is good.	3
7759	AESVCOFWLC3OH	As usual Elizabeth Lennox delivers a great story with interesting characters who you want to see happy and together. Can't wait to see what she does next	3
7760	A1NLTTS6EO3DSK	This book had a few good recipes,however, not many new ideas.  I would have liked more recipes less house ware info.	2
7761	A2Y9A8RR4CAQIX	I like everything Michael Connelly writes. I'm glad he is putting out singles. More writers should do that. I enjoyed the preview of his next novel.	3
7762	A16A9WJB13VUM4	It's a great story concept, and I really like how the characters interact throughout. The ending (SPOILER-ish) is a good joke, but isn't very satisfying.	2
7763	A21TYX363P1514	its just common sense on how to memorize any thing and that seems to be repetition which i already do.	2
7764	A2OALV46QW6UL8	I did find the receipies a little complicated.  I will try them slowly. Every on I have tried so far tasted good.	3
7765	A2LG7JDZ91KZJL	Enjoyed the history of Columbus' trip to the Carribean. The aurther told a good story. If things happened as written... I am very sorry we valued life so little.	3
7766	A20R37WRPLUM1D	No story, just sex. It's very descriptive and rather boring in the sameness of it all. No character development and no evidence of love between the MCs, just frequent sex.	0
7767	A8L8U6N8J2QSH	Cute and sweet. Nice to see the geek get the girl.  Recommend for anyone who was ever picked on in high school.	3

7769	A2IXV49Z9F3UC5	The book was good and entertaining, but the ending left a lot open and could have been better.  Overall Ms. Miller's books are good.	2
7770	A2YZBJ5Y3HQ1V4	Many of these programs can be found by using some Google-fu and patience. I did find some software with looking into though.	3

7772	A2Q95CRI8CONPE	Great quickie book. Short sweet and to the point. Good for a free read. Might even try reading it again.	2

7781	A2IP5GML8NQ16Y	overall a decent read....did not care for how the couple met....but the book got better as it went  along...........it says that I need 1 more word for this review	2
7782	A8JMNBNYLP094	Poor writing. Weak ideas.	0
7783	AHF5R86S1Y6YK	If you're not into really hard core erotic fiction like me, this book is a perfect read.  I can't wait for part 2.	3
7784	A9G8WG4SJ0CVT	I found the characters uninteresting and gave up on it. What I did read I found boring and generated no intrest in continuing.	1
7785	A1HBWSGJUKIG8R	The book was okay not great a good quick read. I liked Bryson and baya but I didn't love there characters	2
7786	A1CEHD84OPNFMB	I found I enjoyed reading this book and when I had other things to do looked forward to getting back to reading it again.	3
7787	A35PV55VZ90DGP	Don't like the bad language - it could have been a fun read but the first part was just too silly.	1
7788	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	The story was good, the characters were well developed. It was an okay read tho I might think twice before purchasing another from this author.	2

7795	ADS0HUI9203P	A GREAT BOOK FOR A QUICK READ WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING INTO A LARGE VERSIOON. COTTON MALONE IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING.	2

7797	A3BC4Y1076DX58	Very informative with web links. Also gives the different ways you can watch your shows without being a slave to the satellite or cable companies.	3
7798	A1VL7DVSISLBCH	I couldn't put this one down. Lots of action and not just the steamy kind. This is a must read!!	3

7803	A28REJAM6899K8	This was very passionate and yet steamy. I have never read something like this but it definitely had romance. The love shown was commendable.	3
7804	A3TYJ2S73KS7MP	Overall enjoyable, good character development. Had some difficulty with the author taking some liberties using tech without more explanation, but it still worked. Would definitely like to see a sequel!	3
7805	A1C4FWEL3GVHD0	Life was wasted in this story. All those years wasted. Why show himself after all those years of hiding out.	3
7806	A19QW89NCQ3W15	This book got better as it went along. It was a good read but not great. It didn't take long to read and had some good sex scenes	3

7814	A2GWMT8WJONDKP	The main female character was always angry, the stereotypical black women and the plot was flat. I got bored quickly and just stopped reading.	1
7815	A3366PJTB0ZTRH	This was an OK read.  Hopefully the 2nd installment is better.  So I won't give up on the writers.  ...	1

7820	AM8HWHNI717U4	This book has quite a mix -- there is mystery, intrigue, real gentleman, and smart female characters.  A very good story.	3
7821	A2KXOZ6DKHONWC	I read book #2 before #1 bit it didn't matter, both books, and the characters are comprehensive enough to stand alone.	3
7822	AW4SO31RJ6P3D	This book is getting better and better to read and I can't wait to read the continuing story. I recommend this series of books to readers.	3
7823	AZQSQSF2QI02F	It needs a little editing for typos. I'm looking forward toreading the last installment. The timeline was a little confusing	3
7824	A30411QNHGSW5Y	I came for the paranormal and wasn't disappointed in that respect. I could have done without the danger and intrigue but it was done okay.	3
7825	A3MW4FCZFS6HUZ	I like a story that can surprise me, and while I enjoyed the characters the storyline overall left me wishing they had been challanged to their full potential.	2
7826	A221EB78OPAF0W	A very vengeful novel wanting to belong to someone.  Easy to read and understand.  Can stop and restart and not be lost.	3
7827	A2IXFVZM10Q0FU	This was a good short story. I was pulled in almost from the start. It definitely puts a different spin on the life of a reindeer.	2
7828	ADSTKO312HFJF	This is too cute. I just wish it was a longer story. The writing is so fun and refreshing, I really really wish it was much longer.	3
7829	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	Pretty good story. It kind of made me nervous just reading it. The feeling of dread just kept building and building, then BAM! I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone.	3
7830	ASJIH2QD99T6K	Coming off tragedy and slipping into the next phase of life is so hard. But this author writes about a future many can hope for.	3
7831	A1UZUCFYYIGJ5	Great short story, well written and amusing. it falls short in being brilliant	3
7832	A1EET132V3FY0V	It was a good read.. Not too short, but it only had one sex scene. It started off steamy but started slow down. I think it could've been better.	2
7833	AEZTGDAXLO8TV	Really short quick read. The story was a little weak. But the sex was hot, although I felt it could have been more descriptive.	3
7834	A2P53J3PA5TH2O	"Hard to say I ""like"" such a dreadful subject matter, but I'm glad I read it. Impossible to understand what sick freaks some people are."	3
7835	AXITBLL9QXZY1	This novella was a great intro to the series. I found myself feeling that I knew the characters and I could feel the breeze off the water.	2
7836	AUL4D0C7D3IMH	I was very disappointed with this book .......it took you everywhere with no purpose.......David Weaver. U have and can do better than this.	1
7837	A18LI83Q1F5DKU	Good read but at this rate the series is going to cost me about 20$ and I'm not happy about that.	2
7838	A1C5PHKDPCS759	Lovely story filled with music and magic. From the beginning till the end it kept me wondering what's going to happen and who is this mysterious boy from the woods.	3
7839	A1E5313URAFTE1	A recipe book.  Some really good ones it really depends upon each individual as to what you want to try.	3
7840	A2KYITVZTSC7WN	An awaking of the sins of man against man. History should not repeat itself. We all belong to the human race	2
7841	A3CKWOBUO6E69H	Ms. Sizemore is one of my favorite writers. I enjoy everyone of her books and always look forward to new ones.	3
7842	ANSLZLWHAV73P	I actually enjoyed this series I must admit with it being free I didn't think I would. I do recommend this to all my friends and family.	3

7908	A1RQL364CTFBWL	She didn't mean to help, she meant to control and chastise but help she did. Nice story, very lovey. Worth reading.	2

7927	A2OLXX0RJZ0DCL	I was not aware that the book was short story until I relooked at the reviews etc. I did enjoy the book though.	3

7930	A3553VCPLHITWM	Obviously a quick jumble if thoughts by author. As with any of Krentz`s  works she weaves a good tale. A. Decent read for a free download but it wasn't great.	2

7934	AXWNPNXMKP48J	Great sampling of new writers. I'm excited to track down their other works. All full length books with tons of story and some very interesting characters.	3
7935	A2ADK1SRYEE79H	The world building was pretty good but man, the story was cheesey as hell.  I would not buy from this &#34;author&#34; again.	1
7936	A19UBDWCAQA67L	The book had a good topic but the editing needed lots of help. I would be embarrassed to claim this book with bad, misspelled words	2
7937	A385JGFE56KEF	A fan of Marisa Chenery, but this story left me wanting less loose ends and focus more on couple's romance.	2
7938	A2K79CQS989D51	I loved it. Had me cringing, crying, smiling, and turning pages like crazy. Not a romance for the faint of heart. It was raw, and gritty. Great change of pace.	3
7939	A3V7DWJLZK7MT7	Thought this book was going to be much better than it was. Very disappointed. The intro was the only funny part of this book that I read.	1
7940	ANZTJ9Q0XUHM8	Cute read. I liked how it had both the female and male sides of the story. Would definitely consider reading the rest of the series	3
7941	A1C2CK549H1NO1	This was very interesting. Not what I usually read, but it still managed to capture me until the end. I loved the twist at the end.	3
7942	A24TGNZZX4O8ZY	Quick read and very hard to put down.  The story flows well and is easy to read.  I recommend it to everyone.	3
7943	ADRB0VVNCTDME	During this read I almost discarded it.  It was a very strange story dealing with a supernatural plot, and I am more of a realist.	1
7944	AHCWKEWFY0B7W	Loved the historical romance and suspense. I didn't want it to end. I wish there were more books in this case.	3
7945	A3AAD6ISN11FAT	I did't care for this story. It just wasn't believable to me. I'm not sure if I would read any more books from this author.	1
7946	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	It was a good romance story. It had a romance plot with a little blush not steam. I would recommend this ebook.	3

7948	AJRYPPA566O8I	Could have been a really good story, but it was way too short. Half the book was the start of. Other books by the author	2
7949	A1I38Z7M5C1SDP	This book on canning was quite interesting. The information and instructions, though a bit repetitive, were very helpful. I could do without assistant, Bob, though.	3
7950	A20HZP3DSR4FWP	This book starts right into the grit of the story. Wasn't really sure how it was going to piece back together! Loved the Scottish dialogue.	3
7951	A22B3Y76P7NK25	This needs some serious editing. Repetitive and not very well thought out. I've read over 100 Kindle books, and this is the only one I didn't bother to finish.	0
7952	A18KON75OXBXRT	I gave a 4 rating because of the good story line. I really like Paige,Matteo, Matty, and Claudia. I would recommend this book to anyone.	3
7953	AZC4FEH89Z3OT	It was a very boring book. The tempo of the book was very slow and the plot wasn't really clear. What was the point of throwing in Shelly's story?	0
7954	A3JHMDPDDFUSLV	One dainty fairy and one hearty Lycan make an interesting contrast. Two people who need each other and are better for it.	3
7955	A2BQ0APTD9J5DC	This series was cookbook good!  With it being free did not have high expectations.  Was very surprised.  Could not stop reading them.	3

7960	A3J5NLP6L37WGV	A romantic but suspenseful story!  With a good looking serial killer, a strong, beautiful woman, a handsome, caring cop, and you've got a great thriller!	3
7961	A20FEEWRFZ6557	An interesting beginning to a series that has another part coming out later this year - I hope Charlie and Adam Joshua can make things work	3
7962	A1VV5AL3WKVOF0	I enjoyed these next three books in the series.  I can't wait to read more.  I am glad that Harriet and Higgins each get their HEAd.	3

7967	A266PSMY4WJP57	Nice blend of fantasy, romance and adventure.  Conn writes well and does a lovely job of whisking her reader away to other where and other when.	3
7968	A2U8YWPP1PYHJM	A very unusual story.  Not your typical story about heaven.  I am just as confused as Bill.  I think Weiss has a disturbed mind!	2
7969	A2LSKD2H9U8N0J	a simple romance not  much for excitement. it was an okay read, tho if one likes just the romance and no other added actions	2
7970	A219XR0N57KPQ2	Received this from Amazon to replace the original cord for my Kindle Paper white.  The original broke at the ends exposing the electric wiring.  Hope this one lasts longer.	2
7971	A3CJW2CVBML7NV	I can't believe that this just happened. Didn't see that one coming at all. I don't know what to expect next.	3
7972	A1J3WRDIB012CI	This was a fun, light quick read. I enjoyed it and if you've liked Savannah's previous works, then this one won't disappoint.	3
7973	A2GC0BMPPRG8IK	this was a cute, short read. I would have liked it longer, but this was quicker. very sweet and I will be reading more of her books.	3
7974	A191O3K6SS65N4	I got this just in case I needed it, but I haven't had to use it so far. I'm guessing that as soon as it expires, then I'll need it.	3
7975	A3PO5S4V6XU66X	This book is boring and not worth reading. I could not even finish it. I'm just really glad I got this book for free.	0
7976	A1WQ1LM7DMUMFJ	Predictable and no emotional connection for me to overlook it. Unfortunately, I have read much better books with similar themes.	1
7977	A20R37WRPLUM1D	An interesting start to what might be a good story, but this is only the beginning. A second book is advertised.	1
7978	A3095GRZW4D9OX	I read this ,and; it started out pretty good but I lost touch with it pretty quickly. Plus it was a little too short for my tastes.	2
7979	A2TC9KURETDVX7	Prequel better. Slow and aLittle boring. Alit of fillet. Just me saying.  Just couldn't get into the book very well	2
7980	A1DKQCC90FY7NX	I just could not get into this book, but it may be the best book in the world to you. Read the summary and decide for yourself.	1
7981	A2V0IOF8CYD9F8	This book was interesting and fun to read. The characters were interesting and made the book better. A great read for downtime.	2
7982	A1P44JJW47E6QN	Short story, interesting but didn't care for the ending to much. Hopefully there is another book that finishes the story.	2
7983	A3VHWAM2IM4Z6W	This was a nice book .but it was missing something. I can't put my finger on it . It was an ok read. I am not reading the next part.	2
7984	A32NOZ3NIBRWBZ	I couldn't read past page 50. Too boring for me. Luckily I got it for free, otherwise I would be really mad :)	0

7988	A1J0OP6GTZKHR9	It was charming, sweet, and still a bit sad. I wish it was longer, that way the story coud have been developed more. Will read the next installment.	2
7989	A3K2AR8R3IG2UT	Was disappointed that this was more of a recipe book than a novel.  Most was Amish recipes although I did not find them to our families taste or healthy.	2
7990	AAEQYD0N9ODHB	I did't like this little story that much. There was like nothing to it it was a sad tiny tiny book. But it was good to know what happenend	1
7991	A2AIIUWQ1TF1IP	A cute story. Ray's whimsical tale did not disappointed & captured the beauty of the season. Wishes do come true is the theme here.	2

7993	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This was an okay story. It had romance with blush but no steam. It is good for a quick read.	2
7994	A3FOVQZB84AUID	it started off as a story and left the reader completely hanging.  i get it that this is a short romance but close some of the what happens next.	1
7995	A3AYVB8J9PP38T	Overall fast past read... be prepared for hot and steamy sex scenes.	2
7996	A161H7XY4UIPQ0	It was a good book but I'd rather not have something quite so tensionfilled.  But those who do...I'd say read this one	2
7997	A23ILLE19GTILU	Okay, but glad I purchased it I enjoyed it. quirky, why do you have to have some many words in these recommendations sometime it was good is enough.	2
7998	A1UCGBDNHGKNCP	Absolutely did not like this one even though it was free. Quick read, really quick. Leaves much to be desired.	0
7999	A3V1XB430BUMYV	Cute premise, but it dragged on too long! I thought it could have ended much sooner but it didn't. I did enjoy it for awhile.	1
8000	A278WCYSSFSP47	A man discovers a woman masturbating in the open air amongst some sand dunes. Unperturbed, she continues as he watches. Then he reciprocates.  Not terrible; not great either.	2
8001	A1C1TL7Y4D7A9H	o.k. and I don't hate it. It's just so cliche that I am trying not to be sick. Maybe more by this author will help.	2
8002	A2ITGVNIOPF3NG	The beginning was a little slow, it took me a while to really get into it. Second half was much better. Great cliffhanger ending.	2
8003	A53DUDASGBTSB	I loved the book and the graphics were great. Oh The colors are beautiful. Oh....my daughter liked the book, too!	2
8004	A3LE77UKECF6VG	Bad boy actor, good girl teacher, childhood friends.One day read, sexy and endearing.I loved that no ego overpowered the others.	2
8005	AKVGJIY1QLOEX	Good story about how the vicissitudes of life can bring us to a place we never thought we'd be.  Recommended.	2
8006	A15F51ZN0AJBSR	Not really what I expected but a thrilling ride non the less. Good characters and kind of heart warming also. You will enjoy the ending!	2
8007	A1JOD6023BCP4F	I wanted something quick to read.  It was quick, and maybe I am not familiar enough with the genre, but I didn't &#34;connect&#34; with any of the characters.	2
8008	A3UJAWBZWB510Y	I enjoyed some portions of the book; however,the grammar and the spelling should have been checked more closely. some parts were unrealistic!	2
8009	AM9TX6KHF6IXD	This was just OK.  I didn't find either of the characters engaging.  The romance wasn't that believable.  I think the story needed more development, even though it is a novella.	1
8010	A2D6B2K8CM1FHG	I.d this the same review I gave to In the last book of his I just reviewed  need I say more	2
8011	A3B1I3EC3O6MXO	Don't even download.  This is not a good one.  The series itself is ok.  Just think the ball got dropped on this one.	0
8012	A3HPANTP72UGWE	This is just a reprint of her prior book Exiles Valor not cool good books but who wants two copies of the same thing.	1
8013	A2MJ03J7EHVSCI	There was a lot of information that was helpfull. Being free, it was a good buy. Try it some time.	2
8014	A2TZV9E87T66TS	All stories were good except the last one. Not my favorite. So it took getting used to.Skipped some pages to get to the end	2
8015	A3PAQE3QWKAE2N	The only reason I didn't vote one star is because I don't like the word &#34;hate&#34;. This book is super dry and boring. Sorry, gotta keep it real.	1
8016	A1IV0R68NTTCQA	This was a great post-apocalyptic take on Alice in Wonderland.  I loved the idea and how it was set up, but the story was drawn out and only ok.	2
8017	AJVL9RWT5RTMY	Not much in there to keep up one's interest. Chances are I won't remember this book for long; It's not a book that sticks with you.	2
8018	A1ZTCM54AXBQXZ	I couldn't bring myself to finish this book.  Boring story line and really boring characters.  I could care less about what happens to this group.	0
8019	A4J81TG5UVVFG	Not as in depth as I would have liked.  Also, I did not find the Amish religion or Jehovah's Witness.Margo Olson Turner, RN C, BS, Health Care Administration	1
8020	A2DXRUMI35BIHP	Okay...so I know these books are for teenagers and they are pretty cheap but almost every page has a spelling or grammatical error on it.	2
8021	A2RBO5M9NZL9P7	Love the author but didn't like the story - could not get through this one and it was even a short	1
8022	A7B4PUPRC5IEO	It's definitely full of sex.  The series has potential, as it does have a plot beyond just sex, but the first in the series was better.	2
8023	A2HF3I2XROKXO7	not too much on day today survival needs, weak on building the individuals, and a little too niave.	2
8024	A1EW6B2H7JQWMA	I just didn't connect with the storyline or the characters. Its not a bad story, I just did not enjoy it.	1
8025	A2QU72989CEE6L	same as Husband for Margaret did not get me involved in the story line took to long to and was predictable	1
8026	A8TV7DMX75ENP	This is a very funny book with suspense. It'll keep you going back th till it's finish ed . Enjoy!	2
8027	A12K5Y2SEANYW0	This may be the best story ever written..... however, I could not get interested in it. After about 25% I lost interest. Others may rave but I couldn`t recommend this.	1
8028	A1MPZ3A6XEGA3O	Glad this one was free, okay book, been awhile since I read a vampire book, I did the secret of what he was.	2
8029	A12LN1UTGCPU4R	It was ok, but didn't really hold my attention. .Just not what I was looking for.  Would not recommend to my friends.	2
8030	A1MPZ3A6XEGA3O	Short story,not enough detail, couldn't' really get into it. Ok for a free book.  Would try another by author. thx	2
8031	A34O9A5BTZN1I	Short but sweet!  There's not much else to say. Sex was OK. I'll probably read the rest of this series.	2
8032	A3J20TZH7SI8TH	Very short start to a 4-part series. I thought Jessica was an interesting character and I hope there is more of Mark in the series.	2
8033	A2DWBCW3PCK3G6	Ok story. Nice idea not sure where it is leading though. Nothing too raunchy. Not overly believable but good scene/plot/series intro. Looking forward to seeing where this one goes.	2
8034	AM5MT9SOCDV42	It has a different plot from most paranormal stories I've read. I wanted more character input. The ending left the story hanging.	2
8035	A2KGTHQPPQ5JFC	ended quickly hope another book will be coming out to continue story with more on Mia and the aplhas with pups	2
8036	A35OAZE3EWAHXG	After reading 3-4 stories they all kind of run together. There was no mystery to any of the stories, they were just lust, self doubt, hunger, more lust, pretty predictable.	2
8037	A3TUHCWWTHE7RR	Hot romance but a little boring... could use a little more story to it but for free it was fine.	2
8038	A1C7DFNSXTY09X	I really didn't like this book.I did like having his pic though.I did feel like slapping him .I'm glad he put the brakes on.	2
8039	A1TZCOVQK18UVX	An enjoyable lighthearted book. It was a fast read. I wouldn't call it a historical novel other than when the storyline took place.	2
8040	A1NH9RZ90CR5A3	So much missing... wish that the author took time to develop characters and not just paste a story together. Way too rushed.... the thought was there but did not deliver	0
8041	A2JS97Y1A15UHV	This story line is a bit far fetched and I was somewhat disappointed. Cooper has crafted the characters well and the action is fast paced but the story stretches reality.	2
8042	A2ZMUJ57V97YZ0	I like reading Stephanie Bond books, because the characters are odd and likeable.  Each story is entertaining and fun to read.	2
8043	A19DWIC1T7127Y	I didn't realize this was one of those series that are more like chapters of a book. Short with cliffhanger.  Not a fan	2
8044	AWA2IUSYNU0YV	Tried several times to finish the book, and gave up.	2
8045	A2R9B0IZF1L4VP	this book was interesting but not my cup of tea. the story was good but i like more into it than what it hadl.	2
8046	ABCC2RQZKPVTN	I loved everything about this short story except that it was a short story. The storyline was well written and the characters were interesting.	2
8047	A15NZD5WINDQZM	AM NOT A READER OF FANTASY AND THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A SHOT  NOW I KNOW THIS GENRE IS NOT FOR ME	1
8048	AJR4MLSQ82SBI	I liked this one but I am not really into lesbians and gays. Don't get me wrong, if it's what you like, then this story is definitely for you.	2
8049	AWXZ08SEPOAAO	Ok read.  It just went super fast for my taste.  For some reason I was expecting more.  That's really all I have to say, sorry.	2
8050	A29DHL122HO5UZ	The book, as some readers agreed, was a little slow and corny. I gave it a 3 for the author's effort.	2
8051	A23LX12CA3G4FG	Was looking for a good read. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't the best I have read either. Wished it was a bit longer.	2
8052	A3OGSXZ69GKY2S	The author's are way to verbose and you can't stay interested in the story. I tried and tried but couldn't even read the second book.	0
8053	A3RCGZ3M5CRQAM	Love Janet Evanoich's books so thought I would give this novel a go - an enjoyable read good holiday book	2
8054	AEWTM9BHEHDIC	I wish the book was way longer but overall I enjoyed it. It was also very predictable sad to say but true. It was an ok book	2
8055	A1HECY59KSZWZM	Had some great links to site, but I was expecting more. Had some decent tips. Looking for a clear system for working my Amazon Affiliate program account.	2
8056	A3DQ2IVFRXPT8P	I found it difficult to stick with this series.  I have read the Miss Fourtune mystery books by this author and they are far and away a better series.	2
8057	A2H5MED4JA51QL	It wasn't as good as I was hoping but I didn't hate it either. Cute little read but not interested in continuing the series.	1
8058	A2ZP12UPU3OX00	Hard to read due to the difference in languages. But interesting once I got started. Good characters loved the twist of the plot.	1
8059	A14UMWSBCNCD6L	Much to short. I do not like short stories and would not have gotten it had I realized it. But was ok for being short	2
8060	A2UZO7E35TQHIM	There are 9 recipes, as promised, but they only represent 3 kinds of Girl Scout cookies. Buyer, beware of that.	1
8061	AE9UHENJF6VGA	A great filler in  when you are waiting for that next book in your very favorite series.  It will make you laugh and that is important.	2
8062	A36KAF0AZ2ZDUH	Long winded but  a good  book	2
8063	AKR8NHQPS14UH	OK story, but had trouble following it, and couldn't stay interested thru out the hole book, Will read more of his books to see if they get better.	2
8064	A2H76J4XCC59MM	I enjoyed this book. I hope to read more about Olivia and garrick. Good read would suggest to others. Thanks	2
8065	A33H90GGA5BPS5	This is an ok read. The story line is ok. The characters are believable. An easy and quick read. The villain was not revealed until the end, which I like.	2
8066	A2P3LIKG2H56VD	No buildup, he tattoos her, then follows her home and they fall into bed together. No drama or story or anything. Writing is good as far as grammar and punctuation.	2
8067	A3GWE80SUGORJD	A fun quick read.  Nice to have the story of Jace and Claire to round out the other Brookfield stories.	2
8068	A2FQNP2CT2AHKO	Cheesy, unfunny, ridiculous jokes. The ones I did understand we're written for elementary school kids. I liked literally three out of all of the jokes.	1
8069	A3429GFYO7R6ZP	It was too hard to follow the story line.  It might have gotten better are I read further, but I could not - it just did not hold my interest.	1
8070	A3RLPYT2GMPNT8	Had a hard time keeping up with the personalities of the main characters. Think this is a book 1, would not buy book 2 whenever it appears.	1
8071	A3OZFHND05ORIB	Interesting drama spanning several different time periods. Many different stories unfold throughout. I liked it even when I had no idea where it was headed.	2
8072	A3CPOHWLDXQZ6E	I bought an ebook version and was very surprised that it was a short story. It was good, but way short.	0
8073	ALV0UIJEVXZ2G	I guess I expected something new.  Maybe I've read too many marketing books already.  I think I expected more tips	2
8074	A2HLVYIVU6VJ3X	I love the author but not this book. It lacked something in the storyline. I can't wait for book number 5 in the Dollar Out of Fifteen Cents series.	1
8075	A1V26JUXYOSEA1	A fun fast moving erotic.  Tale that is the  fastest  most enjoyable short story I 've enjoyed in  a long time.	2
8076	A2J1YURKRKJ6N6	This book definitely held my attention, but I was not entirely satisfied with the ending. A very strange book indeed.	1
8077	AYZ0UEAG98RG5	A haunted ex cop outside his bad memories to solve a complicated series of killings of homeless people. The story is sad but it's a reality of big cities today.	2
8078	A2IN4I2SN9NHVR	This story was unique and well written. Never read anything like it. But it was a little too mysterious and I didn't like the ending.	2
8079	A15N02RNGJZJNO	I agree with some of the other reviews that this doesn't seem to be well-written.  I would not read another one.	2
8080	APTITVI3ZZ3K3	Cute short story I found it enjoyable. Will check more of her books out in the future. haven't read the first one in this series probably should before this one.	2
8081	A3Q68V9VUBO3KU	The jokes were old tired and not very good. It took about 6 minutes to read out the entire book while we traveled.	2
8082	A2TZW26EATO8P6	This book was embarrassing, cheesy, and badly written. I found myself cringing at some of the verbiage. If you like the average HE-MAN takes women, then go for it.	0
8083	A12Q4IYZ0HOB0E	No my cup of tea. Not much plot or character development. Oh well, sometimes you do get what you paid for.	0
8084	A1JBUGQPRI21SU	I love the free reads that gives me a chance to sample a variety of different writer styles. I enjoyed reading this book.	2
8085	A28MYFOO3RHFKT	Much of the dialogue is wooden. Did not feel connected to the characters. I thought the cover was sexy. The story did not hold my interest.	1
8086	A3H1BG2GPDBIAI	Cute, but not well written, leaves a lot of unknowns.	2
8087	AC2E7V5O9AWVT	Some stories were thought-provoking and memorable, while others felt lacking in the imaginary department. Overall though, the collection is good.	2
8088	A8Q60M39JBOVP	I was surprised at the DEPTH of the plotline. It got into the politics & power of big business as opposed to government, reminding one of the Zeitgheist philosophies.	2
8089	A2YSYLVNBV0RZC	Nice read, but not the best of Anya Bast. The characters were nicely developed, the writing strong but not seamless.	2
8090	A39JK9SMJ8W6J3	Could not really believe the way the story went along.  Too simple and too easy how their conflicts were resolved.	1
8091	ARI36DD6M2GIX	Good read. Entertaining revenge thriller. Lots of violence but not overdone. Well written and fast moving. Not very believable though.	2
8092	A11U1MY5AGZ3FW	So far so good. Didn't grip me into wanting to put it down though. Still need to read more to see what it's like. Hopefully it would be breath taking.	2
8093	A2TL3TKAXI4C59	This book is too short & seems to have no depth. There's no storyline & leaves the reader wanting more.	1
8094	A1W2NE9H6VS47E	Fun to read, but really short... You didn't have time to really be involved as it was cut short... Not a bad read...	2
8095	A1KIKKDZ1Z49J3	The ending was incomplete. I was turning g the page for more reading and it was the end.  It could have had more story.	0
8096	ASWOTI4BLT9JZ	I first thought the story had interesting possibilities.  Possibilities were there, but confusion reigned in the reading of the story line.	1
8097	A39HYJEQWIQGHG	this is the least liked in my opinion in this series of sea breeze , maybe the story or the characters? I don't know, but I don't liked it.	1
8098	A3NETG1HBTIECA	Very predictable. The characters are underdeveloped and, for the most part, unsympathetic-te heroine is a twit and the hero is a boor.	1
8099	A3DY8HFX6UVXXI	I don't think the author knows how to write with complete sentences. The excerpt of another book provided was just awful.	0
8100	A3FWP0J7ZJPTJC	Read them in sequence otherwise you will be jumping all over the place, they do follow one another.  Easy reading	2
8101	A2QGYMSY2RI47A	I was not impressed with this book it was to slow and gave you no ending. It was not good for me.	0
8102	A111OIGJ6QSFD7	Or of the better western I have read lately.  Not all sex.  Tks Mr Bridges Keep up the good work	2
8103	A2H19TYZFH5RGY	It was ok. I was bored and took a chance. I can't say I was overly impressed or it was bad. It was just an ok MC book.	2
8104	A1NGJ0DHBG6I10	I do like this lighter version of 50 Shades of Grey, but does he not believe in using condoms or her using birth control?  Wow!	2
8105	A1U1Q1CVF0XNHK	The box set is okay.  I like Escorts the best.  The box set has two short stories.  My favorite Tina Folsom series is Scanguards.	2
8106	A26Y3WOLEBRDEF	Love Karen Robards as an author, but this was not her best work.  I did read the whole thing, but I believe that she has been works out there.	2
8107	A1QJ17BR5K3C8K	I didn't really like this book so much I did like that it had a lot of sex other than that it was too short	1
8108	A27CE3ON7T1FOC	Good story in very poor writing. Although I really want to know the author's experience, I was unable to finish it.	0
8109	A2AF9EAHQVT1FW	I'm glad this book was free because the recipes were not very good. There wasn't anything in the book that would make me want to try it.	0
8110	A3MO8JY9AQKW88	Ms. McNulty'S audience is obviously much younger than I.  The plot is simple and predictable.  The characters are lightly drawn and events extremely unlikely.  Two stars for the effort.	1
8111	A1IMRQN25R166H	This story was well-written and the characters were good, but it was thin and simple. I think it would have been better as a short story.	2
8112	ANK72JAUJNJJ6	lots of sex and alot of talking too, what was interesting is how she played him at the end.  good ending	2
8113	AD843DQ0E7T71	The book was a great read. Futuristic and science fiction all in one. It needs a secqui to tell the other teams future.	1
8114	A2ICIFYT408AON	The story line was amazing and I loved it. What kept me from giving it a 4-5 star was the ending. I found it unbelievable and was left disappointed.	2
8115	AOB0SIXDAN5R2	This book could have been a lot longer I was just getting going and it was already done but what I reD was good	1
8116	A1N2PY3PL8QA7W	Cute, simple book.  The kids were cute and the story very simple.  Needs some editing and add the recipes, especially the shellfish souffle.	2
8117	A11H2KC04C0464	Its ok, the begining is long and takes a long time to get to the point of the story but was an ok read.	2
8118	A1LZQ9C76R5BAG	Being creative sometimes requires talent. This gives you a shortcut of what you need. You'll find several useful ones, others might be too cheesy but good enough.	2
8119	AMAVWR7GSC8KZ	I read this book a while ago, however, I can remember it was slightly confusing. Ok overall with an average cliffhanger at the end. Would read book 2, if free.	2
8120	A3F4TFY7766LQO	This one has a decent storyline.  Usually these types of stories don't have much of a story to them but this one wasn't bad.	2
8121	A23CHG0B045XDF	I like the story but you get strung along with all the 3 books. No action in the first book!!	2
8122	A2HVLDVRPXFXV7	I guess this book would be okay for teenagers, for this senior citizen.... not so much.  If you are young, go for it.... otherwise go watch some grass grow...	1
8123	A2YJ8VP1SSHJ7	The perfect title for this book. So mysterious and mind boggling. I like it slot a lot and the young lady was very intriguing.	2
8124	A3GWL3KAA94OA8	What's that suppose to be? Terrible spare your time  don't waste it on these couple of pages. Sorry written ...	0
8125	A2Y1X56N8NPH8G	A typical predictable holiday story which was a waste of time and Kindle space.  Good thing it was free.  Even then I feel cheated.	0
8126	A3PBE998L2AVJO	My mind wandered as I tried to read... This was not a good set of books for me. I make no judgement on the story or character development	1
8127	A2BU8F7WVY26UA	The high  kings golden tongue is a good read a lot in a short time going on in this book	2
8128	A9NYHGUWUHEWR	This was okay, I actually skimmed thru it and ended up deleting it, because I was already familar with the items listed. I wouldn't say its a must have book.	2
8129	A2GSJ15HN2I09M	Havent been able to get involved in the plot... it is still too alien for my liking cant follow it	1
8130	A2FM2VLKVKWU8T	Not enough story development. The book seriously felt rushed. Not a gritty mc novel like they usually are. I'm actually confused by all the 5 star ratings	1
8131	A1BEF1YENP535Z	I enjoyed this story and it opened the door for more but I felt this one wasn't quite finished.I will read on and hope for more.	2
8132	A20YUQWFLCO1QM	This was an okay book. A lot of misspellings.  I've read several books on minimalism. This was not the best one.	1
8133	A3E2SKWYHRABMR	It is not even like a whole book, but a part of one.  Why bother to tease people with unfinished stories?	1
8134	A1SRV0TZIQTRJT	This was a pretty cool book I thought it would have been more exciting but I was wrong but it really was a cool book	2
8135	A2GIMHBLKVGDZF	I wished they went into both says of the story instead of just being one sided, would have loved that.	2
8136	A3D2FLC4Y6OP9A	So weird, confusing and hard to read. The entire story was unbelievable and totally didn't flow. Poorly written. Save yourself, don't do it	0
8137	ACI7S0PMJ0HZH	was not thrilled with this book very boring. It did not hold me tho I read it while sitting in a hospital visited a friend in less then 8 hours.	1
8138	A2BL4B2DKBUKF2	Not as captivating as I thought it would be. Too many loose ends, too predictable an ending. I did finish it.	1
8139	A27HAWNPSXN2Y9	Nothing really wrong with this story, but it is corny and predictable. Characters are not particularly well drawn.  Better than some	2
8140	A2L1019ZU1MEDJ	Looking forward to seeing how this series evolves :-) good platform to start hoping it gets better with each book :-)	2
8141	A1EM7CUMGSW7E4	I wasnt very impressed by these recipes at all. Some included potatoes and other foods high in carbs- disapointing really.	0
8142	A2YCTKN86EHQDV	I wasn't to keen on this book it was well written but there was just something missing it this book	2
8143	A3BKV9ZKRVMKWW	Loved love this bool very entertaining spice a must read u well love the story line chacters come to life right on paper	2
8144	A17QMTJ67OZT2D	I like Vivi wish she had a variety if women in her books not just blonde n blue eyed but it was good	2
8145	A392L7XUD12X9T	This book was ok but still am not a fan. I can't wait for the next books of Dirty Blood and Caged tho!	2
8146	A133VD7GNG3VVI	I like Murphy's work and have read most of her books, but this collection didn't engage me at all and I left off half way through.	2
8147	A3KE6OUG8OAZK4	A great read. Hot burning passion.  Love rock star reads.  The hotter the better, but a like a good story line too.  This one has it	0
8148	AM7A763RM1SEJ	This book was ok... Not great but not terrible either!! It was just lacking! I dont think if a part 2 came out Id bother with it!	2
8149	A2KPQK7MNLAOHS	nothing to get excited about. Maybe this isn't my type of genre. I love historical fiction, but the erotic got in the way.	2
8150	A1QGF5DRFHQEOR	The story was good but it was hard to understand what happening. I  don't know if I Would read other	2
8151	A2JG9IQ87QBNVX	I had some troubles getting into the book. I am sure that she is a great author just had troubles with the story line.	1
8152	A2R7C9H41T6W9S	This romance was Eh....OK. I liked the fact that it was an interracial couple and that the woman was a BBW.	2
8153	AMZ6MSMZTE04K	Just couldn't get as into Malek and Gina as the other characters.  Enjoyed the story or Brak and learning about ancients more.	2
8154	A13OKXN3F3783H	I loss interest in the story in about forty pages in.  I stopped reading it.  I doubt that I would buy another book by author.	0
8155	A3UQFQ9WGGPNO6	This was entertaining but lacked substance of any kind.  The description  made it seem like this would be a mystery of some sort.  It was not.	2
8156	A3FCGR4W58WQPA	the book was ok. kind of boring. had a hard time getting into the story line. I did like the ending.	2
8157	A1G3Q75EDEXMYL	A sweet little novella about a doctor's daughter and a long ago love. I also like the side story of Pen and Lord Kerrik.	2
8158	A3VVI4D3AAPUEL	Really enjoyed the book until it brought in Ethel then I lost interest. Book shouldn't have a cliff hanger ending not worth it.	2
8159	A1XKC29QG1HQ8O	Has a few good ideas. I won't be making much other then the food. The rest just didn't interest me.	1
8160	A1FIYGQ8WS79FJ	I liked the somewhat different angle of seduction plot.  It was steamy but not overly graphic. Lite quick read.  Enjoyable.	2
8161	A3GBHIRDZRCSNX	Still another Lizzy Ford novel that reminds me of the Amber series by Roger Zelazny.  Interesting but not a book I would treasue to own.	2
8162	A23BS90GTA9DX9	not the best story and did not really like the plot. Was an interesting read though and did not hate it.	2
8163	A2OXOA51MJG0P	It was a different kind of book than i have read before. Gave it a two star rating. Was interesting once I figured out what was going on.	0
8164	A3TTWXH6MCC8CL	DNF. Well written, but not kinky enough for my perverse tastes, I guess.  Unfortunately, I don't remember any other details about the book.	2
8165	A24H5TP8HNEKQZ	A good short, a good plot, and I liked the characters. The fist story I've read by this Author, but will read more.	2
8166	A3A24CYRR9TC77	Although this one is the best written of the series, that's not saying much. This seemed to have the most thought out plot and character development of the three...	1
8167	A1A4IOK0QXPIP8	The book came quickly.  Seems like a good book. I like Patterson.  I like to buy when the price goes down, so now I have to wait.	2
8168	A3RYNXCZIDKW8M	With so many recipes on the website, I saw nothing spectacular about these 3 recipes that would entice me to purchase.	2
8169	A2EF9Y712OLL07	Not particularly realistic and very predictable.  An okay read to pass the time.  The title is makes the story seem hotter than it actually is.	2
8170	A1C461KF9W1HWM	This one was ok. It was still very short and Crimzon is not even in this story, only Clover. This one seemed a little pointless to the series though.	2
8171	A2YNUFKQF48440	This was just an OK little short romance/mystery.  Sometimes short is good.  There weren't any real surprises in the story; you always pretty much knew how it would end.	2
8172	A1Y50TQC9BLMZD	One recipe called for bread crumbs and a lot of recipes called for almond flour. I was hoping for a book that was just coconut flour recipes.	2
8173	A3CMIEYL0TJLC2	It was short but I did like it .and now  I have wait to have money to get the next book	2
8174	AA5FVX2OWISH1	Undemanding but sweet, a total cliche of a story but well written and edited - a nice read for a cosy evening.	2
8175	A3HEG0QCOK446R	Cheap for a box set.  Some of the stories were kinda strange and left me feeling meh.  A couple good ones though.	2
8176	A27RN2BPAFBQJI	Easy to read. Good. Book. You will enjoy it as much as I did. Good night time book.... Good series	2
8177	A34TJ613HUENZX	It was acceptable.  As a big fan of Mr. Block and the Scudder series, I expected more, and the ending was rather abrupt.  Glad it was free.	2
8178	A2WTYFD5MZA0ZH	Its a slow read. Doesn't grab your attention in the first half of the book. It gets a little better in the end.	2
8179	A2076BGSWD0A7K	I don't think there's any hope here in this story. It's just sad. I suppose something like this could really happen.	2
8180	A1G7H87JKYZ4T4	Not my kind of reading.  Sorry I ordered it.  I thought I was getting a mystery thriller and didn't get very far into the read before I quite	1
8181	A14YTKAAKRI7P0	He destroys her life. Forces her to marry him and keep it a secret. Humiliated and rapes her on a daily basis and this is romance...love?	0
8182	A1GHV20HSBV5Z	Very Hot but too short of a story, it did however,get to the HOT sex part,so that was very good.	2
8183	A1FSHNIWUIUF9A	It was a good fantasy read but the ending was kind of silly but overalll a  good read but too short	2
8184	A1V26JUXYOSEA1	Much to short. The story started in the midst of what seemed to be an ongoing saga. I would like to read the first book if there is one.	2
8185	AZP7CQWQTM38M	This book has no substance, no decent story or story line. Not a book I would recommend for anybody to read.	0
8186	A217P3JX0MYHC1	I didn't even get much past the first chapter. It was boring and then started in with the witchcraft. Not what I expected from a homespun prairie type book.	0
8187	A3C2BUAFVHCP7M	Ok writing. The story line could be a little tighter but not bad for a first! Onto the second part!!	2
8188	A7BO2QI884WCE	There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book, but I have read much better novels on the holocaust.  They are out there.	1
8189	A3JUTTIFPQXJ8K	Hannah and Bryce are such a cute couple. This was a heartwarming story. I would recommend this to my friends.	2
8190	A1QS5ZQ7O81UH1	I wanted to read more about this story. I liked the main character and the back story related was interesting.	2
8191	A30DJUBLZEECSU	Great beginning, strange as there is no ending. Perhaps one must make up the story oneself with a story just starting to get interesting.	2
8192	A3GJIUTHHXQW6T	It was a fun read but it did not last long enough.  Guess I have to wait for part 2	2
8193	A3L7UT1KIYV1SR	I couldn't make myself read it beyond the first few paragraphs. Story line is jumpy and not smooth reading. Sorry Mr Nuttail	0
8194	AOJNBP93U57WH	After reading Taming Clay, I got pretty hooked on cowboy/ranch romance books. For me, this was just okay. Didn't hate it or say I loved it.	2
8195	A31OQIF4LEMG4	This was an ok book, kind of predictable. The ending felt rushed and left out some detail. I have read better books from this author.	2
8196	A12FUBWX1VK5CN	I love Terri's Mary O'Reilly stories, but this one totally left me in the dust.  I couldn't get into it at all and deleted it from my Kindle.	1
8197	A1XWFWRM3XA033	Avery entertaining book that kept you wondering what would happen next. Could also be a look into the not so distant future.	2
8198	A3QYBBQOTVHGGP	It was o k it just wasn't like the other books she writes. It just didn't  sound like her books.	2
8199	A3ND21XF8LEIT0	Sometimes a little confusing, but all in all a good read. I would recommend and look forward to the next book	2
8200	AG8IB3QLKLWK4	The author has a very hard time bringing about this story,and especially with the tale of Owuo as a beginning	0
8201	A340KGVXG5YF12	I'm still interested in finding out what happened to Ciara and where she end up. The story does seem incomplete. I hope Nick also pulls himself together.	2
8202	AHUCVX5AF4UGX	It is a good steamy book, but is too short, I would love to have more to read, now I need to find out what's next....	2
8203	A37SBQWDQ8U2L9	This is definitely not a page turner I wouldn't consider thriller either in fact I would consider it at all	0
8204	A25GGBPJI4HBRP	I thought these would be short stories...instead they were just the beginnning of other stories that just left me hanging.  A huge disappointment.	0
8205	A2BL7ADQBDA27K	Too simplistic. There were terms and thoughts no Amish would express. A hunk with kissable lips? Outright defiance. Pass thank you.	0
8206	A27GC533M5PSJW	Short but compromising, I think it needs more description and passion, but that's just me. And maybe a little bit Longer.	2
8207	AKDUR3ICJC7BD	This was an okay read. Short and readable. Not I book you can't put down but okay. I would read another book by Lucy Morgan.	2
8208	A3ROHS779VE0MQ	Story was ok but I wished story unfolded in a more exciting pace and there were layers to the villain.	2
8209	A190IDZ5VTUHJM	If you are looking for a menage story, this isn't it.  Save your money and read Nicole Edwards.  This story and character development fell flat.  Disappointed.	0
8210	A2IO6P5GC6DB4S	This book was too short. I find all the books for Kindle are condensed versions and leave out a lot of content.	2
8211	AYZ9N5I30UJ62	It started flat and never got above that as far as my likes.  Some might enjoy it however I did not!	1
8212	AFW1HLL6NHU7F	But some of the characters needed a poke to get them moving.  It seemed to drag in some places, and skim over others.	2
8213	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Really a typical story.  Probably a three star only due to the characters.  Actually a bit boring.  Hope next book is better	2
8214	A3TNXPP0Y1A1NW	This kindle book is missing huge chunks of the story and then whole pages will be repeated.  I am requesting a refund on this.....did no one proofread this book?!	0
8215	A22GGHISKRVAOX	An okay third-person novel that deals with issues such as genocide of whites in South Africa, medical marijuana, and the Second Iraq War.	2
8216	A3V5YJJZI2G2NN	Must of not been a great book cause I don't remember this one.  I have to write more cause you have to have so many words	2
8217	A3RUB0OQS8V7O9	I was looking for a western book to read,  This takes place in the 1700's.  It seems a bit of a romance as well.	2
8218	A1X5LXRF8XLXZW	Didn't like the plot.  Didn't like the character.  I would probably not read this again if it were a series.	1
8219	A3SUR0VO2R3FSA	I loved all of these books in this series, I liked the characters and how they play off of each other....well worth the read.	0
8220	A3T4VOAQP9D6NR	Juvenile, but simple and readable. Too much time spent on unreasonable sex talk. The story would have been much better without it.	2
8221	AJUKMGEOH06YK	The book was not for me. The girl in the book seemed a little too giving. It almost made me sick. Not for me.	1
8222	AOY8RTOZE5DKO	I found this book to be a great read.  Please pick up a copy for your self.  Definitely a page turner.	2
8223	A1I4NFFM9HCIXB	While this was a short read it left me  Saddend that we as women go thru  this type of stuff ! A good but horrible dose of Reality  !	2
8224	ACCK9G91T34M5	Good quick reaD. Not a bad book, a bit predictable. Not bad for a free read.Thank you for taking the time to write their story	2
8225	AGGDI4VWPPZ6J	I found this book to be too graphic for my taste.  The vending was unsatisfactory, to put it mildly. I guess cliff hangersaren't for me.	0
8226	A2V08M0E3HZPRX	I liked the characters in this story.  Of course I am cheering for Abbey.  I enjoyed this book.  Can't wait to read the next story.	2
8227	ADYQUMA7WEQ4Y	Really a three point five, but not an option.  Well written with good plot development.  Simply did not enthrall me like the other series I've been reading have.	2
8228	A1U7TF0RWSZBNI	Similar observational, easy reading style. As always interesting unique ideas, but the distance from the characters really prevents it being a massive must see what happens next page turner.	2
8229	AO9UITH08E793	Nice collection, nothing spectacular, but certainly useful! I am a reluctant &#34;griller&#34; and this motivated me to get out the grill!	2
8230	A3PLZVLEL94160	It was a good read. Though I wish it was longer, not so short. I mean it has a good story line but I wanted it to be longer...	2
8231	A1HBWSGJUKIG8R	This one was good but everything happened really quick and I did not like that. The books are to short	2
8232	A30CP62QUWE4VF	This book was ok, short. The hero was laid back and seemed very tame. Morgan had a lot of spunk while Seth was lacking it.	2
8233	A3VYOLMHJ0B48P	Although I enjoyed the story, it was poorly written, grammatically.  She needs to use more contractions.  Perhaps she should read someone else's books to learn how to write properly.	2
8234	A2OV7UQPROJVPV	It was boring.  The first three chapters were great and the last two were good.  To me it didn't rate up to all the 5 star reviews	1
8235	A1IC3EONI9JXFK	This charming short story about the power of a mother's love will make you hug your kids tighter when you sing them to sleep at night.	2
8236	A18X7R0QN44S9U	would have preferred to guess who the players were till the end. hope next book leaves more to the imagination. reminds me of The Secret Circle.	2
8237	A3HCUL4GS7QIWS	I tried to read these to my kids and they weren't having it. The layout was not appealing to either of my kids.	1
8238	A1GYBQO81BUU0	I didn't enjoy the book was disappointed and removed the book after reading 3 chapters .This is one of the few books that I have removed	0
8239	A2LG7JDZ91KZJL	After 10 pages- I deleted. Reading should be fun. You may like it. These last seven words are required.One.	0
8240	A1ROMOZ4BR4UWC	Well written, just too much romance for me. I would recommend the book to my friends that like to read romance	2
8241	A2OCFJ6XRQ8AMH	Enjoyed the first 2 more.  My kids read them too.  They enjoy them.  Not a bad series... just becomes a bit slow at times	2
8242	A1U07SY65BIA16	Approaches weight loss as the power of positive thinking. Truthfully I got half way through it and didn't finish it.	2
8243	A2T3RXOLDN51LJ	This was way too short for the storyline. I will b  looking forward to reading more about th  characters in  is book.	2
8244	A217QUZV2KHO6	Interesting to read in many ways. Some things I already knew from experience but a good read over all. I would most definitely reccommend it.	2
8245	A34T7UU3S0F8EX	This whole series is just little more than a short story, but if you like the whole mail order bride concepts, they are interesting to read.	2
8246	A3FCGR4W58WQPA	I was really enjoying the book and then it left me hanging. I hate it when I read a book like that.	2
8247	A2JNNVQBCFIDVL	Entirely to freaking short. This was a good read. But he'll nothing like stopping in the middle. Just way to short	1
8248	A15M8ECNJJY05H	Pretty decent book overall. A little unrealistic at some points. The author did a good job holding my attention. Good story line.	2
8249	A2H19TYZFH5RGY	Was not my type of book really. It was cute, too cute. Very fictional but I did read the whole book!	0
8250	A30IYW92QUOX4Q	Both books are very good. I am looking forward to reading the next book in each series. Let's go shopping.	2
8251	A85N5MTL5VD21	It was a fairly good book but it staged on for quite a while before it attracted my interest. And I don,t like snakes.	1
8252	A34HRQ4GESJ158	Love story set in the sultry sea air of the Mediterranean, it is a good read if you don't pay too much.	2
8253	A2DWZUL5EGJT27	I really liked this book it's my first time reading a book by this author looking forward to reading more full length books	2
8254	A1KNXLIXUTUY0L	The storyline, characters and dialogue was of no consequence or believable.  Too many subplots and no real substance.  Rather disappointed in the author this time.,	2
8255	A1Q7YBKE6KQ1PI	It was easy, cozy read. Likable main character. However not much mystery in it. Very predictable. At tines sounded like an Zentangle advertisement or manual. Delicious cabbage recipe a plus.	2
8256	A1KH02ABCRGQY6	downloaded this and the first one while they were free. Didn't enjoy the first so deleted this one as well.	1
8257	A414YEU57FUHJ	i got this book and it sounds good, but when i went to read it. i wasn't interested anymore.hope someone else likes it	2
8258	A1HAJ6ZYOW5HIJ	It was interesting and I read it all but it doesn't stick out to me as a must read or a book that i would read more than once.	2
8259	A2BR01CI7K7GAN	It was disappointed in the direction this story went. Kind of off the deep end . Also found MANY editing errors. Very long journey to arrive at a disappointing destination.	2
8260	A2M32AVN66PSBN	Good stuff on how Chet and Bernie came to be a team.  Other than that the story was pretty weak.	2
8261	A10CTHRWD9P9IB	Nothing new here, it's very dated, a few of them aren't too bad, but most of the 57 ways are old news.	2
8262	A2EMSMOP8Z4WCS	I usually love Loretta Chase books but this one was kind of silly I thought.  Maybe story was not filled out enough.	2
8263	A1HR6ISPABZAID	A very short short story and just a filler for the overall series. As always well written but a bit boring and repetitive.	2
8264	A31G1JP0ZCHS5L	This book had three different Christmas stories..I would have enjoyed it more if it was one long story. As I read, I wanted to know more about each story..	2
8265	A2NAUEEL94BBGG	I thought it was kind of strange, yet I continued to read it.  I kept hoping it would get better.  It didn'.	2
8266	A3SVKIAIQARDA8	By and large impractical,  but I guess it is good basic info for worst case scenario.  Can't  hurt to have info available.	2
8267	A3AVQO5BQU0645	Stories are okay. Needed to have better editing. Lots of grammatical errors and spelling errors.  Spell check would have been helpful.	2
8268	A3QQRK6RIYNUD1	Not bad for a good start on understanding what it takes to make things flow in management!	2
8269	A3L37OKQ8YTJQ5	This is a difficult task. To find twenty words to describe rubbish.Oh my goodness what can I say? Oh No. Still two more words are required.	1
8270	A3AYFYTVQ1TASF	but not much of the new ideas: it is good to have it around as a reference and to pass a knowledge to younger ones.	2
8271	A1SOVDZ5OHA00C	I liked all but one which was a little far fetched They were great for an rainy afternoon when not much else was going on	2
8272	A3QWKECMPY3BIK	Good fantasy story.  To bad I already IT in the Very Naughty Christmas.  Can't wait for Owens story. This one was a little hard to believe.	2
8273	A2WVU68D1ZEX6N	A nice quick read for a lazy weekend.  I never thought of vampires as being that invoived in everyday society. Things have changed from the Vampires of my youth. LOL	2
8274	AOC7KDO9G4YC6	This story did not make me want to read it to the end.  It did not grab me from the beginning or at the end.	2
8275	A1PLBW89YEJWSF	This book was not what I thought it would be. It had a fairly good story, but I expected it to be more about Christ's blood than about the characters.	2
8276	AD5PBM35ISJBZ	I'm stunned by what I have been reading. Love story? More like an oh my God pain, please let me die in peace kind of story.	0
8277	A1I7VZM3LCG33M	First two books mildly interesting; the third much less so.  Plot unbelievable, characters also.  Christian theme, so no explicit sex.	1
8278	A2CA1GQ8H3E9I3	Was a real good book wish it had more details and was longer. More information on the characters would have been better.	2
8279	A29OYPJWWVK03I	A quick, light read. Familiar story line with a familiar ending. Characters are sketched in, not crafted but believable enough. Some typos and formatting issues.	2
8280	A18MG1GPSEAPE9	definitly not something i high recommend... i bought for the artwork no more no less.  and writing review in so many words are silly	2
8281	A1OD01Q1VCWR9Y	Basic smoothy recipes, good for someone who is inexperienced with creating smoothies and needs some direction for ideas and putting it all together.	2
8282	A2EMVCFRNL0BPL	Was new to the Kindle and didn't realize some free books provided only a few chapters.  Might have rated it better if I could have read a little more.	2
8283	A9H1YQ2PW2GDU	It was okay but not what I expected.  I loved the way Dash welcomed  the girl into his life. Just seemed like there should have been more to the story.	2
8284	A151UFMNIBGK2G	Read one of the first of this series to come out.  Was a great book.  Don't waste time or money on this one.	1
8285	A2SNBE0V3F5HII	Not what I was looking for....not in depth enough for me. It's basically throws  what's in the bible out there no teaching or inspiration behind it	2
8286	A2Y34UXN15L6FZ	I thought the book dragged as far as the plot. I finished it but not because it was exciting .	2
8287	A373YV2EH338N4	I've been disappointed with last few novels in the series, and this novella wasn't much better.  Nothing about the story was a surprise.	0
8288	A1WIDTO69N3GCP	Hot, short & kinda like any other obscenely loved hot millionaire character out there. Oh and there is NO WAY I'm paying $2.99 for book 2, a 78 page read......	1
8289	A3KBPAIX2RNJEI	Good love story but way to short.  Has a good plot and a very good ending for the kitty and the girl	2
8290	A15BNYZEJ78T0Q	Not bad but not as good as her much later books the sex seems to dominate in her early books ,the story itself is secondary like I said not bad	2
8291	A36OQ45P8W6IYE	How many times can the world end with a plague. At this time I am into the second phase where the humans have a chance of reclaiming the earth.	2
8292	A43YKXX0K9Y42	I read this book with an open mind and I still felt it was missing something. The book was ok but it never really grabbed my attention. Very predictable.	2
8293	A9R3B0KHAMFCA	It was ok. I was not completely board. Simple plot good flow and to the point.  I might read other books from this author.	2
8294	A3DR8SVL9M7OY8	This book is what editor's are for.Strip away the superfluous, iron out the language and what is left?A very short read.A pamphlet really.	1
8295	A3GVG9FOZVEEMG	A little too verbose for my liking, but an interesting story.  It's a teaser so you'll buy the rest of the story.	2
8296	A1O1RNF7DY4I7W	Didn't find anything in this that looked like anything my family would like at all.  Glad it was a freebie.	0
8297	A3ATDMWWSC89LV	A WEDDING STORY is an amusing story about childhood frenemies who meet at a relative's wedding and decide they love each other.	2
8298	AH9S48T46X75Y	Decent read.  May or may not buy the others.	2
8299	A1I9D4UBQ9HNL	it's okay something quick  and easy to read and it was free even hubby read it and said same thing	2
8300	A35SD76E2TSGP9	I had higher hopes for this book. I realize it's about a hundred pages but it could have had better character and story development.	1
8301	A2YW8F1T9DV4VT	I didn't find it as good as the others but it was still very enjoyable. I would probably give it almost 4 stars. Enjoy story.	2
8302	A3G6Z28R3RIMUT	Really boring.  Course, this is part of a series of books so maybe something got lost in translation.  I doubt it.	1
8303	A3I7DXA382MBTZ	Could have been better is more indepth scenes of the characters.  And too much repetitiveness of 'how she couldn't get enough of how beautiful he was'.  Really?!	2
8304	APIH99AOYBU9V	This one was also a nice read. It could of had more storyline and plot. I did enjoy the dialogue between the characters.	2
8305	A235TK05XMUJ8L	The book dragged some for me. I found myself skipping over the small talk. It was an okay book but didn't really keep my interest.	2
8306	A1X7CZ64GQBLCO	not sure what the hell is going on here... I know it says novel but seems more lick short stories. Very naught book that might go a little to far.	2
8307	ARV9ZB2OHGDLC	Here was a story that could have been really exciting, but it was really slow in its start. It did not hold my attention, so i did not finish it.	1
8308	A1D88FKTBZODGV	An insight into the life of MOther Teresa from her early years. It is worth reading just to see what all she did accomplish	2
8309	A1IM2PH58GJWIZ	Book could have done with some REAL instructions.  I also expected some 'how to' pictures and maybe a few step by step instructions.	0
8310	A1VLW6WML4E8HA	I thought this would have been longer.....ok short story...it ended to soon. It's like reading half a book....it takes about ten minutes.	0
8311	A14F73AZ9IBVXF	sort of lost. it was to short. it had good possibilities, but nothing was elaborated on enough for me to get a good feel for it.	2
8312	A12RCE3OS1KFG9	Erotic but just a short story. I was looking for a book. I was done reading it in 15 minutes.  2 chapters- give me a break.	2
8313	A2SFH8WEXRYLXQ	The premise was very promising; but, the main character's development negated the story line.  A nerd is able to physically overcome all of the bad guys.  Story became boring.	0
8314	A2WOOCV1PA7J8	I didn't like this as well as book 2- so I didn't even finish it.It just got boring quicklyfor me.Somebody's lover was great- but this one...not so much.	1
8315	A2QY9DKU46C50C	Very poor writing, no character development at all. Couldn't even finish it. It seemed the only thing that attracted them to each other was how the other looked. Very disappointing.	1
8316	A3R0VAA4YAOJX8	Fairly funny throughout, but nothing that made me laugh out loud. Decent storyline, well-written, but wish there were more of a romance angle to this predominantly mystery book.	2
8317	A3I7M8967ML5CE	It is . A good book I wish it v was longer because I'm a fast reader!! On to the next book	2
8318	A2OZ4118HAF8AY	I don't see anything special in this book. I think I used one idea. Although, for the price I shouldn't expect a lot more.	2
8319	A2F4W4P5FG9G9B	It was okay to read.  A Little short.  It was a little predictable, but it flowed pretty well.  I would recommend	2
8320	A1366NC3IZD91G	While this was something to kill the time, I could not bring myself to finish it or care about any of the characters.  It was adequate, nothing more.	1
8321	A2YJ8VP1SSHJ7	This book was crazy fun to read. Definitely feel like I want yo read the rest of their story, should be phenomenal.	2
8322	AR9Q29XY04CIO	It was a good read, i liked how it was different to most ive read, still relatable, not to crazy out there.I may read the next one. Its worth reading	2
8323	A3A90YONVVBW6G	I just didn't love it.  It bordered on abusive and I really didn't like the sharing without her permission BEFORE hand!  Just not worth my time.	1
8324	AVO7BODO8D51G	The flow and the drawings are excellent, and the action is well developed; however, the overall story is lacking in interest and importance.	0
8325	A2FYPQ85QHGT0G	A good way to teach children about bugs and cute pictures with cute and clever rhymes. My daughters both really enjoyed this book.	2
8326	AHMRENOZ4ERLJ	the book was not what i expected. although it did help pass the time until my next author publised her book.	0
8327	A2JN35BV8Z4XX9	I will only say that I lost interest after 1st chapter, try it, you might like it if your interests are different than mine.	2
8328	A98IHDTFAB453	hoping to find a single gem in this roughly written story.  I never found it.  Editing was bad, and I guess I'm just not into werewolves.	0
8329	A1FJLL21HKTYLM	Good book kind of slutty. If I want a book that  holds nothing for the imagination back this is one to get	2
8330	AE58P91NU14LP	Didn't love the story on this one. Got a little bored.  The characters were so so.  Didn't feel the romance build between the 2 main characters.	2
8331	A18T6ZV7MC27TJ	These was good books but shortened versions from what I could tell. They went right in and got to the points.	2
8332	A5AXXYB8Z1ZXN	It was a nice,  easy read.  Nothing super exciting or life changing.  Very simple and nice,  liked the characters.  Not bad,  not great,  just nice.	2
8333	A8SDWUN6KTZMZ	Too simple, little plot and no real character development.  Somewhat pious.  The story needing fleshing out.  Not even a good beach read.	1
8334	A3CKWOBUO6E69H	It was an incomplete story. Once the deed was completed, the men just disappeared. There is no character for the men (beast) in the story.	0
8335	A3QJY01AFZXROT	One star is adequate to fully explain what this bit did for me.  Had a half star been available as an option, I would have chosen it.	0
8336	A350Y4L5YNOUDP	I don't like books about cheating it doesnt matter that this was written decent I didnt like any of the characters and the so called hero of this was slime.	0
8337	A1BUVOGGFTGMBN	Both the pictures and the story are incredibly boring. Nothing at all to keep a three year old interested in this story. Just glad it was free.	0
8338	A1J4R1KZOQGOHZ	I like these little romps to take the edge off between much longer more emotionally involved books.  They fill the void.	2
8339	ARVN62Z85XT7E	Not anywhere near true &#34;medical&#34; thriller status but a fun read.Please do us a favor and don't drag it out any  further. Let it end.	2
8340	A10TTS5EDIDQK7	I guess i'm more of story line kinda a person, but i think there should have been more telling of the character actual thoughts, instead of a little girl perspective.	2
8341	A5LFUP3U9FE9T	I didn't think that the story flowed. I just could buy into it and since it was a short story I felt the characters were not fleshed out well enough.	1
8342	A2AIIUWQ1TF1IP	Great effort! The first book in the series was delightful. The other two were okay. Regina Duke has a lot to say and says it in a very distinctive voice.	2
8343	A7PXDJVDK04HG	I thought the story was good but could have given a bit more. I am looking forward to the 10th mystery, Mary and everyone's great characters.	2
8344	A3DQU9H0AN61Q6	I did not care for this book very much it was not the type of book that I am use to readying	1
8345	A2Q1Y55V9KERE9	I loved this book - loved Nick as the Assassin!  Why oh, why did Ms Ward end change him?  Totally destroyed my biz that I was getting from Nick.	2
8346	A1M7QEPN9RKGJL	Good short story! But a too be continued in the middle of the story..... I gave it two stars because the author needs to know when to end a book!!!!	1
8347	A2OALV46QW6UL8	I am a little more bqsic in approach  ......  this is going to tke a bit of experimentation.  Some receipies were a little to intricate for me.	2
8348	A1BSXW4YC0Q35U	It was really different than what I expected.  It was okay but I have read a better selection of her books.	2
8349	A2UIFEG5D7UDIJ	I soooooo wanted to love this trilogy. I had such hope, but alas whaaaa whaaaaa. Couldn't do it and am just really disappointed.	0
8350	A31K93JWWNEMAJ	I have had this book for quite some time it was just ok. I also purchased part two so i will begin reading that now	2
8351	APUZJXWSCC0O1	I normally like cheesy cute romances, but this was too much even for me.  I can't recommend it to anybody, Colleen Coble really disappointed me with this one.	1
8352	A4WKS8YXFJGUJ	This book needed to be longer and with more details. It was lacking in substance. Very basic and without style.	2
8353	A3KO1AKT8C0F9K	At first I thought that this was a book about a girl's life and her crushes. Other than that it was good.	2
8354	AUMKJWHUCNI69	This is a sample of the book of stories that could be used to count down to Christmas. The tale would be good for a bed time story.	2
8355	A2JHS0EDP3INN7	This book was OK , just OK for me! Unfortunately I lost interest!  The storyline was boring to me :(	2
8356	A2B427WBK10VH9	I liked it ! could this be the future of our planet ,its believable and it moves right along keeping you interested in whats going to happen next.	2
8357	A1V9DJC6GG2802	"A little predictable, especially if you've read the other ""Montana"" sagas. The book is sweet , take it in small bites."	2
8358	A3R0R906UOV5EW	Silly, useless, time-wasting stories... a wonder that such rubbish can be published and actually sold on to the public. Not recommendable.	0
8359	A1RKD07ST2BLOQ	As soon as I started, the language . Was so bas, I quit and returned the set, so I don't know if the actual stories were any good.	0
8360	ABLOQZMM7JIFM	It's okay. Just a short story with a different story line.  Wasn't particularly that sexy or erotic. Nice to have a sexy boss who pays well!	2
8361	A9PU1QS39CL5E	It was ok I do enjoy her books n the characters I just wish the characters are a little swifteev	2
8362	A1IP8K5BLO6VWL	this book did not hold my interest. These are some short stories that could have been better with a little more thought and development.	1
8363	A8SLY9R0QAGPL	didn't even finish the book.  not a story that could hold me and went bad quickly.  don't recommend it to anyone	0
8364	A1XDWTVDF37IT3	I enjoyed this book it flowed and was a very easy book to read. I read it quiet quickly and enjoyed it.	2
8365	A122MJDH0RA2Q3	Too much fluff, but I'm keeping for the 1 or 2 good things he did say.  One thing I remember: Tai Chi may be better for joints than yoga.	2
8366	AQCG4DCFJ8YWH	This was a good book not spectacular.  It was a decent read. Read it for yourself and see what you think	2
8367	A3AQKF73Y2VWTL	All these books were just a story of some one keeping secrets. It was always a silly lie or hidden truth about the pass... pretty boring.	2
8368	A317YD3C1B79LP	I lost interest and my place in the first few pages.  The book is so convoluted that I found it impossible to read.  Don't waste you time.	0
8369	A2EI9JWVQLW6RI	3 starsI thought this book was OK but it had a bunch of typos,the facts were interesting thoughI would recommend it 2 anyone who is bored.	2
8370	A13E9GUF3KHF2F	I enjoyed this book; however, the ending seemed a bit far-fetched to me. I was left wondering, What??? Seemed a bit contrived.	2
8371	A1IJMT5YS1H21C	This book was very entertaining I liked it better than book 1. I am happy things eventually worked out for Tiara	2
8372	A2SU0B8S0VWPH8	Selected memory. Nothing wrong with the events that the memories bring but she could have added some new story to the old one....	2
8373	AZA294V9XKKM2	Not awful but not her best; seems rushed and without a real ending. You'll appreciate if you've read the other books in the series.	1
8374	A21F2KJ1RY7JYJ	Liked series but not as much as others I have read.  Did like characters in all 4books.  Kind of predictable after reading first two.	2
8375	A1WJDQ0YT0T7PL	Im sorry i was not pleased. It was short and to me it was a waste of my time and your time	1
8376	A1NJH26US0VW94	A set of ten novels. Some were excellent others not so much. Great reading  Each approached love differently. A couple just didn't click for me	2
8377	A2BHEPYIDR182L	I love all things cat. I wanted this to be better then it was. It just did not hold my interest. Others may like  it.	1
8378	A12TCY12RMA0YE	I understand there are many volumes but it is simply not long enough for me to want to continue the series	1
8379	A223T998MPEEWS	A very interesting and good reading book it kept  Interest through out the whole thing the more you read it you wanted to find out what happened next	2
8380	A3CL5NE0YZ7CAD	It was just okay. It wasn't the greatest book but not worest book. Just okay. I wish the author would have gone a little deeper.	2
8381	A9U1SUUR15OBC	Bleh...I'm not too impressed. The author tried way too hard... All that fancy make believe stuff isn't necessary to make a good story. A little paranormal goes a long way.	2
8382	ANW0FZACCDDNC	I love Jack Reacher but was somewhat bored by this set of books.  Not bad but can't compare with Lee Child.	2
8383	ALFGUMMTD7M4R	Typical sappy romance, with little story line.  I felt the entire book was just too drawn out with meaningless dribble.  Not impressed.	2
8384	A1F2DEITQNT3YQ	This book was as if I Google &#34; Killer Work from Home Jobs&#34; and everything was listed inside. I could've saved my time reading something else.	1
8385	AM7TAFYY05AAU	I have read thousands of books; and paid for them. This was.a loan and I could not finish three quarters it. NOT GOOD AT ALL.	0
8386	A4SI7Z4XOTI2	No ,,,,,,,,,,,didn't like the story.	0
8387	A16VFBJUU3A23V	I didn't find it to be such a good reading.  Lots of drama & ghetto.  If you want to pass time it's ok reading.	2
8388	A3JWV2T9M1EG3H	Don't know why I downloaded...I got the first couple of chapters read & deleted it.  I'm not in to Psycho stuff.	0
8389	A1BG119FYJEVJ7	I hate when authors end a book in the mist of the story. Love her previous book but because of the poor ending very disappointing.	1
8390	A2GJMFF87NUR3X	Have not completely finished reading the book, missing something but unable to really tell what it is.  Better read the book and make your own judgement.	2
8391	A3CIIU9YNK53VK	This is a very short read. The writing was great. Thrilling storyline. The abrupt ending let me down as it was building up to something.....	2
8392	A22GHKAQRWC1WS	This is a gruesome story, but it is really believable and even brings to remembrance a top news story several years ago.It could use some proof reading.	2
8393	A10M573AXOM1BG	This is a quick ok read... I could have definitely done without the #hashtags throughout the book...I liked the story line.	2
8394	A1X8YI8EKM8YRA	Never no sir. If I had known what this book was about I would not have bought it. B with B never.	0
8395	A3J3XZ9L6EIEEV	This is a very cute, sexy story. Everyone has there own fetish and this is an example of that. Sweet with just enough raunchiness.	2
8396	A34WD107GRX77J	Mediocre at best. Not something that I would recommend, rehashed themes, not very original. Perhaps to a 'newbie' ghost story reader it would suffice for entertainment.	2
8397	AGY7YUR8934HG	The beginning very interesting, but I was not interested in all the exercises.  May be very good for some one who really wants to get into it. Johanna.	1
8398	A35AE4FDOJL2Y8	Didn't like too much. was and okay read but nothing I would read twice just my opinion part two may be better	2
8399	A1ZRNZZNB3W1YL	All i can say is this was it was a free download.  Main character keeps reminding you she is a big girl....we get it, she has low self-esteem.	0
8400	A17UQL76OCVR4F	None of the recipes in this book were very inspiring. Just not things my family would eat. Not recommended. Skip it.	1
8401	A11FF0H63VFFMX	I liked this book.had different angles going on.should have been edited better but other wise this was not bad.i like vampire books so I guess I'm impartial to this one.	2
8402	A26GQLJEYNQI1N	There was not much going on in this book.  I had to get the other book just to get the ending of this one story line which is not fair.	1
8403	A165XMMHVSCWNR	Bad read. Not worth the time. Dont waste your time or money on this one. Not even if you can get it for free.	0
8404	AAZZ885CVOPMG	I stopped reading by the second chapter, this is a no go for me, don't need the story line for entertainment.	0
8405	AMKL57M1WPWOG	The plot was a little mundane. I think the writing could have been a little bit more suspenseful. OK read	2
8406	A28IXGNOGRX2DZ	Nice read but a little juvenile.  Crazy, unpronouncable names.  The story line is good but it is a little too out there.	2
8407	AY5WJIS7Y6SJO	It was well written but, too short. This book needs more of a back story for both characters. Requires more detail in general	2
8408	A34YHOJRRN6IEK	Story was good, but some parts were just a little to lite for my taste.  It could have been a stronger storyline.	2
8409	A29SDLXUO3DUU4	From what I have read so far I am very pleased with the book.  Will tell better as I get into it more.	2
8410	A1B5ICLGJWF9T3	It was okay don't know if I would buy book 2 hope it's much better than this one but good luck	1
8411	A1X87IHRK15RBU	This book is a very quick read but it's a very nice little story, I've given two stars not as a negative but simply because there's not much of it.	1
8412	A3QSC9SRBLJUBV	Nice easy going mystery. Light but hard to figure out. Good  in between story when others are so heavy. Enjoyed it	2
8413	A5V9K2ZQNRME2	I was able to glean some delicious sounding recipes from this book. I liked that it had dishes from 4 different authors with very different styles.	2
8414	A94BFH8ULHCK5	"I Don""t have to much to say about this short book the author is just trying to sell more books and didn't focus on his own book"	1
8415	AUNDFBRCE0WES	It was too hard to get into.  Where I am at right now, I need something light and fast paced.  Not real violent.	1
8416	A1GKI2R8TP2H4C	story goes no where, tells you nothing. kept reading just to see if some excitement might occur-- didn't happen. have regrets about the time wasted on this book	0
8417	A30409POT5S6K9	"A pretty good alternative ""how they met"" tale told (as usual) from Watson's perspective. You can read better Holmes fiction, but you can also read a lot worse."	2
8418	A124LGB9NCLVUQ	And fun.  A good read.  Looking forward to the remaining books.  This book was well written and not easy to put down.	2
8419	A1VJELPXZ33KIP	The stories are pretty good - not super scary, but not too simplistic, either.  My 8 year-old & I really enjoyed reading them together.	2
8420	APHRI6QXZ9Y0P	A little too sappy for me. BUt you might like it. I did finish it though so it was not THAT bad,.	1
8421	A1PCJJ6GAW524Z	I did not like this book it was a stupid story all about boxing, did not interest me at all	0
8422	A157FDWZGYPSW6	Was a good quick easy to read book but did not hold me attention.Eden was a great character but only needed Billy in this story.	2
8423	A279AT4OT92T2E	This one I'll reLoad when I have more storage space, who goes not have some Secrets and Lies, yes they get us in some big trouble sometimes???	2
8424	A3UCUIPB87ZFOH	I started to read it, and it is not my style. I do not like style, characters, descriptions... Not worth my time	0
8425	A2KM1W4B5T3K3O	It was a good read. Loved the exchanged of previous characters follow up in this story as well since they are all family. But it let me wanting more.	1
8426	A2XPHUKLUWEYOV	I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK AT ALL I JUST COULD NOT GET IN TO IT IT JUST WAS NOT FOR ME	0
8427	A3LFN7TE5X5Q00	It was a readable book but parts of the story were not so plausible. I didn't like the solution to get her out of the control of the bad guy.	2
8428	AA0WDL8TB0LS	Will try a few recipes. These folks really like bacon. Would have liked pictures for the yummy effect. Just ok.	1
8429	A1W4ZRZL9VTEZ0	Not a very good translation. I was looking forward to this book, but I went back to wishing they'd re-issue &#34;Treasury of Jewish Folklore&#34; instead.	0
8430	A2ZKQ6PER3IJB7	I was very bored waiting at the airport so downloaded this book out of curiosity.  I've made better ones than this but reading the book passed the time.	2
8431	A10K4CN7CEA3K0	This is a quick short story, or it seemed.  Things happen so fast that you dont feel or see the connection between them.	2
8432	AR4MM68FE251H	This book was ok......it had its moments and then at times it kind of trailed off a bit so just ok for me	2
8433	A1LYFI8TUCB1QX	Not bad - the story was OK, the characters may not be great but it's a quick and nice read.	2
8434	A21GB1IOLZ4EG0	Good, hot, steamy books for the most part but the editing is awful. However it was definitely worth .99 cents.	2
8435	A2GHGCZUQWU9DY	This was a fun read with many plot twists & turns. I look forward to reading more by this author:).Huggz,Betty	2
8436	A36CMKGJ1YVKIT	I really don't remember this book. I can't find it on my kindle.	2
8437	A3V3OE9BRKSE35	she has written better with a more involved story line  this one was really easy to figure outmore like Cademon, please!	2
8438	A2FY6K9VOWEKN0	a fun read, it could have been longer(took about 30 mins to read) but it was devoleped something of a good story	2
8439	A294TCLORRO9M0	I really enjoyed this book. It was not my normal type book I read. More of a thriller.  I would consider reading another book by the author.	2
8440	A1DUQSP79CW0A2	Its not what I thought it would be but full of information to help get yourself a job that you can work at home.	2
8441	A2H19TYZFH5RGY	Too short to give a honest review really. Would have liked to read more. Think I will pass on buying these series. They're too short usually and overpriced.	0
8442	A1CN6V9J4OWJR1	A very slow pace novel, the hope that there was a history behind the swords never showed up, don't waste your time!	0
8443	AZMMFZKJB8PV6	I love short stories but this one did not do anything for me, the plot was decent, but the characters were forgettable .	2
8444	A3E8YLPYJZ4BIH	I probably would have liked this story when I was a lot younger, probably 11 or 12.  Not scary at all.	1
8445	AX3W2FJYMPWZQ	I never gave some of the subjects much thought, but the points she brings out are definitely true for me.	2
8446	A2PHWQXM6OQPUX	Enjoyable little story...too little. I'd have liked this to be drawn out more, seems like the characters moved all too quickly to the end.	2
8447	A1OJMU7IPXT9KU	I realize this was a short story....but that short?! Surely there is more to this story than this! Not good at all.	0
8448	A11SS5439VMJLA	It was a quick steamy read, we will see how the other 2 are, I'm hoping to get a little more character development throughout the series.	2
8449	A3FWCXZ2XH6VRA	I thought it was a good book and gave me some good info about  sheltering at home and some supplies that are needed	2
8450	AZAL6EE3NXF7Q	This not an award winning book by any means, I would rate this book as just an average grade book.	2
8451	A1HA3JP02YTV1N	So glad this was free.  So glad this was free. Nothing more to say. Nothing more.  Nothing.  Not a thing. End.	0
8452	A23FKXZ5VNQUN7	I liked the Old Soul book by Joseph and would love to read this one also of Warm Moonlight okay?	0
8453	AK6Z4WDTZBDXY	It felt rushed as if there was no time for them to actually get to know each other. Plus, only a few sex scenes which failed to impress. A bore.	1
8454	A3FL50R3I0I0T1	This is a very simple story, short but we can read it quickly and smile. If you like love stories, read it.	2
8455	A1G9QDNPZ0TV5M	I found it to be ok for a highland novel. Not to good for a part 1 of a 4 part series.	1
8456	A30J0XSBCCJAIV	The handsome hairdresser that the women loved, the men disliked is murdered.It's up to Susan Finkelstein  to delve into the mystery.Cute turn of eventsShirley Ann	2
8457	A1I7VZM3LCG33M	Unbelievable plot and characters with a plethora of bodies, spiders, snakes, hidden treasure, and an underground sewer tunnel, not to mention witches and one greedy ex-husband.Silly, but fun.	2
8458	AY656MPPUK0B9	I was expecting a full length book.  It was barely a taste.  If it had indicated it was a short story, I probably would have passed.	0
8459	A12M4OTJ8VOGO6	Not so believable story of young girl and older man thinly written as a coming of age setting.  It's okay for a trashy read.	2
8460	A2NS6PKNVMZ5C0	am sorry ---- i accidentally deleted it from the kindle before i had time to check it out.  i apologize.	2
8461	AOM88W4SL9ZGX	I love dogs and this book is funny but it's not a page tuner due to the unrealistic plot. Read it if you really have nothing to.	1
8462	A1PCX79L6QP8SF	Way to childishly written.  I though it would be a bit more for an adult to read.  Story line is ok but better suited to a teen.	2
8463	A18MG1GPSEAPE9	i hate having to write long reviews.  this is cute.. i love digital i love saving the trees but definitly not long reviews	2
8464	AJD6VZQRZBODH	I read parts 1 and 2 and was invested so read part 3 - - was ok, quick read but just ok for me.	2
8465	A2NHFTXXPAS3N6	This book did not offer anything new.  If you are new to organizing this book may offer you some ideas.	0
8466	A2E9BQ09JHXTVW	I bought this one for my nine year old grandson and he really enjoyed it.  He's read it at least 4 times.  It is for younger children.	2
8467	A19B0UB53D820Y	You can tell the author is really enthusiastic about the subject and wants to help you start the day off right!	2
8468	A2KHEWJ5INQEL1	This was on my kindle. It was a 20 minute read. I personally felt it had no substance. Will not purchase anymore titles.	1
8469	A2BFSG6IS72R2N	The story is different from the movie by Disney. Much better than the movie. The characters in the first story I'm more familiar with.	2
8470	A3R25LAPU1WXIQ	NO. Too teeny boperish. Too trite. God is NOT trite and Pentecostals ain't all that. (Use to be one so I know!)Save your dollar and your time.	0
8471	A3PU2P9LL35BIP	As I have only just started to read this book, I need to get more into it to give my thoughts	2
8472	A3VUS2CR3XTEZ0	I can't feel really passionate about reading any more of this series.  It's okay for a lazy time but nothing to stay up to finish.	2
8473	A143IV9N6HPKKB	Funny and witty romance.  Well written.  Entertaining.  Loved the beginning of the story.  Kept my interest.  Well written.  would recommend.	2
8474	A38OZ0XEGRW7G5	Usually I can go through a book in no time. This one drug on and on. Paid 2.99 for it. would recommend it for free or .99 .	2
8475	A3CRU4A7R48QZK	This was the first cook book that I got some good stuff in here something for everyone glad to have given it a chance	2
8476	A2WDNRHWHEY8IH	Just an OK book for me, didn't like the way one topic ran into another.  A little confusing at times.  Needed some editing.  Basically a good story, predictable, but OK.	2
8477	A1J1K8QRC5YPYU	It was a waste of an hour, take a pass on it.  The title is misleading and the premise was boring.	0
8478	A22XZQ37UMYQLL	Nice and quick short story. Slow beginning and the ending wasn't what I expected at all. Is there a Part Two?	2
8479	AVH4GY1FITZ0P	This is my least favorite book by this writer.  I found the story unbelievable and the ending was a disaster.  He has written many books better than this one.	1
8480	A29OBTJRFR6FVD	Um Ya this books was all over the place I mean it was good but I was lost a few times. Yeah just yeah.	2
8481	A1T81IM4UMV468	A quick Halloween read to get you into the mood. Two main college age characters along with cat in haunted apartment. Will sparks fly again. A fast paced story.	2
8482	AUK9DWLDGXBNZ	Interesting enjoyed the read enjoyed the story but the story I. Was not as good as other of her books thanks	2
8483	AAGZDHAMS9TFT	Just as expected. Nothing surprising in the story.  Not likely that I will read any of the other books in the series.	2
8484	AQPGZAEKIGOHA	It weird that I would be ask to give a review on a book that I have never heard of much less read.	0
8485	A1GP7RVHHI5GOP	This book was Entertaining. I enjoyed it. The story had a few twists and turns. I enjoyed the ending, it made me smile.	2
8486	AXL0WPTYGXJD4	It was good reading for those who enjoy a good mystery.  Detective Salvatori is a great puzzle solver.  It was fun to solve the clues along with Salvatori	2
8487	A3ADTI3M4NSN1F	It was written in Evanovich's style but the people could not be completely characterized in such a short story. Would have liked it to be longer and more detailed.	2
8488	A3L576T8NMSD9H	it was okay.  the story needed more of something.  not sure what is between the witch and the elf, too many in answer questions.	2
8489	A2QTOTWE5ZRCZK	This is stupid! Eat the fruits/veges and stop trying to make it new and different. You are not going to help your health with this ridiculous fad.	0
8490	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	Um, o.k. Good short. I actually don't have twenty words for this review. Like I said before, it wasn't bad.	2
8491	ATN99Q9ULXNKJ	Not at all what I expected, an ok read but a lot of high school like drama that seemed a bit unnecessary.	2
8492	ANUDWVSEGVBK8	Parts of the book was a bit boring but still over all good.	2
8493	AO0RTNT8HO866	There were three stories.  The first two were ok.  I absolutely loved the last story about Tom, the boy with the terrible secret.	2
8494	AF8K7HXE8Y1TO	this book was good but not enough romance. it goes into details about surrounding and changing clothes that has nothing to do with the story.	2
8495	A9SE0K18Z19O1	I can't get into this book. I have tried. I am only 20% in to the book and have read several other in this time. Sorry.	1
8496	A3TD1MKR4MJ260	I guess humiliation is not a turn on for me. I just felt bad for the main character. The sex seens were raunchy and hot I suppose.	1
8497	A3UAZ68D97TCED	This was a ok free read, I wish it would of went into more detail. Free read do didn't lose anything	2
8498	A2B5TQ2Z4ZRFQZ	I found this book to be disappointing and very poorly written. The characters lacked grit and testosterone. Story's lacked depth.	1
8499	AAR3Z34IPZL1Z	Stupid. This  has to be one of the dumbest short that I have ever read.glad I didn't pay for this.	0
8500	A8AVATIEBTIOZ	This publication had some interesting articles and tips, but I found the tone and tendency of the political commentary disturbing, shallow and self-righteous.  I would personally avoid any further volumes.	1
8501	ANTGDHYSDAKG2	For someone who enjoys erotica this is not for you, for someone who enjoys romance this is not for you either. There really wasnt a point at all	1
8502	A3MO6BG8KF73GK	This was another short story. It was entertaining, just not what I was looking for. Not a bad book though.	1
8503	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This story was not my cup of tea. It was not what I was expecting. I did not finish the ebook.	1
8504	A2DVKRPGU2RO1S	This book could have easily been combined with the second of the series, but instead we have to pay for a few chapters.  Not good for customer satisfaction!	2
8505	A1IV34PJYMU7X2	This book was.different.and is for someonne whose tastes are more liberal then mine.  Believe it could happy, yet I question the outcome.	2
8506	A2OTF5FOCCYWGE	just couldnt get pass the 2nd chapter... this is probably the first urban lit i have ever bought and didnt read all the way thru just couldnt get into it	0
8507	A3VVUPPH3PIK7R	I had a hard time getting into it.....The reviews were good but I couldn't get through it  It may be a good book didn't do it for me	1
8508	A3EMFUQ768HFEE	Good read but very short.  I felt the book could have had more to it and be a much better book.	2
8509	A2EMSMOP8Z4WCS	The writing was too choppy for me.  Characters narrative was all short sentences.  The storyline sounded good but that was all for me.	1
8510	A1DCEAO6ZJFNZ3	This was a sad and heartbreaking book but it shows you what true love is all about. Tyler is a wonderful man and a perfect book boyfriend.	2
8511	A1SZM7QPOH29Y3	This was a good book I only wish it was a little longer than it was a true page turner	2
8512	A9GPEIJ6JS3UE	Cute, very quick, lots of holiday spirit and terribly predictable. While it would have been better if it were less predictable, it was still nice and seasonal.	2
8513	A19TJVBZMM5PZ2	Cute novella. Love the heroine -- took me a bit to warm up to the hero. A few typos which switched the names of two of the characters.	2
8514	A8H3WVK9NWWZP	Was a little let down with this book. Nowhere near as good as the first book. :-( Not sure if I will read the others in this series????	2
8515	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	there is something for everybody in this short story collection. each author has something to say in a unique way.it was a kindle freebie.	2
8516	A2K5EDV5JJLJG1	Tried to read this, but the incredibly badly written style made it impossible.  Don't try this at home, it isn't worth the effort.	0
8517	A29WDFCORHXCXN	This book was fine at the beginning but kept repeating key points of the the authors opinion. This is an interesting subject and I hoped for more.	2
8518	A1T72Z52TO7SLR	Not interested in m/m in any way, I'm sure in not the only one . So maybe a label or warning next time, thank you.	0
8519	A2YD0X1J8DECW9	While the plot was good. I would have liked to have had more suspense. The romance happened to quick for me	2
8520	A24PLG7MEH8WDB	It is just smut with a weak story line	0
8521	A2Q95CRI8CONPE	Not too bad for a quickie. Free is always good. Probably wouldn't have paid for this but since it was free....	2
8522	A2MGI8S6N8ECB5	I liked the stories but they all seemed a little bland, they could've been a lot more colorful and longer stories.	2
8523	A2CBBDDM7VQOIH	I could not even stay focus on this book in reality I feel I could give more tips that. Are effective than the guidelines of book	1
8524	A3E235XTVR4RSU	Just ok.  nothing exceptional, too quick a read.  ok if you like short rather routine type book.  Nothing to get excited agouts.	2
8525	A1QRQOG50DU53M	It has a good storyline ,nothing to over the top. Great byplay between the main characters. Really hot sex scenes.	2
8526	A23BS90GTA9DX9	not really impressed with this story . Did not get much out of this and did not want another story.	1
8527	A1HHNYWGE8IH44	not captivating like the other books but I still recommend it if you are a fan of this author.her other books are much more of a legal thriller.	2
8528	A3V3OE9BRKSE35	some of this is a little far fetched, but romance usually isI hope the next installment will bring more closure; I do also hope there is another after that	2
8529	A5EWSSNKCCQBD	i like to read a whole story not just a part- this is part 1 of 6 and the rest are not free	2
8530	AGTV1DMRMBRSQ	This one turned out to be a bondage novel.  A little too rough for my tastes, so I put it down. mb	0
8531	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This story is not my cup of tea. I did not get very far in the story. I did not finish the story.	1
8532	AK2Q56V1PR5QG	It was a pretty good read and had some good advice.  However, some of the things were &#34;too&#34; minimum...(smile).  I would recommend it, however.	2
8533	A2THBF9N7EG4DN	Not a real book. Just a tease to make you buy more. Do not like the premise for this series, so definitely won't waste my money on the rest.	0
8534	A2IOCRL0ZW12L3	I was expecting so much but fell short. The cover is misleading, thinking the it was going to be great read but got bored.	1
8535	A1TGSSYT00RWS6	I did not like the book, didn't finish reading it.  I deleted it from my Kindle.  I would not recommend it.	1
8536	A3JY8R1BQJIDEG	Of all her BBW books. This is now my favorite.Sexy bear, luscious wolf , and a comet.Check it out!!!!	2
8537	ADTBCTN0DNAIQ	I like travel memoirs and this book didn't do it for me.  I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends.  I just skipped through it.	2
8538	A3OO6N9LBUL5QC	A dishonest &#34;expose&#34; of the LDS Church. The author is obviously anti Mormon and we are supposed to be a tolerant society. This book is crap.	0
8539	A3E8H1MVXYLJ09	This was good quick read!!I would recommend this book if you want to get your feet wet in urban fiction!!!!	2
8540	A1BKERTS8SPHER	I THINK IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ABOUT SPIRITS & FRIGHTENING, BUT LOST ME SOME WHERE.  THIS OLD ENGLISH TYPE WRITING IS DEEP FOR SOME PEOPLE.	0
8541	A1DC00T32U26HC	Lots of action. Good characters and story line. Interesting concept about the world of sexual orientation and games. Not a bad read. No constant editing messes.	2
8542	A3GQY7UCN7FAWJ	The way the book started off so sad, I couldn't really enjoy their love story.  Just so much pain, but I glad she found her voice in the end.	2
8543	AKOLD2E17G0G0	This story may have been better for me if I had read the first book.  However, it was well written, just a little too short.  Romance happened really quick.	2
8544	A20NUAFQ658EGG	The first of three was very good.  The last 2 were OK.  Stil worth the time even if yu don't read but one.	2
8545	A305IQ7UEK2YDG	I didn't care about the book and read about couple of chapters just was not interesting to me. not interested	1
8546	A2QIV8TIWHW65Y	Reading this book was a drudgery.  I found the story juvenile, disjointed and simply dull. Save yourself some money and pass up purchase of this book!	0
8547	A1V142M3X0KEQU	I please I haven't read the book and I probably won't read the book it doesn't interest meI have no review to do.	1
8548	A2WB5LJ9IZSPD	Right after I read this book I immediatly deleted it from the my Kindle.  Not a hole lot of content.	2
8549	A2N3X7514J2COM	Motive for murder isn't really there and characters could be developed a little more fully.  Quick read but unnecessary.  You can skip this one.	2
8550	A14DUDH4XI44SE	I liked the style of this writer, but it wasn't that spicy of a short story compared to some others I have read. Still, I enjoyed it.	2
8551	A2KMIMO72BUQEY	JUST A FLUFF PIECE. Reads like a story written after reading story writing for dummy's.Not that interesting save your money!!!!!	1
8552	A1NDMPC1Y56X53	This is the first Amish book I've read. Kind of predictable but none the less a good read.  I will look for more from this author.	2
8553	A239V2RANQO4LZ	Found it rather boring in parts with so much tech, but easy reading tho did skip parts of it, not on my re-read list!	2
8554	ADBBIDFE7ZZWK	Nash and Sophie. it took Nash a long time to get to the one he loves. I enjoyed reading this book. just like the others.	2
8555	A3BYGBLXCOMR8E	Hated this. One of the rare times I couldn't even finish a book completely pointless thank goodness it was free	0
8556	A64PXNB1G6EWF	Many cute ideas for your cuttlebug, but not for everyone.  Not very compelling to the experienced crafter.  Very basic designs, excellent resource for the beginner.	2
8557	AJGPML53ZL1U3	I enjoyed the book.  It was written very well couldn't put it down, highly recommend it to anyone who likes romance novels.	2
8558	A86ZZ9LEX94BG	What a great writer, he is one of my favorite authors.  This short story is in my opinion one of his best. I can't wait for the next book.	2
8559	A1CYCHQ9DA7KC8	Not my thing sexually at all, didn't realize it when I bought it. My fault for not reviewing it better...	0
8560	A2W1YXC6QT3KGZ	This story was cute. My children enjoyed the fun rhyming and silliness of a camel with no hump! I'm sure we'll enjoy this again!	2
8561	A3G6Z28R3RIMUT	I got through it. There were some poignant moments. Very cut and dried. It was a journey of self-discovery and healing.	2
8562	A3SQHJP1ODGLS0	The story could have been better if not for h annoying friends.  I would love to see the h could realize her own feeling. The story is interesting.	0
8563	A3C03V1B9OQPOH	Didn't learn much from this app.  Maybe it is because I am &#34;too knowledgeable&#34; and not really a 'beginner' with apps, just a new kindle fire owner.	2
8564	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	this story began like a twilight zone episode.as it progressed,it seemed more and more unbelievable.i read through quickly and found the ending unsatisfying.	1
8565	A3SQD3Y7EPYEUQ	it was a pretty good story I just wasn't to crazy about the ending it just stopped I wanted more	2
8566	A1GU0H1M466934	Out of all the story's in this collection. I only liked 3 of the story's. Was very disappointed. Bad story lines	0
8567	A31MLLDYP9VQ7D	Great story with big spanner in the works at the end. Louise and Richard are hot. Look forward to finishing the series.	2
8568	A3ES0XIED7769J	A fast pasted get to know someone. A naughty way to eat chocolate. A different way to get to know someone.	2
8569	ATUY2V0LUDES7	I thought it would be filled with interesting myths and customs of the Middle Ages but really the title is misleading.	1
8570	AF8R0V93DLSAU	This was not my type of book.  The content was not to my liking, but others mite like it.  I would not read the sequel to Colters' Woman.	1
8571	A34XFAQU5PBHF2	I found the prior books to be more interesting. This actually got annoying in places with the back and forth.	2
8572	A36GOVBMVY13GK	This is not what I would consider a book it is more like a excerpt than a book, would like it to be just more.	1
8573	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	These recipes contain too many canned ingredients. I shudder to think of their sodium content.Also,I would not need to cook for 10 people.	2
8574	A2F0TZS091UW0O	Once again we get half a book  but to keep up that is the way it is good thing there not costly	0
8575	A1HLVMOPUAL5O4	I was a little disappointed in the stories. One of the reasons I chose this was because of the Arthur's I just didn't think it was up to their usual	2
8576	A2YI1HCMXAH9LB	I wasn't impressed, it was seriously lacking in the sexy, drama, hotness department for me.  I wouldn't recommend this book if that is what your looking to read.	1
8577	A1KJFEW8U5Y926	The writing is good but the plots are a gruesome.  I started this trilogy but have put it aside.  I don't know if I'll come back to it.	1
8578	ARE2L71C2ECGP	Too short, too fast. The story was kinda sweet, but too short for me. But that does not means other readers won't enjoy this short story.	2
8579	A295JZUV1IAHHU	I liked this book but I knew the person responsible before the author gave any clues, then I felt like I was reading a Nancy Drew novel...............	2
8580	A2MHCZISNWHQFR	Decent story, goes better with &#34;Orbs.&#34; As a standalone, it's a little lacking. It's good for a quick read, though.	2
8581	A19T1A4TS1WHOZ	until it hit a huge vampire-as-medium pothole. Lost the suspension and never got it back.  I was disappointed in the end.	1
8582	ANNJ8FZ6KRUTO	It was okay, I found it more of a love story than a scifi story. It was just interesting enough to keep me reading.	2
8583	AA2CQ7CSDX50S	It was just okay. I did like the premise, and thought the writing was good if not great. While entertaining, I didn't find the story riveting.	2
8584	A3SI95QR7LKIJ0	Not my style at all. Was disappointed. Jumped around to much. Didn't know it was short stories under the guise of chapters.	0
8585	A22BZ8XZQKVHOI	I wish writers could simply just write a nice book and eliminate the vulgar language. I didn't complete this book due to the unholy language.	2
8586	A2T1BM3RJ6ZSF7	I hope this becomes a new series. It seems like it was over before it started. I will just worry about the safety of the pets.	2
8587	A3CKP9IEAJEN8Q	Good story. Not the best I have read but still interesting, kept the storyline going. Not one I would like to keep, enjoyed it all the same.	2
8588	A3RSD84BSE5RIQ	Dated story; was not expected the narrative to be written as current time frame. Somehow it just didn't resonate for me.	2
8589	A17FDFSQ1OLOUN	this was just okay for me  , i stopped reading it,so it might have got better as it went along	2
8590	A2KS7XM8Z13Y78	For a short story it was ok...The characters were interesting and seemed like they were going to make a good story. Just not enough substance for me.	1
8591	AWZ60T8B0ITAP	A beauty is being stalked by a serial murderer. With the help of a premonition and a former FBI agent, a plan is formed.	2
8592	AHRYGZ88RPTI6	Keely and Jack are newly married.  This short story is continuously passionate but very repetative.  No more than a 3 star.	2
8593	A2A8DFY2Y6T1PA	I didn't find this in any way scandalous, nor the hero a scoundrel unless we are suddenly taking that to mean half-American.  It was however a bit corny.	1
8594	A3CZG353T65MX7	this book was not very good at all.  the story didn't make sense. don't know if i will read anymore from this author.	1
8595	A1O4UJJRVKRNM9	Lots of the usual DASH Diet recipes but I would have like to see an index and better formatting for Kindle.	2
8596	A1F401NVFK11SW	It was ok. I hope the next book is better. I don't agree with Lustray keeping his child away from him bcuz they didn't work.	2
8597	A388XBO57T6COX	This was just to simple too much information about nothing. The heroine was shallow and Colt was a good guy who did not deserve her.	0
8598	A1W14PR7J7GH96	Ok, finished reading the book, but skimmed a lot of it.Silly story, thought they were never going to get around t arresting anyone!	1
8599	A31OQIF4LEMG4	This was a good read but had a lot of editing errors. Looking forward to part two and to see what else this author has to offer	2
8600	A3DRXQ7CATEB1S	Spicy, well-written. And it's a good idea to pick up another character from the series: I didn't expect the heroine to be Leo's unfortunate fianc&eacute;e.	2
8601	A1CANESXXA8M1J	It was an okay book. I like longer books but the story was good and I could picture everything happening in my head as I was reading it.	2
8602	A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2	I downloaded based on suggestions on my kindle and did not finish the novel so can't write a worthy review	0
8603	A1LLD6284W6XEV	I have already read the next one in the series, so I know how this goes but I think there could of been more.	2
8604	A3UG72I11Z1HGC	Not particularly good.  Her characterizations were shallow and the storyline was predictable, but above all, it didn't hold my interest and I found my mind wandering.	1
8605	A1VZMEU0F0OXHL	I love dystopian and apocalyptic novels. I just could not get into these. They are far fetched and almost ridiculous.	0
8606	A15P0BAFV2LDVQ	Disappoint with the flow of the story. Too many main character don't even knw who to focus on. However the entire book was choppy. Hope the sequel is improved	2
8607	AOA6CM7VV8QRZ	It was very interesting to read and learn about what it's like to wait on true love. An happy endings	2
8608	A3GESTN87BZJDI	Did not enjoy this book as much as the previous ones. This one really had no conclusion which I find annoying.	2
8609	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	that's all I can really say....it was okay. It was very short and NO sex. Lucky for me it was free.	1
8610	A2PZBM8B7MJ750	This book is lighthearted, the characters are unique and the protagonist is easy to like.  Like a &#34;beach read&#34; but without the beach.	2
8611	A1533T1FCFFVF0	This book was just not my kind of book.  Sex is good but this was over the top for me.	2
8612	A39GEZZYHWYTVU	It works well, though some parts feel a bit stretched.If anything, it reminds me of a Scifi channel demo.	2
8613	A28REJAM6899K8	Mr. March must have lost his mind. His lust just took over but it turned out okay in the end.	2
8614	ATLEU1BWH8K6C	No Way Out - And Other Scary Short Stories - Great for HaloweenPretty good stories to read for Halloween. Short succinct and scary. I enjoyed them. I reccommend this book.	2
8615	A3V4AFZL85TS8	Barely literate, hardly erotic, poorly conceived, utterly unbelievable. I had no connection to any of the characters in this tale.	0
8616	A3QNUFAJ4VTDIM	The story was too short for my liking. However for the content it was an ok read and geared for teens. Not a bad book.	2
8617	ALTZKO00IA4EB	I don't answer this book who do Charlotte want this book is not bad but it is confusing well if any one want to read it they can	2
8618	AIO7MG1IR0UR8	when it was getting good it ended to many sex and little complicated to understand but can't wait for the second part.	2
8619	A21BZ2JA2BHR1	This is a very good series moves fast don't drag on and on it is well worth the read check it out	2
8620	A39V90SZTMWF7C	I had to buy this to replace the stock cord for my kindleso far I have not had any issues with it charging my kindle fire	2
8621	ALFGUMMTD7M4R	Typical romance.  Short story that seemed to still have some fill that wasn't necessary to the storyline.  Okay as a Christmas story.	2
8622	A1XVTDXU7HC3KN	Very short sexy fast paced submission. It was good and well written. Romance in the middle of a storm of nature. Give it a try.	2
8623	AIA2FLO81A32B	This book has a good story line, but instead od writing this chapter by chapter just write the whole book and then publish it.	2
8624	A37CSQ2V9A79LB	While I was hesitant to continue reading from the first page, I'm glad I did since the story just got better. Give it a try for a quick read.	2
8625	A1GOAEIAC9NBOG	Not a big fan when I read only male POV...it was an OK read didn't really feel the connection between the main characters and the epilogue?? WTF?!	2
8626	A1BVC7ADOK5PD9	Very disjointed. The storyline leaves a lot of the details out. Example: the h wrecks her car, we never hear anything about the wreck again. It is a bit highschoolish.	0
8627	A34GZ0IEBM5BHK	I cant wait for book 2 this is a great book lovin itI love,loveSo muchGabrielle spires luv ya	2
8628	A23Q7SCNEANQO0	It was a pretty good short story. It had love,suspense and a happy ending. I try and read everything by Heather Graham.	2
8629	A2KEX55F9H5K8R	ending unclear left you hanging did not indicate a sequel needed to either end or continue is there another book	2
8630	A4CLDG2CSIQG9	A clever little short story but I frankly thought I was getting a whole novel for the price.  I felt a bit cheated for that reason.	2
8631	A1H8HZIRD62WFH	I have read and enjoyed the whole series even though $3 is high for short stories. Each of her books in this series gets shorter.	2
8632	A3B1I3EC3O6MXO	This had the works for a great book, but something was off.  Both of the main characters whine throughout the book.  I was not impressed.	1
8633	A34FGMJ3K5O6GT	An OK story, it was almost immature. At least it was for me. I think it was because how the story was put together	2
8634	AGAEUZKE4SKT2	it helped clear up some things fromOutlander. It wasn't very specific about what happened to the hero but I liked it.	2
8635	A1SDJWU28LDH13	Predictable but enjoyable.  I like her series and enjoy the bantering between the Gage, Archer and Matt.  Can't wait for Matt's story	2
8636	A3ALRW2T7S2UGZ	This held my attention enough to complete the book, barely. Far fetched would best describe this novel. If you are into fantasy, it should satisfy your needs.	2
8637	A3AHWZMMMD3DV1	i mature and not worth writing about. i hated it this book is for under 18 years old or 21 yrs old. not for mature audiences.	0
8638	A11TMWVEG9R9OF	The story is good and well written but too many pieces instead of one book.  I wouldn't start reading another series presented like this.	2
8639	A1IAOK84VZ42J0	Somebody please get this author a decent editor! Good story was ruined by bad editing. Taz/Tarr/Tar, who was it? Confusing and distracting.	1
8640	A1Q5NGUHNJBVC0	I give it three stars it was a bit disjointed in places and slow in others but over all a good light read	2
8641	A1GU9FWEL83A69	I did not like  the way the author shows how church men betray women for for their sexual needs. I was turn off within the first five chapters.	0
8642	A1M06ZXC0PM602	Plot-- awful.  Characters--cardboard.  Dialogue--the worst!  I stopped reading it because I believed the book was sucking IQ points right out of my head.	0
8643	A2NWX3V72SC7F3	Not a lot of great ideas if you been in the game. I guess this could help somebody that was completely retarded.	1
8644	A1SMFSKUDOMV1Q	good western style of not so much gentleman that truman quality hiros	2
8645	A3FWCXZ2XH6VRA	I did not really like this book but that is just me, others may find it more useful than I did	1
8646	A3EL7CP7NVGDIN	This book kept me on the edge of my seat. The ending was disappointing but overall still a good read.	2
8647	A3RJ4TAYH5IMBN	I like Michael Connelly as a writer but I like to see the characters being more thoroughly developed.  These were very short stories and left me wanting more info.	2
8648	A27WS5Y213T44I	.took me longer to download it than it did to read it. Plot was boring and pretty much the story itself was non existant. I was disappointed	1
8649	A1E2MU38I9I0B3	Cute but very short story, that needed so much more to the story. It could have been so much better.	2
8650	A2MQULLDLSF6UT	The book is a quick read, a  simple story line, and fairly light. An easy Saturday afternoon read	2
8651	A2F30LRVIUA3SO	Entertaining but completely unrealistic.  After reading the first story I could not force myself to continue on to the second.	1
8652	A565E2Z4QHS40	Extraction was so familiar to a chapter in another Preston and Child novel. I really didn't need to take the time to read it again.	2
8653	A1G9QDNPZ0TV5M	Not what I was expecting in a quick vampire short novel. It was ok. I don't have much to say about it.	2
8654	A2TKC3LSDM104Q	No no no. Do not buy this book. All it is drama, no real plot, poor characterization, and no direction. Do not waste your money!	0
8655	A1G6J2T87JFO6S	The book left a lot of unfinished business (e.g. with the heroine's family, etc.) unlike other historical romances; in this, I was a bit disappointed. Otherwise a pretty good book	2
8656	A2VN1ZJY12PKDN	Very hot very fast. Pure fantasy, pure lusty dreams. Too  bad dreams like this can't come true.definitely raises your temp to read!	2
8657	A3SXG6TX7RF3ZL	Was a short cute romance ending left you hanging.the other sound more interesting but sound more about Elizabeth than Dylan who I liked most.	2
8658	A1QZ31W7X47X8	This was my first book by this author. It was enjoyable although somewhat farfetched. I really hated the incorrect verb tense and misspelled words. Did not like the ending either.	2
8659	A4OJWUX1MKR3B	It was ok	2
8660	A3KF9GEKN2DXTU	A very dark book. Has me a bit confused about some things but I was a hard read at some points.	1
8661	AU320XTSA034T	I'm not a huge fan of Piers Morgan and perhaps that influenced my opinion.  If felt the book to be a reflection of his flippant personality.	1
8662	A1NLQ24MRMZ9N5	The constant dithering of the heroine between her two men got on my nerves, as did the contrived&#34;crisis&#34; moment. Oh please, does anyone talk like these people anymore	1
8663	A10EDPEXKY6ICB	Didn't really cover what I needed but did give me some basic information and tips. I will still need to get another guide.	2
8664	A1PVJDRJPOMSDT	This book is probably one of the worst I have ever read.  Even if it was self published, it should have been deleted from Kizer's hard drive!	0
8665	A12MY8GWE93REP	Wasn't my book. Couldn't get through it.	2
8666	A2MHTO6K2VBQH5	This was an ok read.  There doesn't need to be a  sequel.  There was nothing excitable about either the H/H. Mrs. Fabriccio was the more exciting character.	1
8667	A1H53EF3RUPGFN	I loved the concept of the story but it could have been longer. I can see someone approaching someone in a mask because they are afraid of rejection. Sweet story.	2
8668	A14VIIXAXEM7K2	I think this ebook is a great beginning for someone who is interesed in the stock market. I read it fast and i think is essential for students and profesionals	2
8669	A1X29PLYC168T	I felt this was not fully developed.  Perhaps it is difficult to get much storytelling &#34;traction&#34; in so few pages? I did finish it which meant two stars.	1
8670	A3SB1V0ZNXXWDJ	Sweet read. A nice feel good read that makes it hard to put down.  Enjoyed it very much.  Good read.	2
8671	A2KTNKLHGEHSX2	Okay read. The plot was good.  I knew characters from prior books. Seemed a bit busy with other problems while solving j	2
8672	AZD74VERJY2LP	This was nice and light book to read. A girl who has to face doing what's best for her and a guy who is struggling to forgive himself	2
8673	A7889XULZ1U6Q	Too many recipes call for tubs of Cool Whip or Boxed Cake Mixes.Not the kind of baking I enjoy.	1
8674	A24MW8SSP5G2UK	Remembering back to the WPA and the hard times of that period, I enjoyed Purgatory's  colusion of both world's and Mind over matter.	2
8675	A1J0OP6GTZKHR9	Needs editing, character building, and plot development. Regardless of these negatives, it was cute if random and I'd probably read the next even though the story is pretty ridiculous.	2
8676	A23BS90GTA9DX9	Did not seem to relate to this book at all. It did not keep me reading and not really well done. Will not buy any more by this author.	2
8677	A3DLN1BCLOGBNV	Cliche. Forced. Only got a third of the way through and was bored out of my mind. Advice to author: keep working on it because you ain't there yet.	0
8678	A31X2XA2PQ890F	Boring with cardboard characters.  I'm still waiting for the humour, no, I'm not, I quit reading and deleted it from my kindle!	1
8679	AD1E4MBIBUFUE	I had a hard time getting into this book, but I have read worse, so I don't want to really down the book.	1
8680	ALFGUMMTD7M4R	Sorry but the suspense wasn't that great and neither was the romance.  Predictable from the beginning.  Did nothing for me.	1
8681	A1AZ1NXGGP6LDX	Science fiction story that was short.  It gave an okay story about possible aliens coming to earth.  It was not a great story but okay for a short read.	2
8682	A1OSMDPFCEYAU5	Not a memorable tome in my opinion.  Just didn't engross me in it.  Cheap to buy, and not much to offer.	1
8683	A3VX3H5KTS8FXX	I really enjoyed it! Could have been longer but it was a great short story. I would recommend this book to anyone.	2
8684	A2QBCL3EFYR83N	Not much of a story and you have to buy the other books to finish it will not continue the series	0
8685	A8QK9AUDOVFWD	bit of a weak plot, but the characters are believable and the is a cohesive story. albeit a bit cliche.	2
8686	A2QLT5PSAEIXS6	This was an ok story. It seemed really rushed and ended rather quickly. I would have enjoyed it a little more had it been a more elaborate story.	2
8687	AE2IM7E5I3QLI	Its a good read, got better as it went along. I'm missing the dragons and magic, but hopefully its coming.	2
8688	A32C9GCLFSH98K	i LIKE BOOKS WESTERN/ROMANCE AND DID ENJOY THIS ONE.  THIS IS A FIRST FOR ME READING CIA LEAH'S BOOKS.DO YOU HAVE MORE OF HER BOOKS?	2
8689	A3GVWI36KNXTVO	Believable scenario, exciting, and an overall great read. Story line was good, characters filled out. I hope to see more of this group in the near future	2
8690	A2P9J05K20P0OW	Good story, a little short,but good. Got it free on book bub an  I would be disappointed if I'd have paid a regular book price.	2
8691	A3JONP3MGSSP0F	t started well and then it really was just erotica and not erotica romance. The plot really grinds down as does any character development. Not engaging really.	0
8692	AKWBRE0JKA2A1	Took a break and loaned it out and tried to read it again, but I just could become interested in this book.	1
8693	A9Q8N24BPF9PR	"The last two stories I couldn't finish - too weird with cross dressers and witches. Not my idea of ""holidays""."	1
8694	A2WEJP03KNXDPD	I am not a prude but this book is graphic.  I loved the story .  Just a little too much sex for me.	2
8695	A3290RQU1AB6IU	Was a very good read about love and how to work through it.  The characters were well rounded. Loved it!	2
8696	A3IGMZ1DLJRFPT	A complete waste of downloading time and storage space.  I would not have paid money to read this drivel.  Please, learn to write!	0
8697	A5W9GSMW5P3OH	I just didn't care for the series..it started out ok, but if there is another book,i think i will pass on it..	2
8698	AW8WGSQM8GBZE	I found the story line,something new and intersting. But the whole thing fell flat and towards the end of the book.Really didn't care what happened.	2
8699	A8H3WVK9NWWZP	Really this book (if you could call it that) was way too short & a waste really. &#34;Inked the Novel&#34; is awesome and didn't need that intro at all....	2
8700	A1T4HYVKAOF62W	The information in here is basic. It'd be a great guide for those new to writing sex scenes. But, doesn't offer much beyond M/M for a seasoned writer.	1
8701	A27L1KN0MM2MZI	No substance whatsoever in this short read.  Loved the idea of the characters, but there was no character development or plot development.	1
8702	AC1D9XWF98JVG	I think these were made as intro storylines to expands on in the future. If that is the case then bring them on........	2
8703	A2NQ5QACID1U71	I liked the premise of this book. Didn't follow through unfortunately. Went from friends to sex to a couple without much backstory.	1
8704	A2FDHNWDURIZ6V	a lot different then I thought it would be. but the plot was your basic men meets men, trouble follows...LOL	2
8705	A3694XMH3RDKTJ	I'm a huge zombie fan and liked the storyline. I look forward to reading the next book in the series!	2
8706	ABLQYZ8GVPKUE	It was alright. I didnt like the way it ended. The author does good work usually I just didnt like this one really	2
8707	A2JU11XGRJFH10	Personally, I'm not into drugs, but I thought this was a well written story and I enjoyed the scenes.  I liked the characters and story line.	2
8708	A2FHLW3NZVU3QM	In this book there are some good tips I will implement. most of it is common sense. The price was just right.	2
8709	A1JQQR9U4C0XKI	This story kinda move to fast I really didn't get a chance to know the characters in the book. That why I gave it 3 stars.	2
8710	A2AZZEHEV40Y1Z	A bit confusing....too much back and forth into other realms.  The ending was pretty freaky and unexpected!  I liked that!	2
8711	A1NFERLOZ3X9M4	The plot was a little thin, and somewhat of a disappointment.  A good lunchtime read, but not something to snuggle up with at night.	2
8712	A29DHL122HO5UZ	I got into this book a few pages and gave up.  It was not all that exiting.  Felt like a waste of my time.  Sorry!	2
8713	A3IPNF64L8R3RJ	not for me, I didn't realized what it was about but it was not for me that's for sure. Sorry.	0
8714	A15BQU0BRFNAS5	This story is pretty tame. Too much detail and not enough action for me. Could have developed the relationship between the characters more.	1
8715	A2UOAXHK3CVHVN	Not what I expected, wanted or liked.  Story is just bad.  It could be good, but the author didn't...try or finish?	1
8716	A3P9D9ZYQS5MMZ	"I COULDN'T get past the many "" I AND NICOLE"" I AND MARCUS, IT'S SO IRRITATING WHEN THE GRAMMAR IS RIDICULOUS."	2
8717	A3DPH1VWJF71SK	This whole book was predictable and yet I read it basically in one sitting so something about it I liked. Just a good enjoyable read.	2
8718	A2DQWWJ2HYR5C0	Dumb, dull, boring, predictable and nowhere near as clever as reputed. From now on I'll stick to Terry Pratchett. Lame tale.	1
8719	A3M5JMKPMAUDF3	ALL STORY IS A WOMAN DEDICATED TO BE A MAN AND SHE STEALS EVERYBODY THAT CROSS HER WAY, WILL SHE LIVE IN A  CONVENT,	0
8720	A3B1I3EC3O6MXO	This was my first book by Heather Long.  It was just ok.  It could have been a GREAT love story, but i felt it was too rushed.	2
8721	AD6KB2AZ7W1P7	Another story of deception and by what I call the boys in the basement. Always thinking they are so smart.	2
8722	AJV87JET57AB0	I didn't even read this book. Don't like to start something I can't finish. Might read the entire book if it was free.	0
8723	A2X7Q6WAYYSRHL	This was a different read for me, very technical...sometimes too clinical, not enough humor but different.  Won't be re-reading this one.	2
8724	A2CBOVOOK3Q6D4	A good beginning to this series. John and Michael are likeable characters and I look forward to see where this story will go.	2
8725	A1WLIX54U3ONQ7	After reading a couple of chapters into this book I lost interest and discontinued reading it. It was not my type of a book, but might be one for you.	1
8726	A68MOSR2NZID8	A very romanticized and poorly researched account of Amish community life.  Not even close to how this group of people live and work and react with the outside world.	1
8727	A1KC5D3Z1ZH38J	Good read easy.  Fun.  Hard to talk about a book easy to read not necessarily could be true. Hopefully though	2
8728	A1ZM4DHSCITGM1	Good of kind. Rather predictable but interesting characters. Light reading for relaxation and diversion from today's world. Give it a try.	2
8729	A2WUVRW9VRRHJ5	Simply boring book. There is no narrative or logic in the story....I would recommend to move to the next book if you see this title	0
8730	A3TK73QWC9BT9V	Though short, this wasn't short enough. No plot, boring characters, no heat, and the title is massively misleading. Thank goodness for free downloads.	0
8731	A16W9LA4OO54OT	I like this book, it was okay. The story was obvious, you can read it in one day, you can not connect with the characters.	2
8732	A1Z3JJE0E01UXM	I started it but the interest just wasn't there to finish it. With so many good books available, I don't wish to waste time on something substandard.	1
8733	A1C1TL7Y4D7A9H	with all that milk flowing in and out. I liked the story and it was hot. i am not sure I like the ending or not	2
8734	A1AHD5Z3UPI1AG	I like books that have sequels but this one didn't involve me as much as I thought it would . But it was okay	2
8735	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	Unfortunately it wasn't good.	1
8736	AD0LIOIQOLFDV	Entertainment  kept it light and a little funny. Some of the early American colonial language was a bother, and complicated reading it.	2
8737	A3L3BHR05F00B4	I give this 2 stars because I have read worse books. This book is very boring. Very &#34;yadda, yadda&#34; type. I don't recommend it.	1
8738	A55J2GX17YBK3	This book is confusing or I should say the characters are confusing.  It jumps all over the subject.  And uses bad language.  Lots of  arguing.  Couldn't figure out the plot.	1
8739	A8XOQ7VBLW32S	I felt this book was just meh or ok.The storyline had potential, but it didn't work for me. I felt like the story wasn't fully developed.	1
8740	A36TRE195P6Q24	Disappointed with the story line and confused with the meaning of a lot of the words and phrases that were used throughout the whole book	0
8741	A3886QZPJYV6Z5	I could not identify with any of the characters. The stories just seemed unreal even for science fiction. But that is just my opinion.	1
8742	A1OVVUSUQY4V9D	I was lost reading this book. A grand waste of time. No story line/plot. Would not recommend to anyone. weak/poor writing skills displayed by the author	0
8743	A3JH1L2JTX27EX	For such an old story, it was pretty good.  It wasn't like OMG I have GOT TO HAVE IT, but it wasn't bad either!	2
8744	A2O0P21DH5LQUQ	An easy read. Our goody two shoes the reverend detective really is rather stretched in this tale - seems to be no end to his talents.	2
8745	A1BL936C989IGO	I thought this a good read but more for teenagers perhaps, than adults. Older teens, though, due to sexual content.	2
8746	A35DLEU7FTK83H	Wow. One of the worst books I've read in a while. Really, nothing to it. Forced myself to read it all the way through because of my New Years resolution.	1
8747	A2I12Z52TW8GMB	Very average story with little romance and lots of continuous pursuit after the bad bug! Disappointing overall considering the blurb sounded exciting.	1
8748	A2U6W05N24JDB7	I chose the three star rating because this was  light, quick read.  The story line was good, the pace of the story interesting.	2
8749	APZ15I39E3A2W	No new information or eye opening info here. I was seeking info for my natural hair journey and nothing here related.	1
8750	AS3YP85NHDC2K	Really hot short story. Just found it hard to believe only one wolf stayed after finding a horny female!! IJS!!	2
8751	A1EVS6JYPZTW2J	Cute but not 3.99 cute... easy and fast read. Some hot little parts but in reality it should be a .99 book.	0
8752	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	Well written story, no editing problems and yet, I still didn't like this book. Why would a five year old dead boy, come back and torture his parents? Whatever.	2
8753	A2KP3BKN2QX0K9	This book is very interesting, it must be read with caution, and follow the instructions really carefully, and dont jump to doing everything without caution.	2
8754	A3AP3UG9LBT5WI	The only thing that bothers me were the numerous typo's. Otherwise a good solid series that leads into another and another and another.	2
8755	AZYYBBC73BQ	I liked this story but it is probably more geared to the female audience than for me. My girlfriend liked it but we couldn;t read it together.	2
8756	A17NRQIGP90UTE	uses a lot of the same cliches and even paragraphs from previous books.. character naming is a bit weird seems odd	2
8757	A7CZSRM0JJVJP	"liked the concept, love the characters, adore the cats.  very short story, too easily ""solved"".  haven't read the authors other books but looking forward to reading them."	2
8758	A1TCFBQD1CLUOC	Sorry, but there was no depth in the story line. It just didn't seem realistic. I kept reading because I read anything, but the story didn't keep me reading.	2
8759	AZB7MAHDCCHMW	A decent mystery story overwhelmed by too many bodies. This main character does not have to be a James Bond clone.	2
8760	ALTC2XJE67A7Z	Ok  this was not a story,it was too short for a story,it was a joke,l don't like someone calling this a book jokes on me	0
8761	A23ZVLTGUJXAME	A quirky little tale with a good ending, but, oh, it had the potential for so very much more. Too bad it wasn't more fully developed.	2
8762	ALDP7AL3407K1	I thought it was a great book, but the last three stories did not belong in the stories. They weren't sci-fi. I still liked most of the stories.	2
8763	A3RPJW5SFO8SGO	i finally ditched the book, just couldn't get interested in it.  Sorry to say i don't even remember why, i just finally gave up	1
8764	A2THFWCCS16D7N	Started reading the book, but found it to be trying and predictable, so didn't bother putting anymore time into reading it.	0
8765	A1B7514ASZYFZ9	It was a nice sexy read. But I didn't like the ending. Other than that I would recommend this book if you want a short spicy story	2
8766	A2WR8WQCYIE889	Really good ideas for losing weight.  I was really glad I downloaded this book to Kindle.  It's an easy read too.	2
8767	A3IQ5HVRNPSB0X	I read several of the books from this series and kept trying to find it to be something special, it just wasn't.	2
8768	A3608YKFAEO0C7	The main male character is a rude and basically a jerk. The female character is a push over. Don't waste your time.	0
8769	A17UQL76OCVR4F	I was disappointed with this book. All the recipes are the same except for an ingredient or two.  Too many ingredients for the recipes!	1
8770	ARX87X9VEXIXK	I really don't have a lot to say about this book. Some parts of it was good, but not all of it.	2
8771	AI67WH5Q659TU	I like futurisitc stories and I like westerns, but this mixture I hated. It just seemed absolutely clunky and weird.	0
8772	A29HTP3SLD38NL	I didn't really enjoy it. A lot of sex, not a lot of character development. Felt choppy. I just couldn't get into it.	1
8773	A2KALEV4WIZE80	Pretty hot! Will try more books by this author. This gets hot and steamy in a hurry and is a quick read.	2
8774	A20UE22HSZO7HD	I really couldn't get into this one....way too boring for me.  I thought it was a bit of false advertising.	0
8775	A3P0R0B6CWIAQF	To be honest it was very good.  Enjoyed it alot amd i cant wait to read more from lexi ryan. Great jobb ;)	2
8776	A23FKXZ5VNQUN7	I double checked my Kindle by author and by title and then by picture of the cover which may  or may not be.	0
8777	A2Q95CRI8CONPE	Not too bad for a free read. Amazon always has these nice and quick stories for bedtime reading. Or wherever else you would read this...	2
8778	A3EXU0KPSQMM	Good book. Was a little disappointed about how quickly Shawna went back to Ryan after what the did, but that is the only way you get to the HEA.	2
8779	AJTMQLVZCIEXC	If u want to read something about BDSM this book takes u there I did find it a little bit much on detail get to the pint already	2
8780	A4IQ85UZ366WO	It was so short that it's hard to rate this, but I enjoyed it and got a laugh from it.	2
8781	A2DZ6GYGVJYBWZ	I want to start by saying I hate short stories. This was just that a very short finish to end that left me waiting.	1
8782	A3ODOHEEC16U5J	Quick hot read. Delivered with hotness and, given the length limitation, the plot was good too. But of course, it's too short to be truly satisfying	2
8783	A1JMSX54DO3LOP	The book is so poorly formatted that I gave up on trying to read it.I might try to read an updated version.	1
8784	A1IJBYQYBRRCD3	I liked the book ,but thought it was a little slow at first.  Once I got into it  though, I couldn't wait to finish it.	2
8785	A331ZGF95P9725	Nothing really wrong with the stories but did not keep my interest past reading the book.	2
8786	A10110731ARQJ54630ME1	I was disappointed in this.It was not actually what I was expecting.And it was quite short too.Sorry	0
8787	A3P44N4J5KBL8D	started off ok storyline, but was still lacking something overall. Just didn't find it a page turner would not recommend.	2
8788	AHAEANOM7OQAD	Way too many characters to keep up with and needed a better story line..Who knows what happened to the Innkeeper????	2
8789	A1EBATTFRJC7JG	Did not care for this book and did not finish it. I've been spoiled by better writers and did not enjoy this book.	1
8790	A1GMNY1ME8Y1M3	Ok, Pamfiloff must be desperate.  Another cliff hanger?  It's like a juvenile short story with the classic ending, &#34;and then I woke up!&#34;	2
8791	AW57T8LH9MXAO	I didn't really care for this book.  Story was too predictable and the characters too blah.  Not my kind of romance.	1
8792	A1VC48UV57XWOH	They were nice read for short stories. They were about abusive marriage. How the woman handled the after affect of it	2
8793	A3CLGJ1ZO4Z5T5	It is not horrible, but it is boring, and too short for any story or relationship to develop. I am glad I did not have to pay for it.	1
8794	AZD74VERJY2LP	Straightforward and to the point, it was a decent book it had its twists and turns but I felt like something was missing	2
8795	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	Don't quit your day job, just yet. The promise of becoming a good writer is there, but not quite yet.	0
8796	A2OAJX7CMKHOSD	Ingredients are not readily available in my small town, I needed dishes both liw in carb but with regular ingredients	1
8797	AIFF81UGO3SRZ	a fun read if you can step past the bad writing and predictable plot, A book obviously written by a scientist as heavy on science and light on fiction...	0
8798	APX2YKOFIYYRI	"Not a bad book for a pre teen.. .. .. I do enjoy stories that have "" old gods"" , Oracle s and prophesies"	2
8799	A2X6NT8BL6G2HG	"I have always enjoyed Bartholomew's books but this one I'm  sorry I bought. I finished it, waiting for ""something"" but all it was, was confusion. Disappointed"	1
8800	A22HFPSIJU2T2Z	Much  like all the other mail order brides & husbands stories. Was still a good short read. I  enjoyed it.tv	2
8801	A179ZGXWA4RW3Q	Funny, very short, but typical TS humour. I like reading this author's funny stories. Hope we get more from her.	2
8802	A0229119WYOGTKRDOJCQ	I can barely remember the story, if there really was one.  Sorry, this book did not appeal to me at all.	0
8803	A16NOA3DB7G1SR	It's not a bad book, but the story and characters could have been a bit more developed.  The story was lacking a certain pizzazz.	2
8804	A31G4MNGZNYSZI	"Family drama and Greek culture spin an unusual tale, based on the belief ""no divorce"". Mixed cultures murder twist a homicide investigation. Odd but encouraging ending."	2
8805	A271ONHHXG5Q8C	the author tells a tale of the magical and fairy tale world and how it coexists with ours.  a fun read.	2
8806	A13YVJ64W0AT5F	It was different for me in reading matter.  I did enjoy the short story, and the good ending it provided.	2
8807	A2FYPQ85QHGT0G	SoIt was an okay story with cute illustrations. Relied heavily on the phrase wiggle wiggle boom. So much so that it has become hackneyed.	1
8808	A3OI6HYOXO2OT1	I didn't finish this book i hate when first chapter catches your attention then you buy and nothing keep you readimh	1
8809	A207KD17K9PH3	Scifi setting. (M/F) short story, really fast paced.  Story could've been built up, fleshed out more.  Sex was pretty banging, though.	2
8810	A1L7ST1P0VB9H	Not what I expected.  I like mysteries and I couldn't stay focused on this story,  I may go back and finish it, but for now, I'm reading something else.	0
8811	A3801AFH5JO56U	Felt like the author could have wrapped everything up in this book. It was a good story. I like the charcters.	2
8812	A265UILPJEMOWL	Interesting, but not sure I want to read the rest of the series.	2
8813	A1RZ0S7AYVY7SU	It was alright. started out well and then went down hill. It's hard to believe that anyone would continuously put themselves in the middle of a police investigation.	1
8814	A3K6ZDAUL3VG2N	It took a while to  get into the story and the characters but once I did  I enjoyed the two stories	2
8815	A2F7DPMF1ACIOP	It goes into more detail than I care for . The job wasn't interesting to me . I couldn't get into it .	2
8816	ASMZHKN1SBTJV	I enjoyed it but I felt it was a little boring at the end. Eve Vaughn  is a really good writer	2
8817	A3G7OLIC03JCOC	This was cute. It's a really, really short story. I just wish there was more to it.	2
8818	A10WMML86IHKIG	Connolly is good when he steps away from his Bosch series but I always feel a little cheated. I would still recommend The Safe Man. Especially to Connolly followers.	2
8819	A1RBZETXXP854I	Love this author but just came off of her Konigsburg TX series which next to impossible to beat , so thus book was pale in comparison.	1
8820	AJ6FGBQU6JVPC	Did not enjoy at all..... Poor writing skills. An Asian heroine made the story even worse.... I don't understand how this book got 4 stars.	0
8821	A85Q1FA1LCIRV	Pre-ordered this, got it, wished I had the reviews before I bothered.  This is not a real story.  THought it was misloaded.	0
8822	A39VLK71KR3F5P	This was a good book to read and I love reading ghost stories. My only complaint is that the book is too short!	1
8823	A2YNUFKQF48440	Fortunately this book did not cost much in time or money.  It was very poorly written.  An OK idea, poorly executed and poorly developed.	0
8824	A507FZLE1KQ1D	This book was definitely a quick and easy read. It had a good story line that kept a smooth flow.	2
8825	A1P5HZ6FDLRLTN	fun to read it, but it is not too interesting for my little daughter.But maybe it fit other little kids	2
8826	A32PYP772QZE4T	This short book is a nothing-new gathering of what-you-already-knew suggestions, which includes &#34;woo&#34; like aromatherapy and Vitamin C uncritically. Why waste your time?	1
8827	AECU7Z8OBP694	.99 why not. 4 very short stories about alpha men and there women want more can I say...Quick way to pass some time..	2
8828	ANMODBIUN7ZJP	I was amazed at the stuff I learned by reading this book .it was very interesting .thanks slot for this book.	2
8829	A2AA6XJ6ZPU52I	A shirt story that's continued..who does that? Maybe a full book or something but a short story.. good read but still who does that.!	2
8830	A2EWO6RKBVKQFH	Well this was a little too much for me to enjoy. I am not big on mixed scify and fantasy so I just could not finish the book.	1
8831	A35TFY1439H7E6	This was a very short book.  In the space available, the author did a reasonable job of introducing standard pile and worm-bin composting.  Really could have used some more details.	2
8832	A3T2XXV5Z12ANQ	The male character was a bit unrealistic in his actions. I enjoyed the female character however. The secondary characters were just the right amount of cute and nosy.	2
8833	A28LEGTRT35UPA	I like Selena Kitt, but this is just boring.  After reading, removed from my device.  Maybe if it were longer and went somewhere.	0
8834	A6FGBWP16BB6M	Fast pace, plenty of action and a decent story line.But always leaving the reader with more questions than answers.A very good read , more than worth the price	2
8835	A2Y8Z7JST7GNHA	All that glitters - 3 starsTo buy a wife - 2 starsEnslaved by starlight - 4 starsOverall a nice 3 in 1 each story was a nice length.	2
8836	A3QPF2O1ZP6CA4	This was a okay book. It dragged to much for me. I do like the fact that the author tallied about real life situations.	2
8837	A1L77PDGA6IRNR	If the recovery where only that simple . NO old debt haunting them what a deal . Enemy countries that don't retaliate in kind .	1
8838	AM0AQ3VUR77XR	Loved the concept, but this book was too short and ended in a cliffhanger so I was disappointed.  Just when I was getting to know the characters, it was over.	2
8839	A1CG6B67LK7VQZ	This book was okay, but did not hold my attention like previous books by this author. Kind of disappointed. Will read other books by this author in the future.	2
8840	A2TJIU9F2N9P00	It was good, but there are a lot of free erotic stories out there that I would recommend over this.	2
8841	ADAXUAWC0C4Q4	I personally did not like this book at all and did not bother to finish it.  Not good writing, poor story line.	0
8842	A32Z989XAEZLOH	This was another teaser.  There were no stories.  There was nothing to read.  I was very disappointed and won't try this group of authors again.  Sorry.	1
8843	A3MQ92M9OJJBU1	It might be interesting to children, but beyond that not so much.  The one about the transexual acrobat probably isn't proper for children to read.	0
8844	A1Q3IWKRS8VKT6	Greta story line, but remember you are paying about 2 bucks a CHAPTER for this book. So remember whe you see  $1.99 it is not for the whole book.	2
8845	A13YUYAODD2PLM	This was a good book, you need to read it to keep up with the series, but I like reading Turner and Naomi's point of view better...	2
8846	A1UU6ZTEW7ERWC	This was not my type of book.  Not what i expected i did not read the brief discription completely. that was my problem.	0
8847	A6HR56H4V52BT	Most was something to look up when cooking.  Easy to read and apply to your needs.  i will keep it for referance	2
8848	A3M02F4LQKSEKB	It seemed that the story was missng key pieces I wasn't able to keep up with the plot it went from here to there with no transtition.	1
8849	A2J1YURKRKJ6N6	I definitely did not expect it to be so short! I think parts of it could've been developed more, but it was a good story!	2
8850	AK9JHBJYQ6UC0	This wasn't what I was expecting. I didn''t realize it was a memoir.  I will have to be more careful with my purchases in future.	2
8851	A2TJVLRKL0VJCA	Haven't tried any of these yet, so I will remain neutral on my evaluation. Ones most interested in are the ones for gardening.	2
8852	AJ1R2TTE8ZAFC	Overall disappointed in Book 4 as again I read the three prior books and wanted to see what happened, but was disappointed overall with the Story.	2
8853	A19W1EMTMIQJRT	This book was okay.  I have enjoyed other books by Lucia Jordan better than this one, but I would recommend it.	2
8854	A1FXPKJXX3Z42J	This is like the middle section of the book and only possibly 2 chapters. It is not the entire book which would be interesting if put together.	2
8855	A1BZW3BDE8QN7P	Fun characters  good description of charactersIf you are not someone who thinks tea leaf and pendulum use ok then you may not want to read	2
8856	A85DSKH4E8I3I	Since I now OWN  KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 and KINDLE FIRE, I seldom use my original KINDLE e-READER; but this guide is very useful for that KINDLE.	2
8857	A30PG24ES4G9SJ	I guess this is okay for a rainy afternoon. But it is a silly read. Really really silly. It could be worse, however. It wasn't offensive.	1
8858	A269V1751J5SWF	This book  I co u of take or leave it. I do think it was a good read. I just didn't get into it very well.	2
8859	A14VOOOGIF1BS3	I wouldn't rate this book to highly, not very interesting to me at least. Everyone has to judge for themselves if they like it or not, I wouldn't recommend it.	2
8860	A48TM09R7C5YU	Unfortunately, this one didn't meet the expectation the the first had set.  Somewhat yawn inducing, the characters fell flat.  It's really too bad because I really enjoyed the first.	1
8861	A2V0IOF8CYD9F8	This was fine. I. Thought it could be better but I have read a lot of many books that much much better.	0
8862	AFOXJC4S8ME1H	I personally did not enjoy all the stories. Some were actually quite good. I just stopped reading and went on to another Silo book.	2
8863	A3VAUHAEZ8YWQF	Okay but you get kind of stuck wanting to finish the series.i do enjoy the quick reads of each book.	2
8864	A1AEP2DFI28WJE	This book was okay, but not a &#34;keeper.&#34;  I read it primarily because of one of the authors, Michele Hauf, I had enjoyed other books she had written.	2
8865	A2CCO4HWIFOP5J	Nothing special a pretty good horse opera. The story moves along well enough. It's just nothing special. Worth the price. A quick read.	2
8866	A1TP5BUX7VBHM3	Nowhere in the description did it say this was a BDSM story. I didn't even get past the first chapter.	0
8867	A2JQVCPI9HC72W	Yawn.  After 3rd chapter I skipped to end.  Just wasn't engaged and found character of sassy irritating.  I expected a taming of the shrew type scenario.	0
8868	A2RY2WZFFKI8YL	The story was weak.  Older woman on vacation falls in love with her boat captain who is really a millionaire.	1
8869	A3CMIEYL0TJLC2	I like it but it was to short for me ok I wish there was more in the story instant of waiting for the next one	2
8870	A2P4V8YMA5LJ8X	Pretty silly, not remotely titillating. Instead of intense stimulating sexual banter, there are puns and almost clinical descriptions of sex.	1
8871	A1MFUAAGOS2KH3	He is a royal Fae, immortal and endowed with more than eye candy looks. She is the Sister of his friend and she is human, mortal	2
8872	A2Z8A1W957DXRU	This was an okay story but like a clockwork book, it cannot hold a candle to a real Poe tale.	2
8873	A3RX7I1M9IR2TA	It was a good book, i loved the movie she picks out to watch!  Good plot keep you wondering what was going to happen	2
8874	AFIH80GNTHP5C	I like short stories, but this was way hurried. No need to make things seem perfect in so little pages	1
8875	AUQL0H1CVZR7F	Easy and entertaining reading up to being nice. But for me it wasn't awesome as some other novel authors' novels.	2
8876	A1K061Y0QRFWP0	Far fetched, unbelievable, and kind of boring. I wouldn't waste time on reading this. I wasn't even interested enough to see what happens in the next book.	0
8877	A398QTLZZGA1YK	Good read. Free on amazon . Wish I had connected with the charters more.otherwise a pretty enjoyable read. Would recommend	2
8878	A1ESF76N9NLS0P	Good idea but a little hyped up.  It is a really quick read and I'd be mad if I paid four bucks for just this.  Three stars.	2
8879	A1CTXFV36Y7P7Y	I skimmed so much I got to the point where I didn't know what was going on anymore and I didn't mind. It wasn't for me.	0
8880	A10VOCB4MEIKXE	Received Kindle Touch and this was ordered with it.  I am not sure whether I am keeping the Kindle but they item did arrive within time frame.	2
8881	A2076BGSWD0A7K	I never got engaged with any of the characters. The author does a good job with the story and it was a very interesting read about how Britain was surviving.	2
8882	A2PC87B87NM6SW	Good read - quick! Hot scenes rather quickly too! It's a short book so not that involved, but that's not why you read a short. It's a good quick ride!	2
8883	A28MU7I5NYWHVP	This book was actually better than I though it would be.  The story had some substance and kept my attention throughout the book.	2
8884	AIAE6MCLRW3KW	I'll rethink buying the short stories in the future.  It was a not-so-good very short story followed by the advertisement for her newest book which I've already read.	0
8885	A1PCDLGQHRMX4I	A very interesting but very short story.  I am looking forward to reading  more of Steve Berry's.  The future meeting of these characters should be great.	1
8886	A3DYRJTT39W8P7	Still not feeling this story especially as most people are still on the &#34;poor Paige&#34; wagon.	0
8887	A28GJ81UC1CPTB	Have not finished the story. So far to unbeliveable, how people crash car into brick walls, get shot and just move onto next scene , as if nothing happen.	2
8888	AZLOCW6YBVSLS	good thing this was free but i want my 15 min of life back. the story was disheartening. the charecters unlikeable. the ending abrupt.	0
8889	A1DWNTB0KO74L7	It was okay, but not what I was looking for.  I didn't find anything I couldn't live without.  Don't recommend it.	2
8890	ABW8ZL231G2TP	The dialogue jumps around annoyingly, the characters are simplistic and the writing is bad.  Even free, this book isn't worth it.	0
8891	A3OZQECDH529BO	Very predictable format.  Really didn't care how things turned out for anyone in this book.  Didn't bother to finish whole series.	2
8892	AZZ5CX19QSNR3	Pretty formulaic. Not horrible. Some fun parts but all around just sort of meh. A Little Complicated (by the same author) had much better character development and a richer story.	2
8893	A3AQKF73Y2VWTL	I never not finish  a book but this one was so painfully dull I just couldn't take it. Sorry to the author for the bed review.	0
8894	A3ETCZDCWQ5XDX	These stories were very redundant. A name & scene change, but basically the same. I didn't even read them all.	0
8895	A2CGCBUQE92DC8	Thought it would be a bit more detailed.  However, most of the information was available some time ago.  I will read it again.	2
8896	A35KF1CYL39HPQ	The First by Jason Mott is a good short story where you get a chance to read a sweet short story before you read the whole book, The Returned.	2
8897	A1QS3RS34AAEOU	Not as good as I expected in an Italian Cook Book.  I found little that I would like to make and eat.	1
8898	A3HIOH3S2TH5SB	Not an enjoyable book. Crazy plot line, stupid in general. Don't download unless you enjoy reading stupid books, as I do.	0
8899	A1RQC2Z0JYO3SV	It had my attention, but it fell short and I was bored from about chapter 2 on out. I'm halfway through so hopefully it'll pick up.	1
8900	A2EJ7C8EMJ745E	By the time I got to the end I hadn't a clue what was going on.  The book made absolutely no sense.  I would not recommend it.	0
8901	A2XKAWE6ZFRZQZ	I want to continue reading not because it's a good book. but because I've invested time on now and I need to know how it ends. the end	1
8902	A3U1DCM4843JCX	I liked the suspense presented throughout this novel but I was disappointed with the use of foul language,the storyline could have been much better without the bad language.	2
8903	ASRVZ2UL6O4RC	I loved the chemistry between Nique and her girls. They were down for each other and don't let anyway come between them. The book had a great storyline.	2
8904	A2KT16MZQW7XGI	I found the projects interesting, just haven't made anything yet, so can't tell you how they turned out or if the instructions are easy to understand.	2
8905	AKER8L9DYV3OE	Really didn't enjoy the book. Main character was unbelievable naive and very annoying. Very unrealistic behaviour from all characters, especially the main character. Not very exciting.	0
8906	A3SR6J48N94G0M	&#34;I received this book for an honest review&#34;very well-written book and short story about young man point of view about his life...3 out of 5 star'sOlivia R.	2
8907	A2PY4WEXDQO0UC	This was boring it took me 2 weeks maybe three to read this book, thank God it was free I would have been upset if I bought this one.	1
8908	A2YJB95TWW15BH	I have read quite a few of the stories by Hechti, this one is harder to get into than any of the others.	2
8909	A3DQU9H0AN61Q6	I did not care for this book It was not what i had expected i to be so i only read a small portion of it	1
8910	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	Not a bad story. It's been done before, but then what hasn't? Good writing and editing. I would recommend this story to someone who's much younger than I am.	2
8911	A3QX8U9R7L2S6H	Part 1 is really good, I have a feeling part 2 will be even better.  Good job Susan. I liked it.	2
8912	A3BWB47WZIF9Q6	I think children's rhyming books need a good flow and rhythm especially when being read aloud. Some of the rhymes in this book just didn't flow off the tongue smoothly.	1
8913	A2W2RQ790XHQQP	Great disappointment.Nikola Tesla was a fascinating person. This 'book' is basically a rephrased Wikipedia entry. It would require quite a stretch of the imagination to call it a biography.	0
8914	A9EJ3VSGUNA9I	This book is ok, it started out good and than start getting a little choppy.  Some parts went a bit to fast, but the ending is good!	2
8915	A3TKUFBYNY8SBW	It would have been a very interesting historical romance but it's just the beginning sequel to the Highland Moonlight Spinoff by Teresa Reasor.	2
8916	AF8R0V93DLSAU	This was a long story with a small amount of romance. I was disappointed.  Hope the next book is better.	2
8917	A3F1A4Z8YIX5PW	Not one of his better books.  Short stories with no ending. His other books are awesome. I was very disappointed in this one after reading all his others	0
8918	A2RFDYRINMEJLS	I am not sure I would recommend this book.  It was alright but could have used so much more to it.  Great concept but not enough follow through	2
8919	A2BLMYSOETI6OQ	Not saying it's not a good book, just wasn't what I had thought when purcahsing. I'm not into historical western romance and it was my error in buying.	1
8920	A1T2FQU9XBINN1	This was a nice beginning to something that seem like it might be epic I also have the bankroll squad books	2
8921	A3ZFKT4U0Q9V0	A very good topic but it should be a lot longer,and more detailed.But is was kinda good.SIGNED THE AWESOME PLATYPUS.	2
8922	A227JEN1MQGIWE	Boring and predictable. Passed over most pages just to get to the end. Don't waste your time or money, not worth it.	1
8923	AZD3BY8FQAGL5	How many episodes do I have to buy before something happens?Regan is still acting like an idiot.Maybe I expect too much.	2
8924	A3TMTS14P58ITP	Wow, I was thinking this is going to be a mind tingling story. Then it ended!! What a let down.,	1
8925	A10ED33F8VY4GU	while the story moved slowly along the sex was very vivid. Not a bad story and has good characters it just moves slowly.	2
8926	A33QR6AJCFS35H	I couldn't get past the first chapter. Unbelievable, these things do not happen at least not that quick. I did not finish and would say don't waste your time.	0
8927	A3QS93OUJRO02J	Short, crazy and killer the cut up is def something that most of us have wanted to do but never did	2
8928	A3HC0NLQ5G7J4Z	this was a complete waste of time - glad it was free.  Not much more to say about it. Lousy editing too.	0
8929	A1NMUPG3KMWRZM	Ok wasn't for me so many things was going couldn't really get into the characters whatsoever. I guess I'll will say it wasn't my cup of tea.	2
8930	A1K1Z8XHZLATOJ	This book just cannot seem to hold their interest. My children love books. This one though, just doesn't seem to do it. Not sure why.	2
8931	A3FCGR4W58WQPA	the book started out really good, but I think there was another book before this one. there is another book after this one because this ended in a cliff hanger.	1
8932	A1ELQWH2G9NY7C	Pretty short story, not bad. Kept me interested and grossed out. Got it while it was free which is great.	2
8933	A2ZPJU052MJ5EM	Not sure is this is a ghost story, love story or how to clean a house.  I enjoyed the books and look forward to reading the rest of the series.	2
8934	A29877BG4PRHFZ	I have been enjoying the &#34;Invasion&#34; series, however this last book has not impressed me as much. Slower paced maybe?	1
8935	A39W3AS7QSDQ9Y	Certainly not what I expected but still held my interest	2
8936	A3AGMR9KWZZ4PD	Well this is definitely considered erotic.  Quite detailed sex scenes.  I liked the characters, they just were in bed a lot!	2
8937	A6MKL2T9WGONJ	I guess I didn't read the description of book well enough. Don't mind romance type books. I enjoy them in fact but this was a bit much even for me.	0
8938	A3VHWAM2IM4Z6W	This story was boring. I don't even understand why it was written. The story wasn't worth the time to read it . Didn't bother.	0
8939	A1219MSUEL0711	Another good story. Loved the writings of this author. Captivating. Hot sex. Well developed characters. Keep the stories coming PLEASE!	0
8940	A36VJAW6JCP0RV	Poor organization of content makes this very hard to read. The stories are great, of course, but it is frustrating to use in this format.	1
8941	A27945SA0F2Z35	Not a lot I didn't have some sort of recipe for. Probably good for beginning vegetarians or those who just want to eat lighter.	2
8942	AB5DP7AM479QJ	it would be nice to have a little longer story other than sex but the scense were steamy... worth if free	2
8943	A1NDTNDH1NWF7D	One of those books, you really wanna like but unfortunately the characters turn out severely retarded and totally turn you off.	1
8944	A19QW89NCQ3W15	THis series has been dragged on too long!! Ella needs to give them HEA and end the series !!! I had a hard time getting through this book	0
8945	ANLG8TMUID5NC	But if you are into Kings and Queens turning their son's nursemaid into your personal adult nursemaid and sex toy... then this is the story for you.	2
8946	A38D8C5NUUWZK3	this is the first in a series from another series' spin-off. I would call it a cozy mystery. it's fun, light reading	2
8947	A1KF1FXZRPAFIG	ANOTHER FINDING THE SUSPECT,  KEPT ME REDING THE BOOK ,SUSPRISED I DID NOT SOLVE THE  CASEGOOD READING MATERIAL,	2
8948	ARMZUNUSAZJZG	Are worth reading. The entire book could be 4 pages long. The rest is advertising for the authors other books.	0
8949	A1FCBMIIXBNDL2	I would prefer to know this is just an advertisement before I waste my time reading it. Some people might like that OK, but I don't.	1
8950	A2BD62MRYYGUXT	This book was more a so-so for me. Neither the story line nor any of the characters drew me in.	1
8951	A2F43ZCDNT1FYF	It was ok I like historical romances anyway so I read constantly I like anything that has to do with history.	2
8952	A3MMTMDE3H6WJQ	The writing is very bad at times.  Sentences are long and confusing.  I want to love it but I can't.	2
8953	AXICH3O86MNUX	I like the premise, I like the idea fo him laying his proposition out front for her to decide. I wish the serial was a book instead.	2
8954	A37Q4QBRUK76DW	Interesting love story. The characters backgrounds are believable. The locations of England and Greece are a breath of fresh air.	2
8955	AD6KB2AZ7W1P7	Interesting information. For us in rural areas I think it's helpful. I'll try some of these and see what happens	2
8956	AAB7H3JETCS5A	This book had moments of entertainment but unfortunately it started to really drag. I did finish it but I'm not interested in reading any more of the series.	2
8957	A20UE22HSZO7HD	A very wordy story that took forever to get anywhere and then disappointed in the end.  Not one of the better books I have read lately.	0
8958	APV9TYO0K6NFS	I always take jokes to my Dr.'s appointments for his children.  Hence this book.  It was okay, at least his kids enjoyed the jokes.	2
8959	A2A9HNQQTK6XII	Interesting premise...but  author seemed to need to make up witch rules as she went along to conveniently help the heroine get out of jams .love interest stiff and boring.	1
8960	A383RRJFO33TDD	It took me half way through the book to find the point of the story. Very shallow plot that barely was there.	2
8961	ATP35BHAUS1C6	Still not impressed. So far not worth the money I paid for this series. So far I would NOT recommend this series.	1
8962	A2OPU7YBR9HWTC	Their sweetness is overwhelming and trite.  The story has a good mystery plot but way to much detail about their every emotion.  Quick read.	2
8963	A16XLKV7C415XC	I enjoyed a the story, I think the author could have explored a little more depth. This story could have easily been expanded. Still, it was enjoyable.	2
8964	A11TT460OXJPVA	This story is for someone who likes a light mystery laced with irony.  I prefer a deeper, more complex story that will keep me on edge.	2
8965	AN3SSTS24R3EJ	The writing was good; the story line was predictable.  This was,a good romantic read, but a bit boring.  Not a book I couldn't wait to get back to reading.	2
8966	A2J5MRGGV7H7K2	I wasn't impressed.  Maybe next time.  I just didn't get revved up about this book.  It could use a little more umph!	1
8967	A2ZTSA2T9PK98I	Sorry I love Kathryn Shay's other books but this time travel book just didn't do it. After reading the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon nothing can compare. Sorry Kathryn.	1
8968	A37SUCB2CDONY3	I didn't enjoy this compilation of stories much.  Very ecclectic and strange. Mostly the authors were boring and verbose. Hope you like it better.	2
8969	A3KCT9YXRCCADA	I don't understand this book, if this is the beginning,then I will really be confused if I read another book.	1
8970	A20DHT8BPBOCP8	The recipes seem fine. However it is difficult to navigate since there is no index or table of contents. It really needs a table of contents.	1
8971	A10Y597K071WTQ	This book is sad because Evie lost her only family left so I'm hoping the part will be better. It's very well written.	2
8972	A2TCSSXBEZ9EY6	But I wish there were more of them.  I also thought that the book was s little light on regular content . . . More, please.	1
8973	A1C1TL7Y4D7A9H	me a little wet, hot and bothered. I enjoyed this story. I know I will read more by this author.	2
8974	A3EH22Q19MJBCC	the first book was pretty good, but then the character changed quite drastically and I grew very impatient with her &#34;new attitude&#34;.	2
8975	A1CYXFNCMDZKJ	But hard core it isn't.  Read if you're in the mood for simplicity and relaxation.  Not complicated, good straightforward plotting fun characters.	2
8976	A2P8FDN8TEI4WZ	It was ok. The story over all was ok except parts were just drown out. Apart from that miss Lisa Scott this book was very interesting.	2
8977	A2VYMNYX5LBAKV	The book managed to be useful and informative. It had many answers that other guides didn't cover, but I still had many questions.	2
8978	A2PHXLD0X3M8RD	Assault, rape, attempted murder, ritual murders, mysterious strangers, odd happenings are all present with very serious consequences in store for those opposing Omar.	2
8979	A223T998MPEEWS	A very good book kept your interest through out the whole thing the more you read the more you wanted to read on	2
8980	ASBYG0MY7DTID	Was an ok book didn't like the girls mom or her uncle. Nathan I loved, Nicole was ok. Could of been a better book	2
8981	A1E5313URAFTE1	Did not realize until later that this was not what I thought it was.  Very disappointed. Glad it was free.	0
8982	A3AIPHJRBNTN6Z	Action pack story with a multitude of sub plots.  I feel the ending was rushed, especially the Bath of Blood conversion.	2
8983	A3ANEDEST4WCZQ	What a cliffhanger. Delightful story line. Can't wait for the follow-up. Definitely recommend for your reading enjoyment.  Great plot. Should one settle?	2
8984	A30BOWOXG8C6CP	OK for small children but nothing exceptional. Cute animal pictures you can find lots of places. Would have liked to have seen a few descriptions that encouraged children to explore	2
8985	A2TUH0Y4KUWM17	Text runs into each other. Hard to follow the story line. Not a good book. Don't download. To confusing to follow.	0
8986	A1GHV20HSBV5Z	Pretty HOT. I loved that the 2 guys in the story,became Dom,and Sub, only in their dreams,then finally found each other in real-life.	2
8987	A1C1TL7Y4D7A9H	right amount of heat and I have enjoyed reading this story. The characters are very cliche and predictable but it doesn't matter.	2
8988	A3K8CP1S83UY7	This book is very interesting but every single guy in this book asks for sex on the first encounter of meeting her.	2
8989	AS3YP85NHDC2K	I have no clue what I just read or what happen. Very glad I didn't pay for this mess!! What a buzzkill!!	0
8990	A1EET132V3FY0V	Although I enjoyed reading this book, it is entirely too short. But having said that, it is still worth reading.	2
8991	A3HO302JT2N85Q	Let me say up front that I have not read this book. Why? When there are glaring grammatical errors in the book description I won't waste my time.	0
8992	A1PDIJDV23K31K	This story had some real possibilities, but it needs some serious editing. I appreciate that Laurel is becoming a strong character.	2
8993	APVBHEP4HN2E3	Would recommend Steven King not be associated with this book. Total waste of time and disappointment. Boring to say the least!	2
8994	A3AW5WHOHQ5J3W	Unlikely premise, shallow, typical romance novel, and I would not read it again. A good novel should have something that brings you back again.	0
8995	A12UDATYZEMM20	Same beginning for each story and so you know what is going to happen. If it was free then by all means it should pass a few hours for you.	1
8996	A25R4PWNS0TKOZ	how to be an indie author.  I enjoyed it for that reason.  However, I found a VERY few editorial problems, and unfortunately am anal enough that it bothered me.	2
8997	A1CBSU5DTMYX3E	This is another twist on fallen angels. It's pretty good. Enough that I read the first book in the series also.	2
8998	A3DPH1VWJF71SK	Short quick read that's fun. Nice introduction to the authors style of writing, which makes you want to read the next in the the series.	1
8999	A1U2RD5JK9XLKA	I couldn't get past the first two chapters in this book.  The characters didn't interest me enough to continue further.	1
9000	ALFGUMMTD7M4R	Nothing to write home about but decent.  Characters were believable, but the storyline was just a bit too far off.	2
9001	AC6D2LO2C3PIH	I thought this was more of a novella than a full length book. I really wished it was longer. It was well written but left me wanting more.	2
9002	A1OJ3G5TH883QS	I WISH THIS WAS LONGER BUT FOR A HOUR READ IT REALLY WAS NICE.  I HOPE I CAN READ A LONGER STORY BY THIS WRITER.	2
9003	A1CTXFV36Y7P7Y	Super weird. I had trouble finishing it. Maybe it's just not my genre, I don't know, but I couldn't get into it.	0
9004	A2WJQO88ULQ74M	Easy read with info written in as brief manner. Not as much info as I'd hoped for. A couple of good recipes however.	1
9005	A11JXQ8AJ8UX45	This is the second book I read by this author and I truly believe she needs to take English again.	0
9006	A5S7RYEMFZLCS	It had a good beginning and then it lost me.  I read other books by author so this was unexpected.  Despite that i had yo finish	0
9007	A2PGF8GB1MTCYW	This was a light read, it was okay, but you could put the book down and come back to it	1
9008	AYVJY4Z9CYQWU	I appreciated that the book was written in honor of a real-life director of a women's shelter. The story was a pleasant, but short, old-lovers-reunited romance.	2
9009	A1WYAH2LZVV3G1	The story kept me interested in spite of the sometimes stiff dialog and the malaprops.  Really needs an editor and proofreader.	2
9010	A1AIA0J6B2AGCM	are these people reading the same book I was? it's beyond boring and predictable. all the stories seem to be the same, only with different character names, save your money	0
9011	A2OBP105FXX7I0	I read the reviews and I was a little disappointed with the actual book it was a little weak l expected more but I will read another book by Simone.	2
9012	A1NHSGG1YJ2M9I	The story line is interesting but I found the writing to be inconsistent.  The violent thoughts and behavior of the main character grew monotonous.	0
9013	AC9AFG8PVGXJD	I guess I was looking more for national news than entertainment...not my type of news, so not too pleased. Sorry.	2
9014	A1J5DBIEI2ULMM	this books was not my type of reading, i didnt finish it. I like a little heat but not this much.	1
9015	A1PAH17OXRT8U9	I gave it 10 chapters, then figured life was too short to waste on a book this boring. Lots of narration, nothing going on here.	0
9016	A3I8XXBQ4CTXJ9	The story was good but would have been better had it been longer, you know more substance.  I finished it in 30 mins.	2
9017	A27MGR6EIGNFJO	The characters got  me invested  and left me wanting more. Also it started with so much action but tapered off in the end.  Very anticlimactic.	2
9018	A39K3N5HBOHQNN	This book was just okay to me because it seemed all over the place. I thought it was going to be better.	0
9019	A28DMVM1R0A3LM	I didn't make it far into this one. Shallow, uninteresting characters that I just couldn't bring myself to spend time with, within the first few dozen pages.	0
9020	AVJ8F6IFNLC4E	Very good book and kept me reading until the end.  Needed to be longer, but I will be looking for more books.	2
9021	A4FO863NWSYD5	This book was okay. Rory and Hindley' s past are finally revealed and they have to move past their insecurities.	2
9022	A19Z17YLMTW78U	Good book about manners. I could see using this in a preschool or kindergarten classroom! Catchy rhyme and good message about manners.	2
9023	A194ULIXW7XOCO	The book started good but the end make it the worst it's not a full book dnt waist your money.	0
9024	A25USTSPX55Y2X	I did finish this book but found the main character a bit trashy rather than a feminist icon. I probably wouldn't read another book by this author.	1
9025	A2BUBI9LD0U1NN	I wouldn't read the rest of the series but it wasn't a bad book....	2
9026	A30J6JO7EAQ1HC	When you pay zero or .99 cents for a book and you learn a few things or maybe more, you've got your money's worth if you ask me.	2
9027	A3V809Q7HMD351	After reading the book and it ends the way it did what if I don't get the next one I will never know what happens to Bobby and Ellis .	0
9028	A2EA6B41DVFC7G	I tried my best to like this book, but it was horrible. Just my personal opinion. There may be someone who would enjoy the book but I don't.	1
9029	A1I2GZ0G2KHPL9	This is so short with very little info. Just not worth the read.Just read the other four books and you'll know what you need to know.	0
9030	A27CPEKS03II1C	my teens already knew about these types projects so were not that impressed but i learned some from reading it.	2
9031	A2JFILEGORARSF	This story is short and filled with adult content. It doesn't have a lot of detail. It is a nice quick read.	2
9032	A2YI1HCMXAH9LB	This book was exciting and worth the money.  I really enjoyed the certain battles each character went through and I felt like I was in the action with them.	2
9033	A3P2SXZKU14CBU	Their was nothing I liked about the whole book. I would not recommend to anyone. It was just bad bad	0
9034	ATJLXSAQZA06N	Really enjoyed it. Then the author seemed to be done and just wrapped it all up neatly all at once.	2
9035	ABX2HMQCPJZ2B	I'm all for erotica but this book is on the weird side.  Have to give the book credit...it tells you from the beginning that it is poorly written.	1
9036	APLPQGGK1KUOZ	The chararacters weren't very developed.  The side stiry about the horny robot was the best thing about this story.  I liked it, but I didn't love it.	2
9037	A37FAPA0X8EUWN	A very, very strange book.  All those recipes in between not the most pleasant book reading I have ever done.	1
9038	AVIUO3ED64106	Fairly silly, and the pacing is way too rushed, but I still enjoyed this book quite a bit. It's the perfect light reading.	2
9039	A12K5Y2SEANYW0	this wasn't what could have been done with the story line and plot.a little more would have been a lot better	2
9040	A1ADZRP4U7GROJ	For a short story the plot was good. Its  a good read to pass the time or before going to sleep	2
9041	A3KFQOVEUJZ0VQ	It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. Just a little too cheesy and clich&eacute;.  I'm glad it was free.	2
9042	A3CA2YDIOLMN9Z	Along with other readers it was ok. Quick easy read. Felt like they wouldn't have known each other that well after 24 hours to be doing things from &#34;habit.&#34;	2
9043	A1DC00T32U26HC	This was a very interesting book. Different from other stories. I would have enjoyed it more without the profanity. The characters were all good.	2
9044	APWTCLQGUFAHH	I wish there was more detail in the relationship development between Jo and Mark. It was a cute story though and I liked it.	2
9045	A3KUC6OXV807IA	Not a complete book. Just part of a book and does not have an ending. I'd skip it. Not worth your time.	1
9046	A14M7KACKTA3G9	Great book and I love the preview of the hunt. Guess who will read the book. Definitely positively most likely me.	2
9047	A3MOGV0QO66QZD	It was an ok read, but not long enough.  Not sure I would recommend it to friends to read for enjoyment.	2
9048	A2QRFJHV8CDEOR	No well rounded or written book here. As I was in country during tha same time, I was disapointed with the book	1
9049	A3P0R0B6CWIAQF	Its okay . A very short read to be honest. But i enjoyed it though. Very predictable . And i wish it a bit longer. Good job though	2
9050	A2A701LFVAEMRM	This is a nice little story, but a bit too sweet for my taste.  It is very predictable and no thought is required of the reader.	2
9051	A2KUGJK7GZ3RQ7	Took me less than an hour to read. Should have been free 2.99 was too much.  Sweet little story could have been great.	0
9052	A3FWCXZ2XH6VRA	I thought that this was a good book and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a bug out bag.	2
9053	A257I0FHX9V7JA	Pretty good read. Started out kind of slow. Lots of fighting, fear, blaming themselves and others. Finally learning to grow.	2
9054	A2DMAYH1HSCE5O	This was a very enjoyable read but somewhat predictable...I think maybe Mr Drabble has been overly influenced by Stephen King as some of the scenarios seemed awfully familiar	2
9055	A201O2X5ADB1BI	This book was interesting but didn't have a main character that was very likeable.  Don't think I will read any more in this series	2
9056	A37J1XCFNH6FM4	I like steamy books so long as they have a story to boot! This one had no story and the steam was not even well written.	0
9057	A1PNM2S76RBYNT	A little too gruesome in parts for my taste, but quite suspenseful with an ending I did not see coming.	2
9058	ALX5RNEQ0WKJI	this book has vulgar language and graphic sex. I do not like book that are about violence to people and animals I won't read any of these books	0
9059	A292IB5STRC0DO	Each of these stories had t h e potential to be its own novel..there were too many people to concentrate on any one story. It was very confusing.	1
9060	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	CHRISTMAS is the time we celebrate the birth of Christ.I won't waste my time reading this book.The offensive title truned me off.A Blessed Christmas to all.	0
9061	A39A55WU27A68	Entertaining and a pleasant read. It didn't keep me spellbound, but I did enjoy.  More of a snack type read than a fulfilling meal read.	1
9062	ACVFWFPVI1AAV	I just couldn't get into the story.  I never leave a book without finishing it and have gone back to this one several times but just can't do it.	0
9063	A6ZI6KFAUYFGX	After reading some of the reviews posted, I really expected this to be a lot better.  The sex was the only redeeming quality that had me finish.  So disappointed.	2
9064	A2FTU5RCIXBIZG	A warning would have been nice that this was a porno and not a romance. It was not what I was looking for	0
9065	A44IMNYE70395	Informative first hand review of B58 Hustler operations in the 60's with all its quirks. A great craft for the time.	2
9066	A2PDAT5MVMN326	If you saw the movie 'Wind beneath my wings', you can imagine where this story is going. Sad, sad story.	2
9067	A1Y550BOFFQQ1P	A light refreshing novel with romance and intregue for good measure a definate Stephene Bond classic. Will want more of these easy to read storys.	1
9068	A1UHPEHCJ5ARTV	This story was just ok.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I had to go back to the book to try to remember what it was about in order to rate it.	1
9069	A1MX4I6Q7FH6D6	This book seemed a bit drawn out and took too long to get to the point. I found myseld skipping parts just to get to the point.	1
9070	AIY63PF337QF4	Not a bad book, just not really my cup of tea. Couldn't get involved in the story, maybe it was just a bad day.	2
9071	ABPAWIH1DRCRL	The three storys were well worth the read. But then all of a sudden empty space. Still waiting te see whats next.	2
9072	ASBAWNIGXJ9F1	Not too wild about these books. I really couldn't get into them.They definitely were not my favorite books to read.	0
9073	A3T4VOAQP9D6NR	Slightly reminiscent of cyborg...constant evil chasing and no place to hide. Reasonable plot, but could be developed better and expanded to include an end result to all the drama.	2
9074	AY5WJIS7Y6SJO	I was not really all that impressed. The story was too short, not enough background on the characters. Needs more depth	0
9075	A2HDU31C22PFNI	This book just didn't keep my attention.im sure there was a good story here but it just wasn't for me!	1
9076	AKLEOQGYYBM7Q	Maybe the picture on front of the book should change and there should be a warning that this is about lesbian lovers.	1
9077	AYTMXLYK6SC9H	i didnt like this book very much,it was just ok to me.the cost was ok but ive read better stories from this author	1
9078	A2LS0Z4A6J5TEH	I got the book just to see what it says about the animals. It didn't hold my attention well, but has some good information in it.	2
9079	A2ZG3TLZAJ1SM2	The style was very stilted and the grammar was terrible.  I felt like it was written by a 10 year old. I had no interest in the story line.	1
9080	A3C03V1B9OQPOH	I didn't care for this novella/short story/essay?  It wasn't funny, enlightening, or even very well written.  I expected a short, funny essay.  A total waste of my time.	1
9081	A1O79BLZSTP53I	It was really nice to catch up with the Chase family again. But it was way to short. Left me wanting more. But overall I really did enjoy this.	2
9082	AKK52BR0ZT9SE	This book was not at all what I thought from the review. I did not read more than a chapter and found it not to my liking.	1
9083	A2GF1M3ZUC4NHP	I wasn't a fan.  I didn't find the need to continue buying the next &#34;episodes&#34;. It wasn't my kind of book.	1
9084	AMDEJDMYCTOLY	Not really that interesting. Good thing it was a short story. There was no fleshing out of characters,not much plot.	1
9085	A1PCDLGQHRMX4I	Sure didn't see that coming until the end.  Very clever twist. I enjoy David Baldacci' s novels and look forward to his next book.	2
9086	AJL59IEBNETQ8	Enjoyed the series. Loved the character's. Loved the story. Wanted to know what would happen. Will read more from this author.	2
9087	ALHM275M0FKYP	just a bunch of short stories with not much action and boring thank god I only paid $1 or I would be missed.	0
9088	A3FCGR4W58WQPA	The book was so short. I was just beginning to get into the book and it ended. It left.you hanging so that you would buy the book.	1
9089	A1BZW3BDE8QN7P	Although I was able to see some of what was going to happen there were some unexpected twists.  Good read	2
9090	AZ3WQ5ZS3PAWB	I can't get over how much I did not like this book. Sorry, Will not read more by this author.	0
9091	APGJZ9FWSB6SQ	The pace was fast. The characters believable. I looked forward to reading how they would work things out. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author in this series.	0
9092	A2N0Z577LLP511	A decent storyline but I found it hard to get into. I liked the characters but I found it a bit hard to believe in them.	2
9093	A2D87HWSYKUGXO	Wish the book would have had a little more substance. It was kind of choppy and hard to follow at times. But would like to read the next book.	2
9094	A1NSMDYCBH5ZR9	not worth the 99 cents I paid for it,  very disappointing  NOT a cozy !! I would not recommend this book if you are looking for a cozy murder mystery	0
9095	A19T1A4TS1WHOZ	Well, yes and then again, no. Great narrative on several different life forms on various planets and at different evolutionary stages and cultures. Then ... it's over. Just like that.	2
9096	A2N8SA67TDOL4	I was really looking forward to reading this one but I was a bit disappointed. I still want to read the next one.	2
9097	AXWYVF81NXBAF	I didn't expect the ending but it was a bit cheesy the way Jasmine was taken down.Not sure it that all made sense to me.	2
9098	A1WPQDW5RGAM9S	This could have been written by a teenager. It is simple and choppy. The story line was good but that's all the positive I can say about it.	0
9099	A3SJ6HYBY3VYYW	The storyline was good but neither of the main characters was well formed.  And the constantly changing eye color for them was a distraction.	2
9100	A1AVMV6L6ARGFG	I didn't like this story.  It was like a bad porn movie with indiscriminate sex and no story.  I wouldn't recommend	0
9101	AIG7AOR8Z5D9Z	too short, not relatable enough, too close to a very popular book we've all heard about. i'm glad it was free.	2
9102	A28REJAM6899K8	These little tricks of quickie were something to think about. I don't think a man is ready for something such as this.	2
9103	A1RSJEHTGZBK73	I couldn't get into this book. I really tried. I loved the concept but was bored. I skipped around and enjoyed some of the Dragon lore.	2
9104	AA5FVX2OWISH1	The version I downloaded is in a font that hurts my eyes. I have no idea what the story is like because I can't read it.	0
9105	A3QJY01AFZXROT	Though the book was an enjoyable read, I really felt like it cut off in mid-flow.  Buzz kill for me.	2
9106	A1C6FHU88RNDI5	It was ok. I will, more than likely, read the rest of the series. Of course, I am still looking forward to the rest of the life after war series.	2
9107	A30TZBEYTQK723	This was an ok read for me it didn't knock my socks off but it's worth buying though. The storyline was ok and the character development was there also.	2
9108	AQYEEGNRXM0P1	Sparsely written Gothic Novella.Not much meat to this story.All the usual tropes: brooding hero, wife deceased, young daughter, heroine is a governess, mysterious West wing with eerie sounds and visions..	2
9109	A3PGTGLDAFJ3GF	I did'nt think the characters were believable.  I'm lukewarm on this book. The best part was the ending.  I would'nt read another book in this series.PB	2
9110	AT769S9ZWYH6D	Yet another spoof gone wrong.  So much potential, and they just aren't hitting the mark.  Looking for hilarity, not moronic.	0
9111	A1RVTF261ZMY4M	waste of time. I didn't know what was going on. This story was not written for normal people. I just didn't get it.	1
9112	A1045JJB1OT5ES	When I think of a short story I am thinking of a actual story. However I did not look at the reviews when I bought it. Very disappointed.	0
9113	AY8EWDWLZRY5I	Cute story likable people but ended without a ending so I looked to find next book but nothing. Just not finished	2
9114	A1600Y6IBUD3MT	Not bad...lots of kinky sex, mystery and likeable characters all in a quick read.  I would recommend this book for adults only.	2
9115	AJUPEI2OY5GDM	This &#34;story&#34; felt like it was a chapter taken out of the middle of a book. No character development what-so-ever. It ended at 53%.	1
9116	A30PHXVJI5YZWA	Between the poorly drawn illustrations and the wandering story line I couldn't finish it. The use of the word 'barf' was very over done even for children.	0
9117	AK17GSJ2EQWQV	This book contains some useful information, but it doesn&#8217;t reach much beyond a pep talk to the author&#9472;which might be useful from time to time.	2
9118	A2ME9GVNNFX5HY	I have never watched the Vampire Diaries. I'm not sure if this book is supposed to reflect that series, but I thought it was an enjoable story.	2
9119	A9RV65QZ4A8KA	This would have been a much better book if a picture of each cookie would have been included, either individually or as a group with a key included.	2
9120	A1524Z01N7F336	I hated this book and I could not finish it:(full of beatings and horrible punishments, no happy endingI agree with the other reviewer, buyer beware!	0
9121	ASNO9Y6SQBRUT	I like this book it's not as hot as 50 shades of gray but it's still a good book to read!	2
9122	A2TEWY22GRGKCL	It started off as a fairly good book. So much more could have been done with this story. So much promise, so little work went into it.	2
9123	A1EET132V3FY0V	This was an OK guide.. It's definitely not meant for beginners. I wish this guide had more pictures with step-by-step instructions.	2
9124	ALPOVR1WVPM2Q	Romance was a bit fast and corny but it was fun anyway!Would be more believable had there been a bit more character development.	1
9125	A3LSD2GFZRU6EX	This book was okay it was way to much jumping around from one person to the next somethings u had to draw your own conclusion to..but I enjoy the read	2
9126	A36T4JVDWRHMFY	Way, way too short, a good read for a twelve year old cowboy dreaming pre-teen. Read in less than a half hour.	1
9127	A1Q1INBE7NMOQW	This was a recommended by Amazon read and I got hooked in by the book and had to get the entire series.  Very good story.	2
9128	A1MTZGJDXQJ1I3	I enjoyed this book it was nice just a little long winded. But putting that aside it was a wonderful story.	2
9129	A85LSXS3F2GYC	A nice follow on in this series. A nice little bit of drama to keep things interesting! I just love the men in this series. Can't wait to read more.	2
9130	A33EU1JHKVRTTK	This is a cute short story to read once.  The story was just that.... A story.  Didn't go into the characters, just events that happen on the trip to Venice.	2
9131	A2NDDUWL5RSWUY	This was a cute book. I would recommend it to the kids, especially around Halloween.I hope you enjoy this cute book about zombies.	2
9132	A2M8SRECUGKCEP	I really hate leaving a bad review, especially on a author who I have liked. I made it half through and couldn't finish.	1
9133	A3EBCY4QNAFES4	The female lead was likeable and you wanted her to succeed. The male lead was a nice guy and you wanted them happy together. Overall nice but predictable read.	2
9134	ABJAPVINYMKA1	If you are seeking a quick overview of couponing, this is the place. A few great stores to get you started are discussed as well.	2
9135	A32AUTWA8MM81K	This is a short novella.  This is a fan and celebrity shallow sex infused relationship.  The setting is fun and full of personality.	1
9136	A3JUTTIFPQXJ8K	Mary and Garrett, what a cute couple. I would have loved to of read a longer version of this story.	2
9137	A1VX58I5273EB9	This is more of an educational book about safe sex, how to get tested for aids, and condom usage. It was a really sweet short story.	2
9138	A1AP3DK2U1ONPU	Even though there were a lot of mistakes I still enjoyed the story. It was good story and had all the charm to make you like the characters.	2
9139	AAQILEN2FNL1I	This left me wanting more, yet having to wait is frustrating. The author brings you in, and leaves you hanging.	2
9140	AUDV384VK21RB	This was not at all what I had thought it would be,  Matter of fact, I did not get very far into it before I decided to delete it.	1
9141	AZMMFZKJB8PV6	I read a couple of pages from this book and i lost interest quick, i just could not get into the story because i didnt get the gist of it.	1
9142	A2B31OV6ML11C6	This book had promise but it was so cheesy. I have never read anything by Smith, but it seems that her books are all over the place.	1
9143	A1DZ5U6YLKI2HZ	I liked the characters and the plot.  A good blend of mystery and humor. I would read more books by this author	2
9144	A6AXMHXE0WQJ7	Loved the use of historical references.  Enjoyed the love story built into the story line.  Hope to see more like this book from this writer.	2
9145	A3MPHCT729DE3H	hate is a strong word. i think it deserves one star but i didnt hate it, its just poorly written	0
9146	A360O5UW4AIUYB	While interesting the basic content was rather dry. This book needed more rounding out supplying details. It's worth a look.	2
9147	A16EIV1CS9ZB64	Did not like no story line just same thing over and over. Would not recommend to anyone  just crime story.	1
9148	AFVLB4TT40F2I	Love Susan Mallory! Enjoy all of her books. She is on my list of favorite authors. I read to relax and hers works!	2
9149	A18SHVUTSMK99G	It was like super duper short  I swear . It was over  in like about maybe 3 minutes it was ugh	0
9150	AH10CEIM01N0C	This is definitely a page turner, but I did not like the ending.  I prefer things that aren't science fiction.	2
9151	A3MHNBAOJBPQK7	Is geared towards those in medical fields like dr offices or hospitals.  Some of the stories a layman could understand.	1
9152	A1MLM3TYY9VTS	The sample appears to be very interesting and thought provoking.  It appears to e about the importance of family and a relationship with God.	1
9153	A2ICTRYFO5EA8I	It's always subjective. Some are lame, some hilarious. But among the forgettable are some ones to pass on to the next generation as well.	2
9154	AC7C2EWX2I9EX	Reads like a short story (chapter), rather than a book, but the characters interested me and I kept going back for me.	2
9155	A1VK0IKL1J7I5P	Very Intriguing story. Would have liked to have seen some more backstory to Ren. Maybe some flashbacks throughout the story?	2
9156	AGORW02J2U6ON	so glad this was just 99 cents. Just too unbelievable for me to take seriously....and no plot whatsoever...none.  A complete waste of time.	1
9157	A1HUGHD1EZZBLX	couldn't get pass the first chapter it was s bad, it was so bad that I just didn't want to waste my time reading amymore.	0
9158	A3AHUQDRYTVYWH	this was a mistaken purchase, I read part of it and couldn't read the rest, I didn't like it but some one else might.	1
9159	A2YTZCXVGQDI7M	Why should erotica be so crappy?  Don't waste your time; this is kind of boring - there wasn't much in the way of real kink.	0
9160	A3C713428J4MJ7	I think this story was just okay.there was not a lot going on with this story.that is why it is just okay.	2
9161	A2RFID3EKKBWK5	Not a big fan of the older guy/younger guy dynamic, but the characters' situations, needs and resolutions worked for me and I wound up liking it.	2
9162	A332F4S44LYK26	No new ground covered, no new insights captured, but I smiled as I read the familiar anecdotes. A bon-Bon, not a substantial bite	2
9163	A1LHMH0AFUSS77	Definitly the type of book for me.  I love stories of the Amish, the way they live.  I canlive right along with them.	2
9164	A1VEHVRAP4RNX4	This was a very good read.A believable book. NOT A LOT OF WILD SEX,THE NAVY SEAL WAS PRETTY ' REAL	2
9165	A3ARKK4TBOJR4T	I was very disappointed when I found the last pages to be .......not the last! The story continued but in a different book?	0
9166	ADGR3XB512CM1	Not the right cord, but I can use it for other things.  Not the right cord, but I can use it for other things.	2
9167	A3845G5NW1T2WB	It builds and then there is no real resolution. She escapes but what of the man that held her? What happens to her? Not a good ending.	2
9168	A1PYPC0SGTL8PV	This was not even worth reading or waiting time for. No story to it. Didn't make any sense either way	0
9169	A1TYECW2J3TXJ	This is a new author for me. This was short and sweet !! This was a time travel story!!  Enjoy !!!	2
9170	A3AB13H23M4GNU	decent but i would rather it be less serious.	2
9171	AO9MHN8E6IWBW	This book was pretty farfetched. I could not really get into it, it was hard to believe anything about the plot. I would not recommend it to anyone for entertainment.	1
9172	AYZ0UEAG98RG5	"As said above, I am a realist reader, but Zeltserman""s stories were different and believable. I would read him again."	2
9173	A18E9XYWF7XAKZ	The rhyming was good to read and I like the recipe at the end of the book. The illustrations were O.K. but I don't like these type of pictures.	2
9174	A3LYMG98UR1R01	Old, outdated and idiotic. 101 jokes and I laughed once!! It was a waste of my time reading them. Don't bother.	0
9175	A3IXR7QBV0TW1X	It was just okay. Too much detail,but I would  probably recommend this book to one of my friends.They may like it.	2
9176	A186O7HITQL5Z1	I read six chapters before I began to like this book. It's very boring in the beginningAnd  began to just flip through several  chapters before it finally got my attention.	0
9177	AXWYZ61LUMB9P	This was a poorly written story.  It read as if it was written by a teenager for teenagers.  Do not waste your time.	0
9178	A1QVRO7FNATJKX	It's one thing to have similar stories but this  was so basic, and overdone.  It was a huge let down.	0
9179	A2PGF8GB1MTCYW	It was a light read, you knew what was going to happen but sweet. It was like a typical Mills and Boom	2
9180	A3B9YVPW42GS5Q	For a short story, it really had no plot and didn't go anywhere.  I was disappointed.  It could have been so much more.	2
9181	A2LOFKSMWZ05O1	The description had me and I couldn't wait to read this book, but I was disappointed that the story didn't have more depth.	2
9182	A1IMRQN25R166H	The story wasn't too bad, but the grammar and use of the English language was horrible. I think the author is either a pre-teenager or not a native English speaker.	0
9183	A3TE038NLTPLYT	This book started out so slow to catch my interests..It took along time to finish it..Not so great..Very boring for me..	2
9184	A293W2MU6STRGP	The pink rose  was an interesting book.  But I  found it had much too much sexual detail for my liking.  The details left  no time for imagination.	1
9185	A1S6NK3RPU82KG	DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A HOMESEXUAL BOOK TILL ABOUT THE 10 PAGE AND THEN i DELETED IT SORRY JUST NOT FOR ME	0
9186	A1TG4N58ZJPNA3	The way the printing shows up on the Kindle makes it hardto read.  These poems are better read in a book.	1
9187	A32AUTWA8MM81K	A very open story.  The characters have their family drama.  There is a lot of talk of how to resolve.  The romance is sweet and clean.	2
9188	A3A70BBKSE8V9N	Not many tips i didn't already know. Not worth the price. You can look up many of these tips online.	2
9189	A2FV518RI34QIT	A nice read but nothing spectacular.	2
9190	A37YY6BALSBA6C	A somewhat enjoyable story but not overly exciting.  Very predictable ending, if you have a rainy afternoon, would make a good filler.	2
9191	A2MST2Y3I5CCPR	Not the best I've read but the characters were likeable and the story was pretty good a little predictable but good will read Jacqui rose again	2
9192	A3TC60MGLW1I76	I'm not really in to reading supernatural books but I have to say that this book was entertaining. There is sexually explicit content but the book is well written.	2
9193	A19N301CQ8IWW9	A little overboard for my taste but a decent message I suppose.  I thought it was too sappy and the author certainly wasn't whispering about God.	1
9194	A3UV17865R9NUF	I liked it. Good read. Short but fun. Female character strong and realistic. Can not wait to read next one.	2
9195	A3HRO0PRVEN7S	Cute photos of 35 dogs who were adopted and a brief history of each one.. Enjoyable  for dog lovers of all ages.	2
9196	AY81IS1PW4K4U	This book was truly a fiction  There was no factual research.  Totally unbelievable.  I was extremely disappointed...the good news was it was short and free.  Sometimes free is too much	0
9197	AHRYGZ88RPTI6	This was more into a cooking theme for this novel.  It was a little slow and had a very abrupt ending.	2
9198	A1CFSKLMY1S42D	It was a well written story, but did not have time to get to know the characters in depth. Would have liked more development of the characters.	2
9199	A23388S9BYK0F1	It was an okay book, not anything to talk about kind of corny in some ways I would not recommend	2
9200	AZY0ZLZHJYTSE	Brianna is not what she seems its a ok mystery alot of turns in it i didnt exspect but still a good read	2
9201	A3KR3N21N470FU	For a Free book, it was an okay read, nothing to keep your interest.  The hero was so insecure and cruel its a wonder that the heroine didn't leave him.	2
9202	A1ZB0W4XJGSRLH	Just a very strange book with no real conclusion. I guess the idea is that it leads to another book, but it does not actually indicate that at the end.	1
9203	A1LY6L0HICCLC1	Sweet and short but not my cup of tea.  I think it is more the style of book rather than the authors content.	2
9204	A1CTXFV36Y7P7Y	Couldn't get into it. I finished it grudgingly. If you're in the market for an easy read with some hot and heavy petting, look no further.	1
9205	A2F1FWEH5ZLZ3	I didn't finish reading this book. It has a weak story line, and just didn't make me want to keep reading it.	1
9206	AV76UEGYMLFDS	I did not like this book at all it is fun and cruel don't get this book it's time is up	0
9207	AFV82CSN2N1D4	I have read other stories from this author and enjoyed them. I read this book but it is not very memorable can't remember the story line	2
9208	A1Q5EBGVAKXH6R	Seems like a whiole book committed to one event, is kind of cumbersome. Not very good characters, and foulnd not really caring of they defeated the big bad monster.	2
9209	AS09YZV00HGLO	It was a pretty good book, just not long enough. I felt it was rushed. It has a/ lot of potential.	2
9210	A7WRG6XQXUKRZ	really liked it, writing was good, suspence as usualy au rendez-vous and the whole story is fantastic. really appreicate it.	2
9211	A3KSONYD4SXCGJ	Not only is the spelling and grammar horrendous but parts of sentences are missing and the word order of sentences is incorrect.	1
9212	A1C3W49V0TKU35	Too juvenile for my taste. Teasing you means I love you. I enjoy a good romantic comedy movie, but not with my books.	1
9213	A1W74BG6KAHNFH	I thought this was going to be like another book that was written by the same author but this one wasn't as good.  I would not repurchase this book.	0
9214	A3RRL3MZAN0VQ4	The first book of the trilogy took a loooooong time to get to the point.  Overall, it held my attention, but it's not the best I've ever read.	2
9215	A2FWXQODZU0BFW	I didn't finish this book, I will pick it up later. I like fantasy books that envolve good dragons dragons	2
9216	AD6ROXTU7305R	Not sure what that title meant but the book was pretty good, I thought it needed some more work on it and it would have been great.	2
9217	A24AE9S4FLDA5H	I'm glad this book was free. It was a love story but very short. I just started to get into it and it was over.	1
9218	A3SQD3Y7EPYEUQ	it was a pretty good book not the best I've read but still good. I plan on reading more from this author	2
9219	ADGBQA6JMY0YB	Would have been nice to know I was reading gay porn. The story was ok but I had to skip over the man on man sex.	0
9220	A3LSU280L9V5S5	Boring to say the least...nothing spectacular about this story at all, ..was quite disappointed, dull boring waste of my time..sucked	1
9221	A3UBUHSX0LZG6O	This story had great potential but felt rushed. I know it was only .99 but to me it felt like it was missing a lot.	1
9222	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	There are so many better books out there. Do not waste your time on this one. Skip it, you wll regret reading it.	0
9223	AZB7MAHDCCHMW	A rather clerical  overview of Seal organization history and evolution but not enough meat to make an interesting or memorable story.	2
9224	A3P2SXZKU14CBU	This one was. Ot as bad as love I the doff one and two  would not recommend to others to read	1
9225	AX82GOLO85X21	Twelve kisses later was such a sweet story. It was a fast book and I read it all in one setting in between novels.	2
9226	AGUN991S7ALTP	It was ok, I've  read better from this author but it was ok. Looking for the next part.. hope it's better though	2
9227	A3DV2Y0GQCKNTJ	I bought this book after having read 'Bared to you' which was fantastic (although a 'shade of grey').This book has great sex scenes but the story is weak.	1
9228	A2JD13PAIYPS33	I thought I was getting a book. It was only 4 chapters as a tease to buy the rest of the story...in 5 books! I feel cheated!	1
9229	A1HG2YB6T4HA7W	Not much here.  A simple Internet search would have given the reader this bit of sparse information.  I don't recommend this book.	0
9230	A19G4MRJ85G16V	Pretty good other than it being way too short. I finished in about 15 minutes.. oh well I guess. Time to look for a better book.	2
9231	A2UFJC04MZTQAX	Short story. Too short!!! Nothing dynamic. Cute is all that can be said about it!!!!Waste of time !!!! oh	1
9232	AMXZEX5LOKDY6	I don't know what's going on and who the people are..there are no background to any of the characters ..thank God it was free	0
9233	A13351DSHQAIT7	Fantasy story that's really all about the car that's being promoted in this piece. Not worth it, even if free.	0
9234	AOU97P0ADN0GX	A great read, but as a spanking story, it lacks any description and reactions of the characters involved in the spankings.	2
9235	AMA0NEOXU7PSB	This isn't such a great thing to say Ik but I hated your book.  It was too boring I HATE BORING	0
9236	A3361XGKYF17S3	I wasn't really it this book. Seem to me like it dragged on. Not really much action in this book.	2
9237	A3PYD6NRANH2VN	Very easy reading.  Great when you need to relax or just to pass the time. I am curious about the next one.	2
9238	A1WKFQYYRJ95F6	Not very useful. I had expected something more thorough and with much more information. It's very basic and biased. Not for you if you're not a Christian.	1
9239	ARY023MVOJW8C	It was a very short story but keep your interest.  I need to write 10 more words so I can submit	2
9240	AT1FQ3R1EXO0Y	How many times can you make the same 3 points?  How many times can you make the same 3 points?  How many times can you make the same 3 points?	0
9241	AJHRNR3AZ4RAB	It's not too bad I just think it needed more n the character of the beating husband turns my off although it's real in this age n time	1
9242	A31K93JWWNEMAJ	It was an ok read, I dont have much to say it just didnt keep me as intrested as I usual like to be.	2
9243	A1TGSSYT00RWS6	The Manual helped a little but still did not answer all of my questions, and have had to go on line to Amazon to get answers.	2
9244	AFLHSS3286LLV	Very short with only so-so rhymes. The photos were cute but much smaller and less engrossing than the usual baby night time books.	2
9245	A2IMMJHL8J9X3F	Plot ta good.  Characters are strong and the relationships arePromising but that is the rub.  The ending does not tie up.	2
9246	AXM4GIH8F0KAY	Better story telling in this installment. Less rehashing of setup information on the characters unlike the previous books.  More enjoyable read.	2
9247	A3UH0QDGZ1VYX6	Found this to be very basic. Good for beginners, but not real detailed for me. You may like it tho.	1
9248	A2N6RAN12HGIJ6	This book is pretty good I just wish there was a little bit more to the story line...maybe some more drama or suspense...something	2
9249	A2JDL705PWSEOJ	this was OK.  It just did not keep me wanting to read this as my other books did.  Did not have enough action or romance for me.	2
9250	A372SLAISSEUXR	This book is crazy but hey thats y i brought i love Fallon books and this was a good conclusion to book 1 so i  recommend it to everyone	2
9251	A5DPAEJSGFE3	The book was better than I thought. Quite an enjoyable read. Could have been a little longer, but all in all nice book.	2
9252	AQVGSI84SR40K	Slow paced, not well written.  It does have a decent story line, like I said, just very slow paced.  Decent, but not exciting.	2
9253	A3H7J5POTR9TZW	This is the 8th Lee Child book I read. It was a nice book to read because it is a story about Jack & family.	2
9254	A375E8PGFFF135	I have enjoyed other titles from LB Gregg and thought this one had a good premise.  However it was only okay.	2
9255	A20EIO8ZPG3ISM	They are okay, I've read other books that I've liked better but it was okay reading when I needed to escape.	2
9256	A2E49RV3LB8IA8	Good book if you into transgender stories, which I am not, but is good enough to get you to read it all the way to the end	2
9257	A3RC9RHMXKWTRR	Interesting short story. Simple and to the point. Excellent writing. Would have  been interesting as a 2-3 chapter series or shirt series.	2
9258	A22GGHISKRVAOX	I usually enjoy neither third-person novels nor mystery literature, so naturally this book didn't sit well with me, and I wouldn't recommend it.	2
9259	A5I8B43YGGKN	This book is a very short read.  It had a story line but I'm just not sure if I believed it. See what you think...	2
9260	A1X3VG6F1DEEBE	These books are a very short read. Only slightly entertaining. Glad they were cheap and I didn't waste too much money on them.	2
9261	A1GYBQO81BUU0	I wasn't real happy with this story , It didn't keep me interested in the story.	1
9262	A1UMBGPYHTUBCT	Waste of time.  Not worth free.  Short story with no point.  Garbage. Nothing else to add...just reread what I wrote. Done.	0
9263	A3AT77JPKOR67M	Yes, lots of sex, but that is the style of this particular genre. She's an erotic writer. That being said, it was good.	2
9264	A39GA6RNJOFP53	I tried three times to fight my way thru this book and failed three times.Its just a rehash of an old story told in a boring way.	0
9265	A2NLS0AC6HT65P	The inconsistency with the story made this boom less than steller...at one point I almost stopped reading but I carried on. Get a good editor and tighten up the storyline.	1
9266	A3SNQ4WX0BZT9Q	How can this sister have NO redeeming qualities. It reduces the whole work when a character is so one dimensional in a completely cliche way.	2
9267	A1J1K8QRC5YPYU	Too short. Too rushed bit left me wanting more.  Nice for a quick read but don't expect too much from it.	1
9268	A29LO6HGCXCJR7	I felt like I was dropped in the middle of a story, unaware of it's beginning and left hanging at the ended.	2
9269	A1661VU1XJ9RL6	Way to cheesy and predictable. I really didn't like it. Good thing it was so short so I just finished it and deleted it.	0
9270	AKM1G7U37J5YD	I would like to see the series using COMPLETED books at each stage. I read them all, and still felt like I was waiting for the punch line.	2
9271	A38Z6XC4VB3XOC	This book was like one of those Christmas letters you get from acquaintances that go on and on, telling you boring things about people you don't know.	0
9272	A3OGSXZ69GKY2S	I'm waiting for the girls to ruin this like the Briarcreek Series and you could tell that it is about to happen!	2
9273	AM0ILEFHDGQEW	Didn't like that it was British. Some parts were confusing. There were Some good action scenes. Glad to finish it.	1
9274	A3SQD3Y7EPYEUQ	it's a good book just moved to fast and the story was way to short. I think if it was longer it would've been better	1
9275	A1ROMOZ4BR4UWC	Probably a good book for a lot of people - just not for me. I could not get into it. Well written - just did not appeal to me.	2
9276	A326HRPBNJ6N58	mostly...  who really cares? there is nothing to hook you in and the sex is predictable and who cares at all? not me.	0
9277	A4JZOZEZ8NLUA	If you are having trouble sleeping this will put you right out. I enjoy fantasy and scifi but this was as boring at 35 as it was at 15	2
9278	AMD7163PDVVWH	Liked this book..  Need to locate more by her...shot book but one of interest. I think you will be impressed.  For all ages..	2
9279	A30K9MEPFESK61	I enjoyed reading this book once but it is not one that I will read again.	2
9280	A1SJORWVYZ2Q7E	really short, poorly written. nothing about it held my interest. I like ghost stories, I know they are just stories but at least try to make them believable.	1
9281	A2S24E19ZMLUH9	This would have been a halfway decent mystery except for the gratuitous sex that did nothing to advance the plot and read like it was some sophomoric how-to manual.	0
9282	A3ELGEQOF1B1SV	It was a good read , too short for my liking. I like meatier books a little more characters and story.	1
9283	A1E30B7EZCBW8F	This one was missing something for me. Still good but not quite as hot as the others. It needed more background maybe or more follow up.	2
9284	AZM5ZE0QH4MCL	A decent story but you could pretty much see what was coming around the bend. However there were a few surprise.	2
9285	A3OC8ZG1S3OAVA	I thought this was pretty good for a short story.  A great twist at the end.	2
9286	A330Z8D2HEXC07	I wished it had been longer so it could've explained the entire story in full. Other than that I enjoyed it.	2
9287	A2TFG8O90BLX86	It was too short good story but it would have nice if the conflict was a little longer and the character development wasn't so one dimensional.	2
9288	A53DUDASGBTSB	"This book was an okay read. I liked the graphics, but I did not care for some of the rhyming. It didn't seem to ""click."""	2
9289	A2HPAI1FOYRPVM	This is a very good story and has potential for a sequel. Unfortunately the end is rushed and seems unfinished.	2
9290	A2HF3I2XROKXO7	Nope did not like it, had to stop it, sort of a jumbled mess and direction was lacking.  Save your money buy something else	0
9291	A1I3CP8FQTLR8	The story concept was very interesting but I didn't really enjoy how it was written out our how it ended.	2
9292	A2Q5WE1MY3E1QX	Just not my thing I guess.  Figured it would be humorous since its a Romantic Comedy.  It wasn't. Enough said.	1
9293	A3KN51ST80ZDK5	This book was good. There's a LOT of bad grammar in the book as if they didn't proof read before they published. Other than that this was a good read.	2
9294	AG078KHF94Y9O	The app marketing book was okay. I did not find it super helpful it was interesting enough but that was all	2
9295	A12K5Y2SEANYW0	A decent little story that could have been so much more. If this is the first of a series, it could be good.	2
9296	A2QS4K57RVXVY0	No surprises here.	1
9297	AQRVJTGF5SBAN	Never did really figure out what the dog training system that never fails is....beyond the advice to do whatever works with the dog and not be tied to one method.	1
9298	A3A8N9ULMNW2JD	I would give Sing 3.5 stars. It was interesting to see a vulnerable side of Jonathon, and to see where it all began.	2
9299	A1PSWIQWD65AH	Wasn't my favorite, but it was a pretty good storyline and moved along at a good pace with pretty good characters.	2
9300	A2SKYZX7N2ULW7	I bought this one because I thought there where 4 books to read, but they where only short bits. So I was happy with them, at all.	0
9301	AEVLOW8J74E6Z	I found the characters very agreeable, if not overly forgiving. !0 years of pain sure seemed to be nothng as they slipped back into thier old rolls.	2
9302	A36JELIH955MWD	nothing to really say it didn't hold me and i deleted it after reading only skimmed it to the end as i wasn't interested in it enough	0
9303	AK6QV6O8CR00X	Got to chapter 5,  asked Amazon for refund, they did, off my device.  One dimensional, amateur, predictable, simplistic (trying to get to 20 necessary words).	0
9304	A1FNHN3016JHAV	This is a young reader series but is written with enough style that it entertains adults as well, this series s my go to for quick relaxing read.	2
9305	APE86CFD0GSKO	Can't actually remember too much about it - but that could be a reflection on either the story or the fact I read too much.	2
9306	A15H8H0ZE3D28D	I had difficulty getting into this book and found it a little tedious.  Maybe it was just the subject matter which I didn't find interesting.	1
9307	A23IKBWSIS1HN6	THIS IS NOT A BOOKIt states that it is an exclusive extract from the new Jack Reacher book A W......M....Not at all what I wanted	0
9308	A38XHZUHU5Q0RO	It had some good parts, but it wasn't that great. The sex was hot but I felt like it was missing something.	1
9309	A22OK30ANU9DSX	This book is written well, kind of gross in some parts. Would've liked it to be a longer story as it was holding my interest.	2
9310	A15VDUFBGBTAUG	Holds your attention. An entertaining book for those who want adventure and action without in-depth character development. A quick, easy novel for entertainment only.	2
9311	AOD77D495QEL	This was a fun little story. It was a quick and easy read, and I enjoyed getting to know the characters.	2
9312	A2I5587X1VE4KC	What's sooo bad about this book, it didn't leave a lasting impression. I can't remember reading it. Could be it sucked soo bad, that I fell asleep reading it.	1
9313	A2K2TAFWGKDUQV	Two short tales, not bad, but not really worth purchasing.The stories are more for the late teen type readers.	2
9314	ABVXY3D3CCY1Q	it was ok, cute quick read. it was free and i tried it, and didn't mind it. not one to reread though	2
9315	A2VP2ZVE914QNI	Too short and too boring, not worth the effort to  read.  Just not good western fiction or else just very poorly written.	1
9316	A3CQP2ACRFW6E7	lack of romance between the two mates.lack of details of the love story.Will be better after review .	2
9317	A12DPYU3BD46QX	Typical Alpha meets repressed human female, all the while fighting the attraction. This type of protagonist was a new twist, but the story was barely exciting.	0
9318	A2OBZW6JIRROX6	I needed more information the story was too short and didn't end for me!  Wish we could have found out what happened to Lila and Lincoln at college.	2
9319	AGT71H7265SYZ	It is a book that you can see what's coming. Not overly exciting, but has the potential with a few more twists to it.	0
9320	AQ3QKY99SGMS5	This was a little short for me, I usually read the longer stories.  It was a good, sweet clean story though.	2
9321	A2PAFNZ5D4J4WN	I chose this rating because it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I prefer a faster moving story line.  It just wasn't what I thought it would be.	2
9322	A3HD42O6BBOOZR	The characters draw you into the stories; These books kept me intrigued they were just a little short and rushed at the end. But, I would recommend these books!	2
9323	A2HS7K379UG0G5	i am not a real big fan of this regency stuff - her westerns series are much much better. i hope to read another one of those soon	2
9324	A1RGO1TKO8YFZZ	Not much in here I would eat that I couldn't figure out myself. I'm glad it was free because I would have hated to waste money on it.	1
9325	A3FKII244W4121	Enjoyable read nithing to over the top and mostly predictable  would recomend for the sheerlove of reading a little action romance	2
9326	A3HD1T2IKS0DD6	the plot and characters were good. i just couldn't take the bad dialog and writing. i really tried but gave up at about half way.	0
9327	A3W6IYKH31V5N	Stilted language...editing mistakes....implausible story.....could not finish it....glad it was only 99 cents....but still not worth it even at that price	1
9328	A3801AFH5JO56U	It Was an ok book. Just to simple. I guess you get what you get when the book is free.	1
9329	A3SRV8MBZ6RX33	Strangely amusing.Fun read. Light romance and mystery. Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word Word.	2
9330	A14KB9BUV2S51Y	Jesse & his crew are always in trouble but Ron Francis knows how to work them out. A good read.	2
9331	A1I4NFFM9HCIXB	I enjoyed this book ,it was a page turner was a bit confusing at times but it all came together .THE ENDING  I DIDNt see if coming	2
9332	A2TZ0KGY62RPW5	I can't say that I understood the point of this book. I laughed at a few parts, but most left me wondering.	1
9333	A15R58K0ID46A1	I did not like this much as I think it will be good for kids but not so much for the adults	0
9334	A2SKVHG4PKH6E3	Decent story but way too short. Feels like i paid too much for too little. The series idea is great if the author would add too it.	2
9335	AJL59IEBNETQ8	Enjoyed the story. Finished it in a day. Will read more form this author. Was a nice short story to read in a day.	1
9336	APMBZLAH0DEF4	This was an o.k. Book for me. I felt like the older couples stood out more than the main characters. There betting pool really entertained me.	2
9337	A20R37WRPLUM1D	Decent character development for such a short story. An interesting story, enough so that one might wish it were longer.	2
9338	A1X3VG6F1DEEBE	Only kept reading this series because i started it and bought the entire series at once and didn't want to waste my money!!!	2
9339	A3NKKVAKGBWXED	I liked the two stories I read but when I ordered it I thought it was still length NOVEL I perfer a story that goes into more detail.	1
9340	A1NEKXTNOE0A6F	Very good reads another good book from HT Night a must read set if u like Mr Night then you must get these too and read	0
9341	ATLU40CZ1REEB	The novel was not engaging. The characters were uni dimensional. While the plot was intriguing, the book failed to live up to its potential.	1
9342	A3NH5A8FH4Z3KZ	A typical Jack Reacher story. The novel was transmitted well and in a brief period. THe Kindle received and played it well.	2
9343	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	I liked the story and the characters but not sure that the high price tag was worth the money I spent.	2
9344	AG1KFY7PDZ9IG	This story was a little light in some areas, but very powerful in others. Josie is an amazingly mature 18-year-old.	2
9345	A2R1TNO2KV5EUV	I'm not into magic or the paranormal, but the love story was interesting to read.  If books 2 & 3 become available for free download, I'd read them.	2
9346	A1FSR426FVMQJI	I enjoyed the wicked twist in the fairy tales we all grew up reading.If you want a different take on the old tales read this.	2
9347	ACTQSIPO87BX4	I just love ALL of Celia Kyles' books and try to read the all if I can get my hands on them.	2
9348	A35W08TU10YPCI	Would read again and that's saying some thing. I don't usually reread books but I will now. Would recommend to my friends and family.	2
9349	APJ2CJGJRLJNU	This book is a waste of time and money. The writing is terrible. I didn't get past the first few pages. Maybe it gets better but I'm doubtful	0
9350	AIDQNO0FXMY3F	Absolutley no plot.  and I abhore the filthy sex scenes.  That a true romance could develop in three days is ridiculous.I would not recommend it to anyone.	0
9351	A2LHN1WR9PYA8D	Of course, as the author states, it is always best to choose kindness.  Actions speak much louder than our words.	2
9352	AVO7BODO8D51G	Action and plot twists are contrived and unrealistic.  Characters are fairly developed and the local color accurate.  Several editing errors.	2
9353	AESU2YOOHC6DN	Eaten by panthers! Really?!? The stupidity in the designs the author says were used in the arks are beyond the pale!	0
9354	A3AWZ258YQURW9	Poorly constructed, stupid plot, no depth. A total waste of time and effort. Didn't waste my time finishing this 'story'.	0
9355	A10OPG5TRB155S	It was a good shirt easy read. One of those that could be drawn out more, more detail but overall not bad.	2
9356	A17K95SEU3J68U	This is a fun, lighthearted spoof on the old Sherlock Holmes stories. Highly improbable story but leaves the door open for the &#34;diamond&#34; to be in Sherlock's posession.	2
9357	A314SBQZWR9CU7	It was interesting to read the first Mad magazine. I wish it had been as funny as the ones I remember but they had to start somewhere.	2
9358	A35F9N4FBQESWU	It was okay kinda confusing maybe part 2 will be better! I really wanted this to be a banger! And it could,ve been but it seemed rushed!	2
9359	A3JRULGWDYX8R7	It is a good read if you read Along Came Trouble.  Very much to the point, not a sexy book, but it does make you feel good.	2
9360	A34W8F8G10GPGP	I sent this back because it did not fit my plain old Kindle. i am sure if I had the right kindle I would of loved it.	2
9361	A2T5JIW0F46ERR	THE PREVIEW PAGES KEPT M E READING THE BOOK,BUT WHEN I FINALLY GOT THE BOOK,IT WAS SOOO HARD 2 FOLLOW AND SOOOO CONFUSING	2
9362	AI206T5L1QM7X	Not a very challenging story to read or understand, very predictable and way too much descriptive used in creating a minds eye picture.  Try Baby Blue by Lloyd Albritton.....	1
9363	A38ZC7NCQG1A14	Dislike. Started off slow and the finish was predictable and such a cliche. Won't be buying another Iris Blaire novel....	1
9364	A35C7G6YUY6AHL	Was hard to get into the story. Had to will myself to persist. It did get better toward the end, which leaves some hope for pursuing the series.	2
9365	A18O0N0QI055FU	This book was just okay to me but as I read the next books, I was glad I continued. The story is fun.	2
9366	AQZ64R6S3R1VF	This was a good story. It's one of those books you read to kill time with. They're not great stories but they are terribly bad either.	2
9367	A343TT364JKNO5	I thought this book was a little immature, and seemed obvious the author lacked experience in what she was writting about...seemed more like a young innocent girls fantasy	2
9368	A3H1BG2GPDBIAI	to much blood and guts for me.  Maybe someday when I am really bored I will finish this set.  But not anytime soon,	2
9369	A3D6MU90FZN7OH	This book is written like a student's bad book report.  I could not finish reading past the first few chapters.	0
9370	APHRI6QXZ9Y0P	This book bothered me for some reason that I only got to the second chapter. It might be good for younger people though.	0
9371	AN3SSTS24R3EJ	Not much of a story on it's own. No plot. Just pure sex between two strangers who are attracted to each other physically and remain strangers through the ending.	1
9372	AJDAPSUP5XA7T	Started to read this, but could not finish it. Poorly written. I felt like I was reading a third grade story book.	0
9373	ANVNA26W2QVB7	Not enough character development. Story line fell short.  1 star was too generous. Hopefully better luck on authors next literary piece.	0
9374	A3IYSUC24PLTMU	A good read. However, it could have been much more longer  if  just a little more try. This was like a novella.	2
9375	A18QNVLD9L8Z5F	but was okay.plot was too predictable and the use of all the quotes from plays was somewhat lost on me.	2
9376	A3VDYCJQOY7RHC	This novel was little difficult for me to read because I could not pronounce the Hawaiian names of individuals and streets.	2
9377	AHLHK7Q1N5KK3	I LIKED THE STORY VERY MUCH.  THE ONLY THING IT WAS TOO SHORT AND I FELT BECAUSE OF THAT IT WAS RUSHED.	2
9378	A3A3S81YP2V752	I tried to get into the stories, but it just hasn't happened for me.  Maybe its just not my type of apocalyptic novels. great price though.	1
9379	ADK827JF6CKJ0	This could have been better.  The story was interesting but it felt rushed and sometimes the action was poorly described.	2
9380	A2EY6LPAQGYLAS	This was an interesting book. I didn't love it, I didn't hate it. It was an easy read and it did keep me interested.	2
9381	A1R1DQ2N77TOHO	It was a cute story towards the end. It was a short story about the death of a man who ate fruitcake.	1
9382	A1HANHG5F7Z5UR	"I just couldn't get into this one. Too much back and forth and it just didn't hold my attention.. ""I want her but I can't have her."""	2
9383	A21K9CF22PAGL5	SORRY BUT I DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS BOOK.  I ONLY MADE IT THROUGH THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS.  SO IT JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR ME.	1
9384	A1IGEOFJ6DZQ69	...predictable plot. Man saves lady saves man. Straight regency romance. But lovely writing. Surprising humor.  A perfectly delightful summer read!	2
9385	A2Y1X56N8NPH8G	This was perhaps the most surreal little story with absolutely NO set up that I have ever encountered.  Truly surreal and silly.	1
9386	A2RO2N7G5DVQNQ	I confess I never made it through all the books.  Day or night it was just too creepy.  If you enjoy being really scared, read it.	2
9387	A26JR6PBN8FCJ1	This book was ok. Not sure that I will read another one from this author. I did not think the sex scenes were hot :(	2
9388	A1L6EMVO8SNSED	Of all the books I've read in this genre I really believe this series may be the worst or second to it. It has no real direction, just dark	0
9389	A17CSEU50DXJQQ	This one was just OK for me.  I found the thought of humans being served up for food a little hard to read about.	2
9390	A23EC7LPLUM6J5	A humorous look at holiday overeating and boozing, what to purchase the wife for Christmas, the dangers of decorating, etc.  It was okay.	1
9391	A10K4CN7CEA3K0	this was a draining story..she lived in lala land..a little to much for me.  I a good read but just a little &#34;really&#34; for me	2
9392	A21U6T9JELRL2A	Not really worth the trouble and the stories were not very believable. I found myself saying , WTH! Would not get a second installment by this author	1
9393	A3QLMOH8UIPL74	For me this book just needed more. I felt like the story was lacking and I dint really care for the characters either	1
9394	A1LTW1Y592F8I8	I have never finished this book. Had a hard time getting into it. But will re-look at it on my next air flight	2
9395	A3LXK4EET2XJBF	Very sad but also a mystery to what is going to happen fun and good book to read at times	2
9396	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	As long as you dont have to pay for this, then it isn't bad. I read this book during my luch break.	2
9397	APBYW9BSH3S3I	Not bad. Kept my attention.  Great suspense, and even greater love scenes. Quick read. Really enjoyed the ending. Hope there's a book 2!	2
9398	A1PPEVKPZIXH5T	Nothing exciting, but a nice read.  I enjoyed it.  A short but pleasant story.  I will order the next in the series also.	2
9399	A32UDZXVDJ2DA5	I think it would have been a pretty good book, if it had just been longer.  The Amish stories are always cute.	2
9400	AZD74VERJY2LP	It was an okay book to read I wasn't really into it I was expecting more or I guess I didn't feel the chemistry	2
9401	A3B13O4HOO1BJR	This was a one night stand story, extremely short. It was colorful but yet short but that's what happens on a one night stand	2
9402	A1PFNZMUFPZ1TN	I chose this rating due to the sexual descriptions.  The story is very good.  I just don't like all the other.	2
9403	A3B7ZCTW9G9T0S	I like a book to complete the story and not leave you hanging and required to buy another one to see what happens.	2
9404	A1CUP22DUKKCKJ	It was okay.I have read better from her.I was hoping something would happen to the good for Emmaline.Didn't like the new guy from the start.	2
9405	A1U7ZTYL9Q2CLS	This story was well written for the most part but it seemed rushed to a premature conclusion.  It could have been so much more fully developed. I wanted more.	1
9406	AW7SM5XG88UEO	So many secrets lurking in the hearts of these British folk.  So many suspects, so many motives...made this fascinating and mildly mysterious.	2
9407	A8DH1DNFGUS72	the guy was an ass. the girl did not deserve the abuse  would have never bought it due to bdsm.	1
9408	A15S5TDV6H5HDX	I thought the story was good, but I felt that the book was quite short and the story ended abruptly.	2
9409	A1MXSVPHCTNPRT	Some nice basics.  Even some case histories.	2
9410	A3UQX3ZZERLOAJ	Not a favorite but not bad either. It didn't keep my attention like some books do but I would try another of Kathy Dunnehoff's books.	2
9411	AYRXW50YBYYJA	Found the story fairly aortic.  Had some good parts, but it was little long. Few misplaced words plus some parts went over the top but wasn't disappointed	2
9412	AA5ABROFP9AZ	Well it was not bad but wish it wasn't a short going to have to get the rest it definitely got my interest	2
9413	A20R37WRPLUM1D	Short, but OK romance. A once young long love that fell apart and manages to reform years alter. A bit of drama, sex, and good feelings.	2
9414	A10WE4JQOHF6H2	I just find that for this type of book, I think I'd rather have a hard copy to I could mark things to come back to.	2
9415	ALTZKO00IA4EB	I have to give it a one star I hate this book any want to read it I wish them luck but I would not recommend it to read	0
9416	A2K9HIW5LDKLZN	Did not like this to much the story line was only about sex needed more substance to catch my attention	2
9417	AA1UMDOV44T2Q	This book was really bad. I tried to finish it but it was so bad I gave up on this one.	0
9418	A1X3KK90QE27EU	Another pretty good Special Ops book from Roger Grubbs and moves along pretty quickly, but it is pretty one dimensional.	2
9419	A1PH7S0NFZZXKC	I really enjoyed reading these short stories. Great for in between books or waiting at an appointment. Keeps you laughing at everyday life	2
9420	A16DBPMT1PM4L7	AGAIN, IT'S FREE, SO HOW CAN YOU COMPLAIN? HOWEVER, I LIKE MANY OTHER BOOKS BETTER AND DO HAVE MANY OTHERS BETTER..	2
9421	A1TGWJIH8MEA56	I will definitely try a few of these recipes. I liked the pecan rolls recipe the best. Can't wait to try it!	2
9422	A39JK9SMJ8W6J3	No much detail to the story line.  Could not get into the story.  Kind of lame,but many romance are that way.	2
9423	A3TY9TQV0ZEG90	Two college kid experimenting with sex. I laughed because it was kind of cute and innocent. I give it 3 and 1/2 stars because it wasn't that bad.	2
9424	A24HEBBVCFQQFL	Should have come with the Kindle Fire HD. I feel this is a necessary device and should be included in price.	1
9425	A2ORZ3QVBGOCON	Nothing much here. Save your time and read something else. His other books are better, but I'd skip this one	0
9426	A610JQLR1VUOI	I wish that this was longer. It was good and full of suspension.I would recommend this book to anyone.	2
9427	A1DYW808OMMTFE	I enjoyed most of this book, but it was lacking in parts and I was left feeling slightly disappointed in the book.	2
9428	A1TNVUMSPY8BM1	Overall ok read. Lots of drama. Seems a little rushed but will get the second book to see what happens.	2
9429	A3ANJTUGAE7JKI	The author must have a very bad life or is bitter to always start out happy and then to make sure it has an unhappy ending.	0
9430	A3T8IXHNZJLIJE	Guess I shouldn't wait so long to rate the books I read this was a nice book, nothing special just something to pass the time	2
9431	A3PPSRUYLC3LN1	The Escape Company is a fast-paced caper full of adventure.  The tension will keep readers on their toes!  Farndon has far to go with his writing.	2
9432	A3SUQ51GLKSFUI	Was not happy and not was as expected. Was expecting a full book not just a group of first chapters of different books.	0
9433	A1VXNA0FJTRQ63	Unfortunately I did not read all of the stories in this collection,I couldn't get into a lot of them but for free they were so so.	2
9434	AJCN08RD7B3EL	Good read I enjoyed it .I'm glad it didn't go much longer as it would have been to much but still good	2
9435	A1VC3VFW2N7ZK0	Have tried twice to read this book but couldn't get into it.  Immediately did not like any of the characters.  Sorry!	1
9436	A9M27LYHUWFJ9	A book needs a plot and all this does is talk about sex and how to get more, didn't even finish it	0
9437	A8L8U6N8J2QSH	It was cute. Had some errors and could use an editor.  Was a bit different than expected for a historical novel.	2
9438	A1FED7P4TU735R	Cute short story, but my enjoyment was cut short by spelling, incorrect word usage and general sloppy editing or possibly no editing. This really cut into my enjoyment	2
9439	A19B0UB53D820Y	If you enjoy giving personalized presents and love crafts, then this is for you! Projects vary in difficulty so it will appeal to amateurs and professionals alike.	2
9440	A19VGGE3VLMW7P	I liked her other books better.  This book felt dragged out - impressive for being only 39 pages long.  Give her other ones a try though!	2
9441	AYNV5KAFW891J	I liked the series but the books could have been longer. I did like the story line and the chacters in the book	2
9442	A2SKQ2F1H8OUWP	Boy meats boy and they are both susprised.  Yes, I used the synanom that I intended to use...A decent piece of fluff..	2
9443	AMHGWCWTPARMU	Enjoyable but so much like many others. Nothing original. Nothing to really make me want to read any more of this story.	2
9444	A1SC82YA0I3542	I really enjoyed this book. It's the first one I have read in this series. I look forward to reading more in the series.	2
9445	A25KVVIREFBWXT	I couldn't get into the story, as a results I did not finish the book.  Sorry, but thank you for asking.	2
9446	A22OQHV0ZNKQ4G	Short stories I expected. More from. A little fun but each story had so much potential and didn't.come close. Would have made a good out line for so much more	2
9447	A8MA17A15XQDC	It was hard to believe that an investigation would be carried on this way, which made it hard to get into.	2
9448	AYE81SYLKA4TR	It was good but not as erotic as I had hoped. Would recommend to my friends though.  It was nice to read a book where the roles were reversed	2
9449	A99GG15LRG29E	Maybe it's because I am the age I am but these are stale jokes.  I suppose that's because it is a children's book.	1
9450	A2WZ7GIK5XTE09	It was a warm and heartfelt book that was a great way to pass the time. I just loved it.	2
9451	A375E8PGFFF135	Since it was free, worth the time it took to read. Spent a pleasurable afternoon. Otherwise, nothing to write home about.	2
9452	A3J16VPWJ5PL3S	I did not like any of it.  In fact I had to delete it from my books.  In trying to be funny it was disgusting to me...	0
9453	AN64MG0PEGE8X	Many recipes for many types of salads. Diet or not. Meat containing recipes also. Something for everyone. Well put together as well.	2
9454	A2M1QYOWLBGRHT	I really liked the story as far as it went.  I would like to read the rest of it to see how it ends.	2
9455	A3EPSATLEMFL9K	Sweet, romance and I was able to download for free.Old lovers, meet at a rodeo....Not only  did Megan, find Pax, she continued her love with Sam, her horse.....	2
9456	A1PGWKMQ63YYGT	This was a very nice and interesting read. I would recommend this short story . It has an element of sadness and surprise.	2
9457	A2U9SYN7TNH7HE	Didn't even get through the first paragraph without swearing. I find it offensive and therefore it's not a clean read. Deleted immediately. Disappointed. Unnecessary swearing.	0
9458	A1I7VZM3LCG33M	Stories too short for adequate character and plot development.  It was difficult to feel any rapport or caring for such sketchy characters.	1
9459	A32AGVI4MM4JUK	It was a good idea for a story, but it  just missed.  It must have been an early work, because I do enjoy Amy Cross's stories.	2
9460	A35GF6W8Y1NEPP	This Kindle stylus  was not very durable.  The rubber's already worn off, and I'd have to buy a one stylus.	0
9461	A1ZFNC0WWZOMIC	A painful read to say the least.  I could go on but I'm exhausted from trying to make sense of this dribble.	0
9462	A18SZWCF5882S1	The short story and its sister Tranquility have great potential as stories, if you are looking for a quick read, with a bit of naughtiness, then this is your thing...	2
9463	A1UTNYFFVJBOUI	The grammar was bafflingly bad. Like, BAD, bad. The premise is good. The story could have been so much more. I am sad it wasn't better.	1
9464	ASIJZMQ2ARBH8	This was a great book but it was definitely way too short & everything happened way too fast. A little disappointing.	2
9465	A33TA4K8TO0MJH	This is a fast-moving, humorously written book, which is slightly unbelievable with regards to its story-line. Very light-hearted and entertaining though. Will not challenge you mentally.	2
9466	A4GPZZ5ESA56L	I had to put this book down.  There wasn't enough substance for me to keep reading it.  I don't think I'll be reading much from this author.	1
9467	A2MXHH2IKU4UWJ	The pictures are relatively cute. However, I agree with other reviewers that said they really overused the word silly tho.	2
9468	ATANE2SC44592	This short story was a fun way to pass 30 minutes. I haven't read any of the Callahan Garrity Mysteries so this story has me curious!	2
9469	A22GHKAQRWC1WS	A fancy name for not much of anything.  This was a silly tale with unbelievable characters. No more Saucy McGill mysteries for me.	0
9470	A1HDK3B3Q23SRV	Good reading, had fun reading it! Interesting insights on the high life of billionaires... but surprisingly there are no twists or turns, pretty predictable plot.	2
9471	A2CJ13FU2LWN2T	okay read. Some things didn't match up and a lot of ridiclousness. But mostly easy and nice read.Definetly not my favorite but a nice change.	2
9472	A23WEMR6HY38W2	Just couldn't get into it-first chapter has this guy killing a Zombie the chattering away like a magpie in a bar-yuk	1
9473	A1HJ7OJUU6HGRP	This was a nice, slow and gentle read. It wasn't very long and I did enjoy From Friends to Lovers.	2
9474	A3BC4Y1076DX58	This couple has been married for a while, so to make things interesting, they decide to play a little role play of the rough rider with the stranded motorist.	1
9475	AMRY8K73SGO7G	It was okay.  I did get some ideas to make some interesting things out of bottles. It helped to get my creative juices flowing.	2
9476	A1A5NJ3XVNC4CD	IT is a good clean book Every one can read IT in the Family.we feel in LOVE with THE dog.	2
9477	AKVL9OYN9D0WA	its not a complete story. its one of those episode types. i didnt find the story believable. and thought both the h and the H dumb. sorry	1
9478	A3UTRJZJYDN8M0	Craziness. Plain and simple. Im hoping there will be a book two to fill in all the questions i have	2
9479	A2PBLD5IF8MWYJ	I found the dialogue and character development frustrating in this book.  The female lead couldn't make up her mind about anything!  Also, the editing was horrible.	1
9480	A38SN4VUKBCX2Y	This book was so boring that I only read about 5%.  I kept hoping that it would get better, as I've read many of Bartal's books; but it didn't.	0
9481	A26AH4MQ7NJGTX	This book was interesting. It was something different. It kept my attention, was a good way to combine erotica and horror	1
9482	A3JUTTIFPQXJ8K	Quinn and Sylvia, what a pair. This story ended too soon, but knowing that this is a small town, there is much left to this story.	2
9483	A16VCL7MJQC56F	I don't remember what this is about	2
9484	AJHFQ3CB5TBEP	The book was good but kind of alllll over the place but still not too hard to follow...it was decent for a freebie. I wud get part2	1
9485	A319NIGXKIFSSW	This book has way too much explicit sex. Leave something to the imagination - it would make it MUCH more interesting. Could not finish it. I do not recommend it.	0
9486	A3NU67E0HOBIFG	I read it all but toward the end it got way too weird.  Dysfunctional family too the extreme and then the transvestite having a baby just just way too much.	1
9487	A1RTVWTWZSIC94	Not my type of book	0
9488	A63FKF0FTK8DQ	Fair read but so many characters to keep track of. The neighbor is a hoot with his long lost love.	2
9489	A2YA001RXGQRNR	The title says it all.  the directions will be better.  The pictures will be better.  The format will be better.	2
9490	A3KDLLT957CNSM	The story was too short to give me the opportunity to connect to any of the characters. Ok if you are looking for a super fast read with instant romance.	2
9491	A2KI4K1BVIU51Q	A wonderful series that tells of the emotions all of us have and how they make us who we are.	2
9492	A1C1TL7Y4D7A9H	I read this story. I am not sure if it was good enough for a second read. It was predictable.	2
9493	AWMLUBCEVMGRZ	Could not get interested in this story. Not for me.I have not read it and I won't be reading it either.	0
9494	A1F4I2SANSF5H9	I really didn't like this book because it's just not interesting to me.  The book is well written and will be enjoyable to others.	2
9495	A2SV5G759BE177	This needs some serious editing. The writing just didn't flow well for me. It felt like it was a teenagers first attempt at writing.I won't be reading part 2.CST	1
9496	AOE45CTKJ1CNU	I think this book was all over the place..Pam was really the main character ,I hope part two will be much better..	1
9497	A311PPG2UBENEE	This book is hard to follow and jumps around so much, you can't keep track with what is going on. I read about 10 pages and then gave up.	0
9498	A293W2MU6STRGP	Great character development in a family where each got equal billing introduces a series that promises to provide great reading.dottiek	2
9499	A12Z0IYZWWKCS5	good for beginners.  nice use of scraps & colors.looks like a fun one for when I am between big projects	2
9500	A18EEC1ENOT9YN	This is a type of writing that will be enjoyable to some people.  There are so many writers out there doing the same kind of writing material.	1
9501	A324ODS0NPPT9	Memory's of teen year and the history at the time  of growing not a pleasant book to read at fireside	2
9502	A2CO4LGCFM8TH1	I couldnt get passed the first few chapters. The book is explicit. Not what I want to read at all.	0
9503	A3TTWXH6MCC8CL	Actually, I didn't finish this. I've discovered that menages, for whatever reason, just aren't my thing, for the most part.	1
9504	A27LD195Y7IJ53	This was my first book by Ms. Pillows and while I enjoyed the story and characters the book moved a bit slower than I like.	2
9505	A7F7Y5TY87J8T	author did wonderful job; can't say same about editor.many grammatical, typing and punctuation errors.still with the read.enjoyed most of book	2
9506	A3VKF16GL07S64	This book was beyond silly. I really don't get the items they gave her or how she could be so ........yuck! This was just rounchy!	1
9507	A23EZTR5P2R0MA	Pretty cool, though could have been better.	2
9508	AJC3NRA4QD9IT	Read the 4 bundled books, and its just okay for me, not something that will melt your heart and remember the characters afterwards.	1
9509	A1J5DBIEI2ULMM	i like the first 2 stories but wasnt very thrilled with the other ones, they were worth reading but im glad i didnt get them by themselves	2
9510	A2GDI5KGGEYNSL	Didn't capture my attention so I never read it. Read the first few pages wasn't interested in it. Thank you	0
9511	ADSB7SEDF5P5N	Not a bad read. The story is kind of hard to imagine. Could have left out some details and included others	2
9512	A1MNYNH3DCTVSH	It was ok.  I was expecting more from it because I just finished Dom by Default.  So after that it waskind of a disapointment.	1
9513	AGBVD0HF3MLEQ	I chose this rating because I did not think this was one of her best books.  Some of the earlier ones were much better.	2
9514	A1BW2E42DOPZPN	I was expecting something at least interesting, it just reads like a re-hash of old newspaper articles...boring. Save your time for a much better read.	0
9515	A22ZJ11DIOJYXW	This book was actually kind of boring after you got into it. I finished it just because I had gotten so far, but wouldn't say it was worth the time.	2
9516	A3K236UVB5EOAB	This story was wonderful and romantic. I couldn't put it down so I read it in one day. Can't wait to read other books by Elizabeth Lennox.	1
9517	A2WPEJH5WQW6JK	This book is very confusing.I'm still trying to figure it all out.it kind of goes round and round.I wouldn't tell others about the book	2
9518	AOQZ05LNZ0C8J	I admie the men who went to war and served in the service of their country but this book is quite mundane or ordinary.	1
9519	A3UHVC1EF8OYRF	weirdly written, no real instructions or measurements.  formatting and grammar incorrect. seems to be dictated by a non English speaker and not proofread. odd ingredients.	0
9520	A2RWBJA6JWWL6K	Good story. Well written, but I was unable in really get into the story and had no desire to read the second one.	2
9521	A37QXFDRRQ9M08	The Sheriff's Mistletoe Law was entertaining but not long enough to really get a lot out of the story. I was looking for a special story.	1
9522	A38PZNDNFUW6ZX	Grabbed this free read to check out this author who was new to me..... and oh yea I was in the mood for a racy romance.'s Germany did not disappoint!	2
9523	A2C4K7QUE2TT6C	I did not enjoy this at all. I thought it was offensive and has no plot. The sex scenes were horrible. Don't waste your time.	0
9524	A17FERG69CTZJN	The writing was very good, but the story did not leave me in enough suspense that I would want to eagerly snap up the next book.	0
9525	AA4AVFLEQQ7YR	A good short read. Interesting plot. My problem was poor editing. Someone dropped the ball in this case. Too bad	2
9526	A25GGBPJI4HBRP	Wasn't long enough to keep me entertained for long nor was the story good enough to make me want it to BE longer.	0
9527	A31SQHOVLXGHXV	If you like crime and lots of death read this book. A bit hard to follow and figure out  just okay	2
9528	A1IOR3OTTUK3O5	i like bosch, but so hard to get into a story that just ends.....i guess a good quick read.... ok	1
9529	A4GO81BSRAXV2	Very informative little book on beer making.  Three different processes but near identical steps.  I've got to try these recipes!  I've got to find a kit.  Very informative!	2
9530	A3SHJB358MLNV9	Mediocre at best, no real sense of passion or connection between characters, but free and ok to kill a little time.	2
9531	A25CP6UY1I2W5X	Not very easy to read. Written rather &#34;chopily&#34;.  Not interested in following this series. Too many misspellings to keep story line running freely.	0
9532	A3CZC1IS91K0F9	This was way too short. I was just getting into the story and it was over. I liked all the facts but it could had more story lines.	2
9533	A4ISDR92X8J7B	Not what I expected.  Don't know anyone I would recommend it to.  Guess I didn't know enough not to buy it.	1
9534	A20R37WRPLUM1D	A great romance, good character development, and enough well written sex to keep things interesting! There is the expectation that they will reach their HEA and that's OK, too.	2
9535	A2022DBPO4TPL4	Not enough content story was okay, but it wasn't worth the 5. 89 I spent for it  Also, not enough pages	2
9536	A2HPEYWJ6WXSX9	some of the items look very good, and I'm planning on making something from it tomorrow for dinner, looking forward to trying something good and healthy	2
9537	A14J2Z35C96U4H	It was not what I was expecting.  I'm able huge fan of Treasure, but this story felt rushed as well as having a lot of recaps from Fallon Story.	2
9538	A1ZEAIFYSHNZ9B	I wanted to like this book, really. I though here is another contemporary paranormal read . Oh my I easily  wrong! It is BORING and made very little sense.	1
9539	A31MOTCE0X4F1C	Must admit that this was a disappointing read. Minimal if any depth and poor story line if you could say there was one.	0
9540	A16P4OR7U882AK	Had a little trouble diving in to this one but still a well told story and lots of fun! Happy reading!	2
9541	A027216626S6GHZAIP80D	Probably get the next book when it's available. Easy to read, don't need to think too hard to enjoy the book.	2
9542	A1MPZ3A6XEGA3O	HAVEN'T READ all of this series, however i think they all will be good. like the story plots and that they get married.	2
9543	A33H49912EHLSX	It was ok.  Some of the story was really hot but I probably wouldn't read it again.  It was free so I didn't mind.	2
9544	A29BYZAN5QKX0L	I couldn't wait for it to end, it was so boring. I don't even know what to say. I am not saying don't buy it after all it free.	1
9545	A1XII1TRWZ0Y7D	I didn't realize that this selection was a short story. It was very good but I was expecting more. It was,however very thought provoking.	2
9546	A2MNJQMGB1SCFG	Really.....a 13 year old smarter than the us government including his dad!  Sounds like something Tom crews would want to star in as a kid!	2
9547	A1D5OZWXHILG0A	The synopsis sounded good for this book. However, I was very disappointed. There was almost no character building. And it felt rushed. I thought it was awful.	0
9548	A3CUF4S3NMP4CL	I got the books as the summary was interesting.  I don't know if I would purchase this authors books again.	2
9549	A2LOHBARGTFQVV	I am giving this book the same rating that I gave Book 3 because whereas the characters are likeable the storyline is preductable. I wouldn't recommend it.	2
9550	AE5IA4M4NQLY	A very cute, very short story. It was perfect for an overcast sky and too humid to do anything sort of day. A real burst of sunshine.	2
9551	A2QU72989CEE6L	It was good, had a clean and decent storyline, no bad words. Look forward to her next book in line.	2
9552	A3M8HRUFXJK8SA	was hoping for more nit little side notes we all write from time to time , it was dull very	0
9553	A3HPANTP72UGWE	Wouldn't spend money on this one weird sort of story.  Not very well written and took forever to finish. About gave up several times.	0
9554	A3EFT3OMWYR0C2	Was not aware it was excerpts. Just as you get familiar with characters and storyline it cut off.  Obviously a good tease.	1
9555	AD3U7SUD678CA	I paid for a book and only got a chapter, I was disappointed. I loved the 118 pages just wish it was a FULL book :(	0
9556	A6ZG04TN8WO3E	Good storyline and good characterslooking forward to more in the seriesI enjoyed this author this is the first book I have read by Patricia McLinn	2
9557	A197W8MNF706HT	Boy, I wish I had an alpha to make my wolf come out. A nice short story with some sex, but not panty wetting.	2
9558	A3DQR5IHRVCML9	Yes but not for long. Where are all these knights in shining armour? IIt was a decent read I think	2
9559	AQTD6HHJ4Q132	This had some ideas I'd consider for next year.  It's sweet and ties in doing things together with friends and family.	2
9560	A1UOS0IM2GP87S	An playbook. Short and sweet without much depth. About 2 army docs who find an abandoned newborn, fall in love and marry.	2
9561	A2V32IAZKHHF3B	I really didn't enjoy this one all that much.  I enjoy erotica, but this one just didn't do that much for me.  I found myself losing focus throughout the book.	1
9562	A2XMUTV0PL4HL2	Author should find an editor.  If his books had at least B- grammar instead of D-/F grammar I would be giving them 4-5 stars.	1
9563	A7XBZRUKL7D6C	A bit trite, and rather unbelievable.  If you want  a romance in which everyone lives happily ever after, even though it is very  contrived you might like this story.	2
9564	A3T0SXI6Z9TKBI	This cookbook contains basic tomato recipes which are helpful to get you started cooking with fresh tomatoes. The recipes are easy to follow. No nonsense. No pictures.	2
9565	A16NOA3DB7G1SR	I liked the book.  The story line is well developed and fast paced.  The characters are believable and it was a hard book to put down.	2
9566	A2B79HNXXOO85K	I found this book interesting. I am a history buff, particulary of the Civil War era and this was a story I had not heard before.	2
9567	A320DBAN4YCCNQ	It is a fun story and sweet, cute, funny, sexy story, but it ended very abruptly. I dislike paying for books that are SO short!	2
9568	AHDSLGP28Y1PW	It was an enjoyable read. A little short but nice nevertheless. I also felt it was a bit rushed,but it was nice.	2
9569	A3EY6U4RY2S2P1	Really interesting uptake.A strong female character lead. Not the  simpering, weak kneed damsel in trouble.Going to read the next volume.	2
9570	A3C9V987IQHOQD	O K Book I was not expecting a war book. If you like horses and some interesting fiction this could be your book.	2
9571	A7VZ77MAX9NXJ	not worth what you have to spend to read it but good book but idon't recomend it till it's free	2
9572	A272TYBAA4EC3R	Light read. Historical romance timepiece. Characters seemed real, likeable, and interesting. Strong female characters for the time period which made interesting.	2
9573	A37ISWGLU1A1FB	This just would never happen, not the story, I'm sure it happens all the time, but big corporations and lots of political corruption getting caught? NOPE.	2
9574	A23KXFOQHFET4Q	But there are some fun recipes in here.  And since it was free, I decided to add it to my cookbook collection on my Kindle.	2
9575	A2LAII96I1O1IY	The book was good reading, until l got to the end and felt like I was just left hanging. It's very unsettling to have no conclusion.	2
9576	A3V6J8AGMYDO5	Have not even finished the book yet, as I found it to be a little drawn out and not very realistic.	1
9577	A22BZ8XZQKVHOI	Why did I even select this book? It started off good, but when it got so visual it throw me off for a loop. Not my favorite at all. Scary!	2
9578	A1Q8QKKXDN0E3G	This book is worthless. It gives the reader little to no information on anything and only a couple designs. Too bad ZERO STARS is not an option! DELETED.	0
9579	A1WSYWXKQOAFXQ	This book has all kinds of potential, yet the poor editing left me rather confused and annoyed at times. Hoping the next one is better!	2
9580	A3361XGKYF17S3	This book was ok I guess. I ending up skipping pages. I tried reading again but did not get thru it.	2
9581	AKCZAZFYKPQE7	I couldn't finish this short story. I found it very depressing and couldn't find anything to make me want to finish it.... yea... enough said...	0
9582	A265UILPJEMOWL	Didn't care for it.  Really don't like books that are written in parts the way this one is.  Just finish the story in one book.	1
9583	A2RQ3W2CL0F8Z2	This book was rather boring for the series. It revisited one of the earlier couples, but failed to really provide anything new. Just so/so.	1
9584	ACG272OHY22ET	All its about is a dog talking to a stuffed toy about his kibble and life. It's not funny. It's not even dry humour.	0
9585	ARCAQR5BQM952	I am all about short stories but this one was just dumb and severely lacking.  Even more annoying was the book ended at 47% with the rest being previews.	0
9586	A2L53JVFF1PWHH	Wow this was definitely a good read, didn't see that coming at the end though. Must read part 2 now.	2
9587	A1N7HQ1U337JJP	It was not a bad book, but not a great book, will get the next in the series, hoping that it grows into itself.	2
9588	A2C7CA9AKTFTFI	It's a ok book book but it was just to drawn out for me I felt like it was never going to end.	2
9589	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	This was a completely pointless waste of time. Did the peeper learn his lesson?  Maybe, but really who cares?  Dumb story.	1
9590	A3EPSATLEMFL9K	Quick read. Free download.  Not too bad of a read..starting of a series. The book revolves around two couples...Matt and Kayla...Evan and Angie...the Lassiter family entwined....	2
9591	A3CTOKY0PKLX57	This was interesting.  Some parts were confusing and some wasn't really believable.  It was fast-paced and creepy, a decent thriller.	2
9592	A6JNRRZF1C7WT	Not a bad read. I really get turned off by the instant love thing, which is what we have here,but this is an entertaining story to kill a slow evening.	2
9593	A1TBQ5SA7FSLCJ	Just too short for me. Good book just a little more thought of the plot and it would have been even better. Thanks	2
9594	A2IQJ8SJIRW56R	I wish I hadn't read it, it was not at all what I thought it would be about. I hope that the author's other stories are more satisfying.	0
9595	A2F7YOE5Y1E4E9	My Grandson doesn't care for this one at all, and he loves to be read to every night before bed.	0
9596	A2HQWU6HUKIEC7	Parents abandon their child at an amusement park. It's a kid's worst nightmare and neither funny nor entertaining. Deleted immediately.	0
9597	A3798UU0L5DCM7	I HATE BUYING A BOOK WITH STORIES I HAVE ALREADY READ. I DO ENJOY JAY ALLEN AS A WRITER HE MAKES THINGS READABLE	2
9598	A2ORVDBLSYNVVE	I gave it 2 stars because there were a few jokes that were moderately funny, but none of them made me LOL...	1
9599	A2OPG80Y8IAIGM	this book was pretty easy to follow even though it jumped around a lot. not for younger ya readers though.	2
9600	AYLLMWR1136Q0	I am. Not a fan of short clips of books or excerpt, I prefer complete stories instead of bits a d pieces	0
9601	A38VFYFUTYJ0T5	In general I enjoyed the book, and the world the author has created is very interesting.  I would likely read more in this series should they come along.	2
9602	AJOC82HDWL86E	I m not really into the whole angel romance but it was interesting .definitely not one of my favorites though. but for those who like angel themes it was good.	2
9603	A1FSR426FVMQJI	Clever twist on a mindset usually held by males. None of the characters were compelling enough to read more of this series.	2
9604	A34ZHL1UF6G3D9	i would have given it a 4 if it was longer and it did not have spelling errors. it is a buy	2
9605	A1SXMAPSNC0ODQ	Did not find this funny. I guess I do not have this sense of humour. I thought it would be a lighthearted story.	0
9606	A2KFG7MKA5YNS4	Nicely written and pretty straight forward. The story was well told. Some of the sexual encounters were odd and the ending too quick for my taste.	2
9607	A3VPF5FXBB6SU5	Love the Story and intro to the second and third books. It  will keep your interest; Good story and light reading	2
9608	A3R7D2ZOP4YDTJ	I waited all summer and fall for the release and although it was good, I feel like everything could've been wrapped up in chapter 3.	1
9609	A2KJK4A779XGZ8	I enjoyed this book.  Light enough to be entertaining but still a good bit of suspense to keep the pages turning. Looking forward to next installment.	2
9610	A2INLBFV40W1R3	I just thought it was okay. I might go on to chapter two. But not sure. I'd rent  I t before I'd buy it.Review  by KMA	2
9611	A2UQ8WQFSZ2Z0	You will lose my business if you use your enforced advertising for a political agenda. If I want propaganda, I will watch MSNBC.	0
9612	A3MAITGXI6HHI8	I enjoyed this book and the interaction of the main characters. It has a few inconsistencies and jumps around a little but worth reading.	2
9613	A3QDHLMYO2GWTD	Easy, fast read. Likable characters. H/h has chemistry and spark. Nothing too complex plot twists.Could have been a bit longer story.	2
9614	AVA5AKBH39383	I really did not get this book at all. The ending had me confused as to who killed the parents.	1
9615	ATX2V4OQWV86W	It didn't keep my attention and took me a long time to finish because I just wasn't interested in it	2
9616	A1D1O6KEVFFO9H	I bought the second book hoping to finish the series. Instead you give me maxons point of view retelling the book! It could have been a really good series.	0
9617	A2CU6038UJE1LL	I thought the stories were quite boring.  I usually love a good ghost story, but these just didn't do it for me.	0
9618	A3IR6UYI01Q26A	Possibly designed for the teen-aged reader, this was difficult to get through. Interesting storyline, but a bit too under-developed to say that I loved it.	2
9619	A293MJV7OBALZ8	A simple story that warms the heart.  Short and sweet, predictable. Fate has its way of entertaining hearts whatever plans may be made.	2
9620	A2QZKYRH1C0HB2	It was a good read. The wooden box is still a mystery, would have liked more on this. I will read the next book.	2
9621	AF2AWPOVWQQGU	This was a good read & fun. It kept my attention to the end. I recommend it if you want romantic novel that's fun to read.	2
9622	A1DKQCC90FY7NX	I love to read these two authors.  But did not seem to get into this one.  Always one that no one cares for.	2
9623	A1K7CTYOWPM4EM	Nice light reading. Naturally all the brothers are fantastic and all the women are thin and beautiful! Not a lot of surprises here.	2
9624	A2ULMX4MXETY82	Perhaps that covers it for me, although I almost gave up on it several times I didn't  and  finished it! Curious what other folks thought of it?	2
9625	A18LEU6NM43CX0	I was not able to read more than the first chapter of this book. I was so disappointedwith the language, it was explicit and extremely vulgar.	0
9626	A3MK7JXTC29UJO	Not good at all. Both stories had good plot s but the ending s were horrible. This author should give up the ghost.	1
9627	A1BHKXBTU8VQR9	This is not my genre, so I did not read the whole book.  The Ressurrected is about paranormal.  Not interested	2
9628	A1NRYBG1S12V5M	I loved this tale of Jax and Nikki.  However, I was left with questions regarding Lori and Bec.  A book about them would be great!!	2
9629	A2HDU31C22PFNI	It's the editing and missed words and punctuation that stymied me. Grammar check might if help. A good proofreader would have picked up on a lot of the issues.,	2
9630	A21IFB0UU234UW	It workflow much better in the voices were not just switching.  Very choppy read.  It was free so not bad.	1
9631	A32AUTWA8MM81K	Refreshing for the hero to be so sweet and attentive.  But, the heroine seemed a little undeserving of him.  Their love story sweet.  A little crass.	2
9632	A3MMC9EI9QYIHF	I stopped reading after the first few pages.  Characters turned me off.	0
9633	A3JGY8WYUZBU6D	The sample was awesome, but the story itself fell flat for me. I just wish that there was more to their story than the recycled set-ups and cliche circumstance.	2
9634	AQAN0FUQKPBKF	The book was good but don't know if I would recommend it to anyone.	2
9635	A3A7DAC19FOY6H	I was hoping for more and expecting more. All of the information seemed to be objective but not very new or helpful.	2
9636	A1IJP6P1XEY051	With life anything can be and is? In conversation and someone ask where did I get the information from I wouldRecommend this book.	2
9637	A1U7MB6RWCYUKC	By the time it got started it was over. I think this book may have been good but the story just started to make me interested. What was They?	0
9638	A2F7YOE5Y1E4E9	Kind of silly at times and a bit easy to predict but maybe it was meant more for young adults than for a grownup.	2
9639	AO1SIRDCKMHXI	It was an OK read. Kind of interesting but ...  I didn't know if this was 1st chapter or the entire story.	2
9640	A3JSOW0OWP5TD4	I liked the story but I thought it was a little long. I think it could have been shortened up a little.	1
9641	A1RL0KL0Y8FMC9	This is your traditional maid story.  It's nothing very special and very average.  If you're looking for a very interesting story then this won't be it.	2
9642	A1R2Y2G0DKY52H	Not too bad. Held my interest but wouldn't read it again. It wasn't the type of book that I couldn't put down but it was one I wanted to finish.	2
9643	A20CJZ359J46GM	It's not great literature. It's not intended to be. It's a bunch of short, one-panel comics that make you laugh. It does it's job.	2
9644	A2N1S8ZXS93B33	Your average historical, or should i say pirate-viking romance, adequately written, predictable, and won't dissappoint if you are into these kinds of books.	2
9645	A3TJ05GGNHV10D	Hope to c more from this author. Read it quickly . And it kept my interest. Worth the price . Read it . U won't b disappointed	2
9646	A2KZD1S8GUHSG9	I enjoyed this book very much. The novel in some ways reminded me of some Mich Rapp books I have read.	0
9647	A3KM6X2HCAQLLK	I hated this book.  I wasted my time and money buying and reading this book.Probably will not buy any more books by this author.	0
9648	A37M97TBODVIQ8	I do not care for USA Today and got the app by mistake.  It is already off my Kindle Fire.	0
9649	A38I2YE5DPF9PT	Very short story with a really bizarre storyline. Not sure if I would read anything like it again. Not sure even how the idea could have come about.	2
9650	A1DHNXGHDH9OST	I was a little disappointed. There was not a whole lot to the book. Not much depth of characters or story line.	2
9651	A3Q5DCWNAUW3B0	Although I enjoyed reading this story somewhat, it didn't thrill me as much as others. It was just okay.Not sure I'd take time to read the rest of this series	2
9652	AXFW1QY3EIEVA	It seemed to need more depth, or perhaps it just did not speak to me personally. I kept reading hoping for something that I never found.	2
9653	A3ZBNXS6YACZQ	I forgot how short stories were really short! I enjoyed the story line and the characters.  Maybe I will check out the author's other works.	2
9654	A3GFQDC7240EZR	This book was a good story.  It was a interesting tale with interesting characters.  It did feel a little rushed.	2
9655	A1I5L545PT578C	White Cougar was a little far out for me.  I did enjoy it as I enjoy reading most anything  but I won't reread it.	2
9656	A37KUIWITOF90M	Fairly quick moving story, with some interesting characters. Story ends rather abruptly. If your expect a full novel you,ll be disappointed this really just a Novella.	2
9657	APGDVSZ243MZY	This book is exactly as it was described on the page where I acquired it. It does what I expected it to do.	2
9658	A1CAOMN19AZ5KQ	I found this book to be  very boring. sorry didnt hold my attention. I cant reccomend this book to others.	1
9659	A1I3UXFDNEAS1N	Very informative read on what to do in the event of a natural disaster. Most information is common sense. Would like to see  a book on unnatural disasters.	2
9660	A2QKX55GW8PRSN	The characters jumped into heavy breathing and intimate situations a bit too fast to be believable and the lifeforms were not at all sympathetic to me.	1
9661	A3IQ5HVRNPSB0X	Good story and likable characters here just wasn't enough depth o completely understand what was going on and the inexplicable attraction between them. I wanted more.	2
9662	A2LLWCQVYKYF0F	It was instead a romantic novel, not well written, reviewed or edited. two pages about a casserole and then served pot roast	1
9663	A1IP7665UQIWAI	I didn't like this book  I just couldn't get the story drift, to me it didn't have a very begining.  Millie	2
9664	A2PXCI4RGK60LQ	Unreadable content. Not happy with this copy of the book.	0
9665	AUYZAER8INUE6	It took a while before I got into the story, then I ended up liking it. Good fast read for anyone	2
9666	AMA0NEOXU7PSB	It was ok short thou th tough witch isn't fair at all... that was a waist of minutes so I hate it	2
9667	A2Z8A1W957DXRU	I thought this novella would fill in some gaps left wide open by the trilogy & subsequent novellas... no. It was a big let-down.	1
9668	A2XRZLIVYWU4FO	"Sweet story set in my hometown but told in annoying first person present tense.  Repeated use of substandard ""anyways"" was also annoying.  The free price was about right."	1
9669	A2OAY1UFN99HSX	I was hoping it would be a full length novel. i give this 1star because nothing really happened. i was disappointed.	0
9670	A3028P2ZHNY7A9	Long and not well written.  Errors in grammar, choice of words and formatting.  Rose and Travis did make an interesting pair and story.	1
9671	A16AFTYWI0DYRW	This is a formulaic romance wrapped in a thin coat of mystery.  If you've read ten romance novels, you've read this one too.	1
9672	AFC97KDPMJHXG	The book was good but the ending could have been better... maybe with an epilogue. Glad it was just $.99.	1
9673	A3I6WZMCTU6FOZ	I enjoyed this short story, but its shortness was also frustrating.  I would have liked it to be much longer.	2
9674	A2QCM7USXLIO7P	The story was basically boring. The bad guys weren't worth the time spent. I mean, why bother? Other than their short lived appearance, there was little else to do.	2
9675	A342FBV09E91NR	Great book to read,the story line keeps you wanting more. wish it was a little longer. Can't wait for the next one to come out.	2
9676	ADWUYON0NGW0V	THE WRITING WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT THE CHARACTERS REALLY JUST NEVER CLICKED FOR ME. IT WAS JUST AN OK COPY OF THE SAME OLD MC STORY, JUST NOT AS EXCITING.	2
9677	A4YCF2LQ6PER3	Hope I can remember the material in the book. :)  There are so many How to do books but the basics are always there.	2
9678	A29T92HFUVM2NT	The relationship between Hope and Lucas was interesting and funny but sadly predictable. It's an ok story nothing I'll read again.	2
9679	A3HG5UNRWJSGI7	It's only a short story, sad but all too real. It was well written and very relatable. I just wish there was more.	2
9680	ADJ88NZ470HHI	A little too slow for my reading pleasure....towards the end it started to pick up and get better... A little too late	2
9681	A37SGKF23407IZ	I like the first three installments of Legal Action but this short novella or story was not up to Ms. Lee's other books.	1
9682	A1SERMB4JPASY3	Think the story would have been much better if the central character hadn't interjected his feelings/ideas/smart mouth during story and conversations.  So, I did not finish the book.	1
9683	A2TF6G6Q7ZTW8C	I couldn't get threw it...she even worried everyone in the beginning. All the books were the same...I'm sorry I didn't like it	0
9684	A3FZ5R9XQC9JIV	the Idea was good, it was a dif twist, but the delivery and the ending was a fail.  I actually felt bad at the end.	2
9685	A82QDUVX9LT5Q	Very good story though awful short.  It would make a great long book.  Enjoyed reading it  bit would enjoy more.	2
9686	A3MTU1QAMYEAX3	Much too vulgar for me to read. No romance seems to be involved just raw sex to me which is a turnoff.	1
9687	A1V555JQB94P19	I like the story,but it is tedious reading for me. Repeats itself on occasions.  Will skip the other. Looks in the trilogy for that reason.	2
9688	A3UDEHONV7VZ8O	Ian Dalton's books have a small story line but lots of sex in lots of positions.  It gets tiresome after awaile	1
9689	A1G2GCRY91SKM7	I wish the story would have had more depth and feelings, more details I don't know. I was a pretty story may be too short.	2
9690	AUO61MZVSR65X	from the first page i was turned off. would not recommend or read another book by author. the plot was very poor	0
9691	A26DSOSC6IY5IP	I enjoy reading books where the characters are connected to another book.  Jenn gives the big girls some love too.	2
9692	AVVIWI3GVENE3	Not written very well and predicable. Really lacking in details and emotion. I was pretty bored after just a couple of chapters.	1
9693	AT4EF6GQ3T0Q5	I just could not get into the characters.  I had a hard time wanting to continue reading the story past the first few chapters.	2
9694	A20MLP027RDS1T	this book was okay,but a little long winded for me.Though once i really got past some of the frustration,it was hard to put down	2
9695	A174GVGDK161RS	I expected a better ending. Probably happy ever after. Why not end it on a happy note. In s read of up in air.	2
9696	A2T66238EQXWKR	This book is a ok book. I wish it was longer and more reading in it. I will look for more books from this author may be.	2
9697	AY952C463O3U0	I found the guide to be helpful and useful for authors who may not want to use Smashwords. Much of the content can be used independently of Smashwords.	2
9698	A19HNPJ4TP9FWR	"Pure trash, very nasty language.  It turns my stomach to read such trash.  Please consider removing it from the ""free"" book list."	0
9699	A2BWXAS3O5IX94	Interesting way for an octogenarian looking for entertainment. Enjoyed this book.  Characters are realistic. Loved Myrtle attitude.  Wool look for more with this character.	2
9700	AUO23N5SQWOVE	When I read a book the first thing is that the story has got to grab me from the beginning and I am sorry to say this did not	1
9701	A2HSSP1F55VWU9	Was not very interesting to me I lost the will to read this book. So I gave up on it.	1
9702	A3QDFKNPPE8CHI	Maybe ok for the younger set but found it just too much hype and impossible situations to make it enjoyable to keep reading	0
9703	A1TBQ5SA7FSLCJ	Its okay just not what I was hoping it would be. Story line could have been a lot better. I just wont be buying from Neneh Gordon again	2
9704	AKW6FP6SIT4KL	It was entertaining and insightful, but not really my normal read. I did finish it though. If I had truly disliked it I wouldn't have done that.	2
9705	A18MUN2P6JQ15D	Love the stories of Phoenix. This particular one was just a teaser and a weak one at best. Not engaging enough.	2
9706	A287I3KMGD0NQ	As with the other craft books I have gotten, some of the patterns an / or instructions are incomplete.	2
9707	A3GBZ7SNI017AZ	It was not interesting enough to keep me from deleting it from my Kindle.  It may have ended well but I will never know and would not recommend purchasing it.	1
9708	A30CP62QUWE4VF	This was a very short story.it could have been longer. I do recommend it if you have thirty minutes to spare	2
9709	AGORW02J2U6ON	This was just plain hot.It also enjoyed the fact that it had an actual plot and even character development.Pretty smutty--not gonna lie...	2
9710	A2K7H6OEXM8NJV	Short story, very unrealistic. If I could I would ask for my time back. Good writing skills, but the story doesn't capture or take you into reading land.	0
9711	A321G7GC36M1V6	Short story repetitive interesting...found it was done as soon as my interest peaked...would make a good novel if idea was expanded.	2
9712	A242RIARZU44TF	this book stunk. it dragged on and on. I was bored after chapter one. won't read from this author again. it was free.	0
9713	APN3BY784NWEW	Interesting story line. Microbial time line with inconsistencies ie.  indoor plumbing. Major part of story is disconnected dreams.  Foul language, rape, murder, many loose ends.	0
9714	A3L6QBB9CVFH7F	Very well written with likeable charecters but ended too quick! Could of had more scams and more love scenes with Yandi	2
9715	A12NXW834VDTJP	Won't even start this book... Will contact Amazon tomorrow to learn how to delete...UGH!!! Need better rating system for those of us that don't like this type of book.	0
9716	A29QBZJ00B5N2I	fun  and easy read. You where entertained but knew the outcome easely. When you want to read a book and not much to think about this one is for you	2
9717	A3JF4OEH1IDS2N	Very good book just really really short. I really couldn't figure out the point of this book. But was a cute read.	2
9718	A3J4OV5BQ4XTL6	Not my cup of tea. Didn't realize I read part 2 first. Won't do part 1. Too hard for me to like this couple.	1
9719	A23MMF3NZPU8WF	Quick, short read. I was cheering for Delilah, hoping she find herself as well as finding some happiness. Didn't realize that this book left u hanging until the next one.	2
9720	A2OAY1UFN99HSX	I would not recommend this book to any one. i font understand why they have excerpts. why not have your own work	0
9721	A2LE4KMXK9O8OW	Spell check required...had a nice twist to the story.  Tom was really cold hearted I guess there are people like his character in the world...they are in the news everyday.	2
9722	A38DAR1RRA512S	I liked the book. Not quite as much as the others but I still would read it again. Anxious to read the last one.	2
9723	A12993071VTG5G	Again this was too much for me, I want some romance in a book and this didn't have what I was looking for. The erotic part was odd	1
9724	A39X0IDEP1273B	Wouldn't read this again...wouldn't have finished it but it was only 120 pages. Felt like this would have been better as a teen read	2
9725	A3205WZF5GEDX6	While I dislike short stories, I did find this one kind of cute.  Interesting way to make a happy ending happen.	2
9726	A36AUTZ88E7V0F	This book was simply not that funny, but fortunately, most are very short jokes, so you won't waste much time on them.	0
9727	A2LSJ7U1GA1LXO	The first one disintegrated, Kindle send me another one hope this one stays intact. It happens the same with the one my wife has	2
9728	A30CP62QUWE4VF	The story was good but too short. It was a short read. She could have gone into the family dynamics and resolved it.	2
9729	A30IBYUSXSBQZF	Characters were sad and a little depressing. Plot was OK not exceptional. I can recommend it for the price. It is a fast read.	2
9730	A2BM6W65ZWEJ71	It wasn't bad but it seems that the beginning of the book felt like the middle of the book. Their relationship didn't seem realistic enough.	2
9731	A3NOEGDSV73K7M	Just not my cup of tea. A girl who is a cat and two bi-sexual guys, just a little too much for me	2
9732	A19R60KZEC938	The book is OK. If you are new at gardening you will like this book, also you don't want it if you have a black & white kindle only.	2
9733	A194QQWX8BNN14	Only 20 count which works will for travel. Large sheets, works will. Cost is a bit on the high side.	2
9734	A1GP7RVHHI5GOP	I liked the book but not as much as the others. It's still a good read. It still has it's hot moments but Natalie seem to emotional in this book.	2
9735	A2Y2HURKWJWU0D	The Ugly Duckling is a classic and is a good children's story to have. I especially like that it is now offered on Kindle products.	2
9736	A1HRONZKI7TAKF	The story was okay. Not the best book.	2
9737	A18MTONR63P37N	I am glad that this book was free. the book only counted to 5 cows, as in 1,2,3,4,5. that's it. way to short, at least count up to 10 cows.	1
9738	A1MFUAAGOS2KH3	this story plot line is a little mess up and to short but a good enough book to read if your just reading to eat up time.	0
9739	AIW2HFOU89YJ0	this was too much I purchased by accident & kept it not impressed at all should of returned i did not like it at all. Just sex no story line	0
9740	A36PZNHTJG77XU	This book is not historically accurate, and is distorted from scripture. In fact, I fear it's rank heresy. Don't waste your tie or money.	1
9741	A2N8XI9PTDAC3K	This book was worth reading. It's short, but it's good. The characters are well developed and the story is interesting.	2
9742	A3PYFU2LKOWU25	"Very short, unsatisfying because there was wasn't time for much of a storyline.  Very disappointing.  I would not recommend this ""book""."	2
9743	A2FI7BGJVW1XEG	this was a good story but to short. just when I started to go for ad venture it was over.	2
9744	A1YMJ94UVX0OMM	Good but not long enough it was a lovely love story but the ending came too soon would read it again	2
9745	A3988SMZH29ESG	This book does not have an index or table of contents so I can move quickly from one reference to another.  It does not meet my expectations.	2
9746	A7Q4OHCC8DSFV	How difficult is it to give your leading man a different name in each book you write.....unless it is a series.  This fact made this book very confusing for me.	1
9747	A19TJVBZMM5PZ2	This had a disappointing ending... A HEA but abrupt end. ESP after the characters were decently written. Serious issues paragraphs notations.	2
9748	AOA3RU02KZUZR	It's a ok book.  Writing too stilted like he's not comfortable with writing.  Did enjoy the book & read more	2
9749	ATN68U6YEIW4W	An easy read, and rather predictable....Author is average in presenting, making it gushy at times which can become boring and easy to put down.	2
9750	A3QJY01AFZXROT	Even though this was a brief story, I was able to enjoy it enough to consider purchasing the others to see how it will unravel.	2
9751	AAWTV0UYDW3ZI	Cute and quite entertaining for those of us who have cats or just like cats.  So many photos remind us of our own cats.	2
9752	A2AC0R7G71RP5C	I love Jennifer's books. I this is a ok series, but too short & unbelievable. Who falls in love in one hot steamy night ?	2
9753	AQZ64R6S3R1VF	I had trouble finishing this book. I simply couldn't become engaged with the story. The story just seemed to drag on endlessly.	1
9754	A3OC1P26505FV	just couldn't get into it&#8230;  It's me, not you&#8230;  maybe I'll get back to it..	1
9755	A3TW49BUOSO1AC	I have nit read LL OF THEM YET AS I WAS A BIT TIRED OF THE STORIEA.  i FOUND THEM  a bit contrived.	2
9756	A12IDDG3QN2M92	Well done. There is always something a miss with a book like this, but it was very well done. Keep it clean!	2
9757	A12PR5SUS3MAWC	Author had a lot of humor and used  good descriptive details.  Storyline was too fast paced to make the relationship believeable.	1
9758	A31MOTCE0X4F1C	this book was horrible as the plot and characters were hard to get attached to or care what happened to them.	0
9759	A9HLNEEUFOBLD	A quick romantic read with enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested. A good leisurely book to enjoy	2
9760	A3F7PTSCTAVOQL	Not for anyone looking for substance in their books.  WAY to gross to read.  Too much porn and little to keep the reader intrigued.	0
9761	AZIUHUK8HYJ5M	Sometimes betrayal can be good, but love can determine if you can trust that person again. Great story line, not everything stays in the past.	2
9762	A10CM9U54AET1Z	Some of the stories were a little hard to follow when compared to the genius of 50 SOG. I expected better.	2
9763	AJL59IEBNETQ8	I have read all the books in this series. Not as good as some of the other books.I will still read more from this author.	2
9764	A2OZMU918SZH2A	I found this book very hard to read. For me it did not keep my attention long enough to read it very quickly.	1
9765	A31X0GK7XMM59F	My kindle died before I got to read this one.  Hopefully I will get another one soon. No it wasn't the batery.	2
9766	A2LHRR5GXNKP0D	This is an interesting exercise in short story form.  The main character is well thought out, and the story has a twist.	2
9767	A1DSFKDPKDXAXJ	BB Book club: Thugettes was very entertaining. And it definitely had some surprises in this book. Highly anticipating the sequel to this book.	2
9768	A1BPX78KXC6G29	It wasn't that good bcuz I really couldn't get in to it tho bcuz of all the stuff going on	2
9769	A2TWJ5FG5MEE9E	okay read it tend to drag some so much so that I became irritated at times.  But it was okay.  Not a keeper this time	2
9770	A3CDYLT8SSCB4L	Good enough short story. Actually didn't have a clue about the ending, so it was all a good read. Liked it.	2
9771	A3DZFG3K1GYHCJ	Some of these were excellent, some okay, and one I don't think I even finished.  It was a little erotic for me, not terrible, just not interesting to me.	2
9772	A32JU5XVKSLYDX	Too boring. Couldn't finish. I felt like I was on the outside of an inside joke or story. Many phrases I couldn't relate to.	0
9773	APH9I3BH2F9BA	thoroughly bored with the romance part, didn't see the need to include it.  Don't know why I read it to the end, mainly because I hate not finishing a book.	1
9774	A27OJ3KYKCPZF8	Not as exciting as the other books. I think considering this is a novella, I think the characters took too long working through the grief.	2
9775	A1IV5ISF5OKZ1A	I tried to understand material in this free book - but found it only slightly interesting since I'm not up to current technology.	1
9776	APJX6M494VYMB	Don't read this if you have qualms about family hooking up.  The premise was good but it kind of got uncomfortable as the story moved on.	2
9777	AYRFVJTE46BMZ	Good book went way to quick. Will be interested in the sequels.Have to get my other half reading to read them	2
9778	APT76ENH025BJ	This is a very dark story, and even though the message is clear it is very disturbing	1
9779	AYVJY4Z9CYQWU	A very fast-paced exciting thriller with a plot that makes it hard to suspend disbelief but keeps you reading anyway.	2
9780	A30K9MEPFESK61	I didn't read this but it's on my list as a book to rate so I'm giving it a 3 just to get it off my list. :/	2
9781	A4CEB14NMETWA	There were a few items that I bookmarked to try with my kids, but nothing more than the stuff you can find on-line just by doing a quick search.	2
9782	A1GQEH3S58URDX	Shorter story than a normal book, but a good story. Several heart stopping moments. It was a good read and I look forward to read more books by Anne.	1
9783	A12Q4IYZ0HOB0E	Interesting for the historic value- not really a story, rather an accounting of the events. Interesting biographical  information in the 1st person.	2
9784	A2X0710E6FHAOP	I guess I don't want to waste time reading just the sampler.  Once I start reading something, I want to finish it.	2
9785	A1DXOM1XDV0D0Q	This book did. not hold my interest. The book is not. a complete book. I don't like to buy series books. And will not buy the rest.  The story.was.not believable..	1
9786	AZPNGUGH55MTO	When a large sphere appears in New York City, all manner of agencies become involved in trying to learn it's secret.Fairly interesting. An ok read.	2
9787	AZYERRDY2VW61	This is short stores.first one good butcut story  too soon.the other two were boring not very good plot .I don't like this book .	0
9788	AC99B74ER03EY	This book was grammatically sound, of decent length but overly concerned with all things anal.  This was more of a BDSM text than an age play one.	1
9789	A194CS65LTOBUK	This book was well written and could be a stand alone. It has a good balance of action and romance.	2
9790	A1XARHZT4E4WAX	Stories were too short.  Disappointing.  But I should have known so can't blame anyone but myself.  Love Amish  stories but want them to be novels.	2
9791	AGCUSTPYL5MW2	That was like sex without an orgasm. It built up to what should have been a wonderful crescendo, but then fell flat on its face. What a disappointment.	1
9792	AWPQU0KEDIH7H	Liked the characters.  Good story line. Got hooked and couldn't put it down. Think I'll like next story in this series too.	1
9793	A23EESGR3Y3630	A cute love story. It was enjoyable to read. I recommend it! You won't be disappointed. It's a quick read, with a happy ending	2
9794	A3DQU9H0AN61Q6	I enjoyed this book but it really is quite a work of fiction still it is interesting enough to enjoy reading	2
9795	A2LQJIM2H35MHR	I do not like coconut.  Almost ever recipe has coconut in it.I am looking for healthy recipes for diabetes and gluten free butthis book did not have it.	2
9796	A2IIU6C3QVYFCC	There are some recipes that really should have &#34;use by&#34; recommendations, otherwise there are some good ideas, some not so much.	2
9797	A3SBF573086CJQ	This is a novelette, very short, and it does not build the characters or suspense because of story length. It is worth reading, but it leaves you feeling &#34;half full.&#34;	2
9798	A3BC4Y1076DX58	This was an all right book. Some if the information was repetitive. They threw in a couple of advertisements for other books as well.	0
9799	A1A3KHD9TVCIXH	I live in the middle of no where and some of the ingredients I couldn't find but they were easily subed for something eles.	2
9800	A2TRNSQ3UD2ZT6	Just not my kind of book - I lost interest in it about a third of the way into it.Pamela	1
9801	ASA5RSXOAVT12	Nothing spectacular; a decent short story but not necessarily historically accurate. A quick lunch time read that got me away from the chaos of school.	2
9802	A1K1XTR5HH4AQH	I couldn't even finish the first one, so I didn't even waste my time reading this one. I just deleted it with the first.	0
9803	AHTSM39PWK26S	I haven't read this yet, it was free and I got it. It may be a while before I get to it.	2
9804	A1DEHOTA3SSWZ0	Not much to say about this one. It was way too short for my liking. If it was longer , I would of gave it more stars.	1
9805	ADB1YD77JS7NM	"I love all these ""Mail order bride"" books. I liked the story but wish that it was a little longer. I look forward to the next book."	2
9806	A5NZUR5JV9MQB	Badly written. Poor story line. More detail is needed and better editing before this story will be worth ten minutes of your time.	0
9807	A35G33UL9Y0PCY	I have approximately 2200 paranormal books and e-books.  It's difficult to find entertaining material.  I found this book to be worth reading	2
9808	A11GG3W3BWP5IT	Everyone else must have read something else. I didn't get this. I didn't get the appeal to this. Probably just not my thing.	2
9809	A3KFQOVEUJZ0VQ	The writing was well done, story drug me in...but the ending....left me severely unsatisfied...like half the book wasn't there.  Unfinished, incomplete. :/	2
9810	A1PRXYVNVRA9ER	Overall a good read for free book. Not big on sleeping with the babysitter but it turns out ok in the end.	2
9811	AGJNYM44YLBLK	I may never buy eggs  again. Back to planning my garden, and maybe investing in some chickens.  I will try harder to read some of those labels	2
9812	A2ENLPQ581HL8E	The plot and the writing were amateurish, and I couldn't get through the second chapter.  Fortunately, I lost nothing on the deal, so no harm, no foul.	0
9813	A2TYBZYW5G3SK1	Way to much language, the author needs to increase her vocabulary, way to much use of the F work.  I don't really recommend this book.	2
9814	A3HNY4UNY8AGXV	I don't think this book was written by a native English speaker, but it did succeed in getting me interested in finding out more about coconut oil and its uses.	1
9815	A3B8NBK1HF953R	It was ok but again not much to this book. It just didn't do it for me. Very short and sweet.	1
9816	A2SAU6PP9IX6SO	It was very interesting - didn't have politics of twenty first century.  Good novel - enjoyed very much.  Thanks, L-3	2
9817	AIIKD5LR431DH	Very easy to get inside these characters minds and hearts. I would recommend for a rainy afternoon read.  Warm and quirky.	2
9818	A1RXUREZ5EDF7R	I skipped many pages because it gets boring. It was just ok.I think there is too much sex. I'd say 2.5.	1
9819	A1DL4CWZNPJQCY	Still was pretty good for a little book. Not much to say but if you're a fast reader it's kinda cute.	2
9820	A1YJJ759MB2PDW	Not quite what I expected.  Hmmmmmmmm.  Something was missing.  Although the book demonstrated what goes around, comes around so Karma is a Bytch but it failed to keep me interested.	2
9821	A2HSEMKUX5KAX6	Simple and cute way to get kids to play outside and compare things animals do verses humans. My 7 year old son thought it was great.	2
9822	ASYJN406ILZ96	This was a great life freebie. Enjoyed reading, some parts were a bit rushed & interrupted the flow of the book but all in all it was a good book	2
9823	AMQJLQAXXJ3WB	I really didn't,t think it was up to par with his other books that I,ve read.  it was way too short.	2
9824	A1UAR39AY3EFVQ	This is an informational book.  I could only read it parts at a time because the information was very strong.  It is exactly what the title states it is.	2
9825	AO596BLAHJVBQ	Again I am researching this subject and found this one entertaining and with something I could actually incorporate  into a real life scene.	2
9826	A718B8B0K971D	Fun book but pretty fluff.  Decent character development but a bit of a predictable story line that was a bit of a stretch to believe.	2
9827	A2W5B60CW0RUHU	I found it somewhat boring but have to admit they were definitely blessed with God's care during their journey!  The End	2
9828	A3CNWYFJPBXT2N	It was a confusing  storyTo much violence in itTo many unanswered questionsThere was no sense to it	2
9829	A3JE2DECQVIH3Y	It was hard for me to get into this book, will not read any more, might try other stuff by this author	2
9830	A3UA57P7BEUIN7	Not much of a mystery. The build up was okay a bit long winded the characters not really believable.  But it filled up the time before sleep easily and gently.	2
9831	A12YXCKFQZVYJX	This book was too political for me. I only got too chapter 3 then the politics started I had enough on T.V.	2
9832	A262S5EQUTER4P	I thought it was going to be good when I bought it,turns out I was only disappointed. Not very good.	0
9833	A235G4PIASZW7A	Quick read.	2
9834	A3FQXWPHBIYNK4	"[...]With a ""heroine"" falling into the TSTB category and an abusive, controlling ""hero"" the story is not only poorly imagined but the characters are not even realistic or consistent."	1
9835	A3FLY9H5JTO3SF	There's nothing extraordinary about it.  It's the usual &#34;over the top sex&#34; but no real substance to it, and no real plot.	2
9836	ABVXY3D3CCY1Q	I liked this book, but I thought it was to short. I would have like to read about farther into their future. it was a good quick read.	2
9837	A1SDTLCBN2GZMU	i chose this rating because i went through it and was ok to work with just a little hard to look at the kindle and do the excercises	2
9838	A2887V5VWH7C67	I ''ve enjoyed the series of the Walker brothers. This last installment would be better all in one volume. JennieB	1
9839	A2VZCC8Z6XOZCL	Sadly this historical romance was just plain boring. The writing was simply not good enough to make the story interesting.	0
9840	A2BGKGUI30NP86	Only part of the book. Typical Ludlum though. Really good. Now to hope my library has it as I don't have the money to buy it.	2
9841	A2CYUEFLYG72CW	Anna writes an interesting story about a young women's life in the early 1900's.  She vividly describes the low esteem many men had for women.	2
9842	AMS6J2UF82NN2	Fiercely loyal, this family will keep you entertained as they battle the Blues and gangs  after the end of the world.	2
9843	APL4Y26X4LHA8	I believe this book contains stories for different people of varying levels of faith. They weren't as impacting as I'd expected but sufficient at expressing gratitude.	2
9844	ATX2V4OQWV86W	It was a little too bloody for me. I wasn't happy with the main character he was way out there	2
9845	A3NVWXNC3A8IPA	I wish I could get my money back.  Please just let this book die...don't even write another book on the subject....I'm deleting it from my Kindle Cloud....TERRIBLE	0
9846	A3OSHA5PBP5PJ0	a ill disappointed in how this book ends but at least it's over, don't know if I will continue with what's next that ties in with this series	2
9847	AQWKSTEDCG34J	I really wanted to like this book but just didnt at all im sorry..  I was skipping scenes just to see would it improve but sadly no..	0
9848	AFMMHENVC60TQ	I enjoyed the storyline and I'm always a sucker for happy ending. Wish it was a little longer but not a bad read.	2
9849	A2D5LUDDXES86I	Ok was lost a little in the beginning but it got better as I progressed. I have read a lot worse books.	2
9850	AHZU13893F56L	A novel more for teenagers not a mature adult.  I will not purchase another book in this series. I am sure high school students would enjoy the series.	1
9851	A36XU39R2X06PX	Rate it a 3.5 star, loved the storyline but all three books could have been one book b/c it was to short for me.	2
9852	A2C967K424J0JH	From the beginning the story was confusing and the character's not believable. For a short story to much was left out making you guess as to what is going on.	0
9853	A2UKPCMKY94KPQ	Entertaining paranormal romance with like able main characters.  The author's take on vampires has an interesting twist.  I will definitely try another.	2
9854	A1123DWCIXKG1M	Couldn't get past the first few pages. Really not well-written in my opinion. I can't stand poor writing. Sorry. Eli.	0
9855	A21K9CF22PAGL5	I couldn't get into this book enough to finish reading it.  So I really can't rate it properly.  It didn't hold my interest.	1
9856	A2CBYN2ZGN5TPK	This was a good read. It was nice how the hero and heroine were instantly drawn to each others as if their souls were waiting for the union.	2
9857	A2P4S77XQ14KMA	nothing really new...seriously I don't have much more to say about this product so I'm just filling up space....ugh please	2
9858	A12JXV3KP9E5ET	Interesting and funny. If I had not already read the book written before this one I would have been confused with who was married to who.	2
9859	APFHNZ5XXQ87R	It was an okay read for me, It had pieces of &#34;Starla&#34; in it.Otherwise just okay.Nothing to write home about!	2
9860	AIW9D26MST3KJ	Tense shifts are distracting, still timing issues and believability problems with some of the plot points.  Otherwise well written and still intriguing, will be checking out the next installment.	2
9861	A31PFO2M57JFMQ	This super short read explains & connects the relationships of the characters from &#34;Tempted&#34; and &#34;Naked&#34; very well. Only 68 pages	2
9862	A241MV6TK1957R	Usually love Jasper T Scott.  This series though was hard to get into and have not finished it.	2
9863	A2R55EE2HMCSBD	I liked this book, although for me the characters could have been defined even better.. perhaps a little more time spent on the supporting characters would be better for me.	2
9864	A3AAMMQR4WIDI5	Based on the first half of the book, I would have given this 4 stars, but I just plain didn't enjoy the second half.	2
9865	A2UX1QYTF609V	I really enjoyed all her other books but this one was too predictable, short, and not nearly as entertaining as her others.	0
9866	A2QUYDR8PCEE79	This was a short hot read. I was really liking how sexy erotic it was. I was enjoying the characters. How ever I did not enjoy the ending.	2
9867	A1PT9PWILLHGAA	I just couldn't get into this one. The business with the goat - no Regency home would allow that.The characters difficult to like.	1
9868	A3FVFH6SJQ151B	enjoyable short novella - the continuation of Isaac's rehab after the shooting covering approx 15 months, and a new addition to the Lunden family	2
9869	A2VLJI0BOD5ROO	odd. kind of predictable. have to wonder tho with the ending being the way it is, what are the penalties for being late?	2
9870	AK6QV6O8CR00X	This very very short story was better done in an old Twilight Zone.  Not sure about all the 4 and 5 star reviews. Very short, very obvious, very done before.	1
9871	A3IJJTEI36PZ8R	I had high hopes for this story but it was flat.  I read all three books hoping it would get better but it never did.	1
9872	A3BTYCOT0H64ZW	Well written.  Sound methods to help relieve stress.  Will have to start slow with the meditation.  First need to not eat lunch at desk.	2
9873	A39RTYNKU66J8G	The Bride and the Brute was a good book, but way to short. I was looking for more of the story.	2
9874	A206V4SI3ZF87H	This book felt like an afterthought.  I much preferred some of the other books that took place in the series.	1
9875	A1XSJ2NV7T0LK9	This was a good story, but all the while I was waiting for a climax but instead got a continued next book.Not bad, but a bit anti climax	2
9876	A3SC4JLAR4IZWL	More of a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am kind of story than anything else. Wasn't all that impressed. Nice lil twist at the end	2
9877	A1M5DKB6IOESVU	"The original story was great, so I don't understand why we needed this short story. It was just ""ok"" for me."	2
9878	A25XPYSOFMWWU2	Certainly not based on a true story but did hold my interest. It was so easy to visualize the outrageous images. No movie can tell this tale.	2
9879	ABX8KP720435P	i have a feeling this is the author's first book and i congratulate her on that. But the story just felt a little juvenile and it wasn't an easy read.	1
9880	A1L0VWUDDEFTPD	This story line just didn't do it for me.  I was disappointed in the time I spent reading it, just maybe the wrong time for me.	1
9881	A1I7O4XRG3QK1A	To short when you get into it it's over. it should have been longer but what I did read was ok.	1
9882	A1XQ8M8ZEIAASX	The story is kinda obvious after the first encounter.The ending, while a bit surprising, is not 'satisfying'.Shouldn't the poor, abused main character get a little relief??	2
9883	A3HC8GP7T5R98Q	IT WAS A LIGHT ROMANCE BUT HAD A LITTLE BIT OF ACTION TO MAKE IT A REASONABLE READTHE CHARACTERS WERE VERY GOOD	2
9884	A1FC6HS3ZG9MXF	This is a short simple book.  The start and finish is odd and annoying.  The romance is completely missing.  I found the book lacking and glad it was free.	2
9885	A1K6HATE4C4G1R	Was cute. Wish they would have told us more of what happened to the rest of them. Like what happened with the ranch and Luke and so on	2
9886	A3OYF7G1T8ES30	Don't remember much abouth this book. Read it a while back. I just remember I liked it ok, but not loved	2
9887	ATXA15S9LABU9	The book is well written but the subject matter is a little far fetched. That said the book did hold you in suspense.	2
9888	A3D01CE6G4VKBA	It wasn't badly written, but it's not my cup of tea.  If you like science fiction, it's worth a try.	2
9889	A3ES0XIED7769J	Reminded me of the married lady steering a young man the wrong way. Some people will look at her the wrong way.	2
9890	A2J36T6J3GWT6O	This was a good Holiday read.  It was a second chance love story!!!!  I think this is worth reading if you are looking for a quick holiday read.	2
9891	A1SVVOKIP0TQ0Z	I didn't dislike the story, the writing was good. But there was more family drama than mystery. It wasn't bad, just not great.	2
9892	AA8EC4GQ9OECB	No contexts to these stories, no romance, not erotic, more creepy than anything else and kinda sad and pathetic honestly.	0
9893	A24BB7ZQSVFD92	Sorry, but I really didn't' enjoy this very much. It might be OK for some people, but it just wasn't' for me.	1
9894	A1LPXYVRUCXWEQ	This was a great book,but the ending was too short.  They don't have a long romance, it's like the last three pages.  However, the rest of the book was good.	2
9895	A364I0S17AS36R	I was expecting more of a story like fables. My five year old son didn't like them either. overall we were just disappointed	1
9896	A1Z1VYZH6IKCR4	To me this trilogy was not as good as some of her other boxed set.  They were like short stories, I needed a little more.	2
9897	A237RYD4WEQ0L2	It was a quick and easy read (short story) which held my attention looking forward to reading more of this author work!	2
9898	ADEJJ4NNUMDFZ	it is okay ....ok. better than ok.....so wouldn't recommended it unless ur really sexual and dirty. this is horible..omg... well &lt;: pretty good.. I'm pleased	2
9899	A2HSAKHC3IBRE6	But I can't remember anything about it... which says something! It must not have been terrible, but it was obviously not memorable.	2
9900	A1AO4DLSLMCA0	The concept is good, but there's too much explanation of things that aren't really necessary. The emotions & feelings seem pretty flat too, based on what Eva is going through.	1
9901	A2FR7724R3ZM8U	A little slow..I normally read a book in a few days but this one took me longer.  Just couldn't get into it.	2
9902	A3FVAHYWXWHWG	&#34;Grandma, now let's check out the dinosaurs&#34;.  Grandma liked it 4 stars. The graphics were great!  The time with my grandson... Priceless!	2
9903	A2PANHB1OFF2EE	I have read better urban fiction...this book jumped from  one character's  story to another therefore making it hard to keep up with whats going on	2
9904	A17ETBG254GGV2	Romance novel (rippling muscles, meaningful glances, encounters in the tent, that sort of thing).  Won't read another.  But okay if you like to kill an afternoon with mind candy.	1
9905	A2SP0RDAEDCUEA	It is a well-written short story. It deals with grief in a variety of its guises. Certainly worth the read.	2
9906	A3361XGKYF17S3	Leaves me hanging. Are they together at the end. Not sure what happens. It would have been nice if it was longer.	2
9907	A3FOVQZB84AUID	did not give a close to story and left reader wondering what happened to characters.  need a sequel to this to get a closure.	1
9908	ATKUVPJEKZWKY	I hope it farts back on the author, come to think of it Karma should take care of this one.	0
9909	AYZ406MJ1VZ7W	I don't recall when this book was published, but I was disappointed that there weren't more new jokes.  Hopefully, there are some better joke books for sale.	1
9910	A387LUCMM44SXR	I just love fairy tales of any kind. I especially like that Grimm's fairy tales are not always happy  endings.	2
9911	A1935R37194ZGH	writing was good but story had no real conclusion.  Glad it was so cheap. I would not recommend it to anyone.	1
9912	A2QLSELS1RSDC1	The book did not explain enough for me.  I would have liked more about the full armor of God.  It's not a book that I would read again.	2
9913	A2QGYMSY2RI47A	The book was good but not long enough. I would recommend it if you like short stories. It was a good story.	1
9914	A2R46O4JCSAQDL	Book did not hold my interest - perhaps it was too short - not sure - I don't think I am a short story person perhaps.	2
9915	A2S6K8IRG1F7AJ	I don't see how this story went along with the other two. This story introduced whole new characters that was not even mentioned in the previous books.	2
9916	A1G3XQ9MCU9KXU	this story is fine but i liked the other one better. I have read several books by Vivian Arend now and she's a pretty decent author.	2
9917	A372SLAISSEUXR	this part was ok i wanted luke to find love in nicole i didnt want it to end like that i hope its a part 4	2
9918	A3QNRKLE3DHLKX	I'm sorry but the book is far to short to do justice to the plot, for me it wasn't believable nor well written and not worth the effort	0
9919	A1P08DNDPU3RRW	Free great deal on the kindle	2
9920	A36AGGEU8X80X6	Kidnapped.  Sold. Raped.Details are minimum.Characters not developed.one could write a whole book out of this story starter.  only, I don't WANT to write.	0
9921	A3JGSODK9M86EN	She kills people for their blood, enjoys it, and makes choices based on visions she has without thinking it through. Very dark book.	1
9922	A34YQOB35ZRYRH	This is okay if you like mindless characters.  The author should have been more careful when writing so errors in grammar, punctuation, usage, and word choice might have been avoided.	2
9923	A178LDG5AE5OOZ	I didn't bother to finish the story. The characters were flat, one dimensional. The feelings were bland as were the details.  It read like a time line.	0
9924	AEU5Q3TMR1M1Q	Loved every minute I spent reading this book,it had a great plot and wonderful characters. I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves romance.	2
9925	A27Y93EEOUH0BF	This was a good story, but the end was a little rushed.  I enjoyed the characters.  It was great that they weren't the same as so many other books.	2
9926	AW28NRDZC7D38	It's a short little blurb that makes it through one orgasm and stops.  Pretty standard for gay erotica on the kindle.	2
9927	A221OLQ0JMCM7T	This was an average story with a predictable story line.  It was a fast read and kinda sweet but nothing special stood out in this book. .	2
9928	A1KRYEH6EDGQ6E	I was hoping the story would have been a weekend entertaiment.  I could not get passed the third paragraph due to the level of profanity.  Not worth it.	0
9929	A38WSP0W6XSC90	Book was good. Had me stuck. Wish it would of been longer. but well worth the read. Ready for part 2	2
9930	A3B7J7DCSXOE68	I liked the idea, but found it to fast and short. I wish it was a bit longer with more filler.	2
9931	A39JK9SMJ8W6J3	Enjoyed following all the characters through all three books.  It seemed like one never ending story.  Could have just made it one big story.	2
9932	A1VELNRW7IV33W	As a kid I loved these stories, but without good illustrations I'm afraid these stories just don't hold up well over time.Pass.	1
9933	A2EEW9NO04TCXJ	Okay book predictable began we'll then became disappointing needed to be fleshed out more, humor worked well, but actin at the end a little lame	2
9934	A2TQE2AF176XE7	my grandkids and i expected a little more, they just didn't get they were like sheep.  maybe need to get a herd	2
9935	ADXAE3UOGPUN4	Recipes involve too many ingredients and no simple dish. I feel people should know how to eat simple because too many ingredients means too much wastage.	2
9936	A1U3T0KVMKLY6T	Great book would highly recommend it. I will check into more books from this author. I love this type of book. I love romance novels.	2
9937	A32GCVUCYYORME	this was interesting. Very short story and finished  just all of a sudden. Good but short. This is shorter then any short story  I ahve read before.	2
9938	A10K4CN7CEA3K0	J. Lynn books are always enjoyable to read.  This is a  book with several stories in this just teasers not much to enjoy.	1
9939	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Read it a while ago.  Authors books all  have same themes.  Repetitive.	1
9940	A2WZDYXBK7SQIT	Humerous and fast paced. A little too brief for me. Everything that was here was very good. It's just that I would have liked more of everything.	2
9941	A19RNYNIUCH5J5	typical travelogue, some interesting things, some boring. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for this one. It looked interesting but didn't live up to my expectations	2
9942	A1PCLZ8TOJOZ6V	Good short erotica. Good storyline but wish the whole story was contained in one novel as opposed to being a novella. Still do try it.Lese Forbes	2
9943	AT19RMM9LM09O	It is ok. I would not give it to my grandchildren to learn by. It is confusing to read. But good for an adult.	2
9944	A1BUBUB84T9JU2	Some of the stories were good, but at least two is not to my liking. It is worth reading thou.	2
9945	A1JL9ZT8PL5J0Z	This information has been presented over and over. Wish there were something truly new in this book. Appreciate the effort.	2
9946	A12O37OAS83ILY	I found the book very choppy and very had to get into.  The characters weren't intoduced well, and the back story nonexisitant,	1
9947	A197W8MNF706HT	But not horrible either. Decent story with a twist I didn't see coming. There was plenty of throw me against the tree sex too.	2
9948	A372MDSZU8MYQK	Another ho-hum fantasy of sorority life.  It may or may not be realistic (I've never belonged to a sorority!), but the &#34;plot&#34; is trite.  I've read better porn than this.	0
9949	A2MBL4TDKKQP82	Guilt, sex, sex, sex, lust, guilt, blackmail, murder, sex, sex, sex, oh and I can't forget sex...THE ENDNot worth the money I didn't spend. (it was free)	1
9950	A313ZBNXL4R32V	first the title is hilarious. I must admit that I am enjoying the Shifters Inc series. can't wait for the next installment.	2
9951	A2QV424NAKZCZZ	A good story line. I would have liked an epilogue to tell me what happened to Samantha and the sergeant.	2
9952	AU98X34Z5INZI	I wasn't much impressed with this story. The concept was hard for me to get any interest in. A camel is pretty much out of my idea of a pet.	2
9953	A2LFWDAWORQWHL	Some books had strong characters and some had good plots but neither in the same book. It was most just sex	2
9954	A1VDL9KMDQ0558	This three part series was a quick read. Different from the other books by her. Still a good  story line.	2
9955	ALUNU4DRE0OZH	I found this slightly interesting. Not great.Unfortunately 13 more words are required before I can hit the submit button.	2
9956	A2Q95CRI8CONPE	Not to bad for a free read. It was short and not too much to it. Maybe give it a try since its free...	1
9957	AH1FE0H8VVV6E	this was a cute fast story. some of the details were a little rushed and unbelievable but was clean cute and enjoyable.	2
9958	A3LLMXR3QJR60T	I'm sorry but I couldn't get pass the first few pages.  It may get better only I did not feel it would get any better.  Sorry	0
9959	A2XZUTLKSCXS1A	The typical love story of kids that grew up together, separated, then reunite as adults. It was predictable but pleasant.	2
9960	AKD3H4TY6C8D0	This was a long drawn out affair which finally ended up being about the temperance movement. Not very good but some might like it	1
9961	A3JB1KHA2QON2G	Read the whole series and found them good to begin with but a little predictable by the end of the series.	2
9962	A1ATF939HU6RIO	I love this author but this book lost my interest in the middle. I finished it and look forward to the next and last book in this series.	1
9963	A30HX9CFUECYL2	Not my favorite book. If you want to read about sex without a real story this is it. Nothing happen other than sex.Not a good read.	0
9964	A3TVFCBJYJ1RK4	This book is designed for people who really have never used a weight loss book before.  It has good points to follow.	2
9965	A2WI3SHX85WB9O	"As always, Zane's writing was spectacular.  However, what was the point of this story?  Is there more coming?  I love Zane, but ""I'll Be Home..."" left me confused."	2
9966	ADKIWW3EK3GWT	It was a decent addition to the series it just lacked the suspense and ompf that the others did. I really did like Deck though.	2
9967	A1QCKGJK3986BE	It was ok, I wanted more. It was heading in the tight direction then it just ended. I may read or. 2.	1
9968	AVJUQJ466NEHM	Really hoping the main character, Hess, is over her constant moaning about poor me. Really made the book tedious. We will see if I keep reading this series.	2
9969	AFJ9VM9YIFH18	Just could not get into the style or plot. Sorry. The tale was a bit too dark and heavy for me, but not everybody likes the same books.	2
9970	A1DVNLVD9URX7G	It was good until the ending.  There was no real hint that Reagan was from the future.  Did not like the ending.  It was good up until the.	2
9971	A1W15QG2GJCX1B	I wouldn't call it original. I have read several books with similarities. However, it was a okay read. It didn't put me to sleep.	2
9972	A2M648QP6BSN06	It seemed that the same story line was repeated over and over.  Once you were through the first couple of chapters, you were pretty much through the book.	0
9973	A46YB9ILRNKEW	Allison Brennan is great. I try to purchase everything that she writes. However, I was disappointed that this book was so short.	2
9974	A24OB0Y1OJ3A03	Once again, a beautiful story made cheap by the descriptive sex. I would love to give the book more stars, but I just can't.	2
9975	A1IYUYNEQ7KQ9H	nothing really stood out from other fantasy novels I have read. no true up or down to owning this book	2
9976	A2YXCNR7RVYLH2	The story started out rather slowly. As it progressed it became a little better but I really have no interest in continuing on with the next book.	2
9977	A212QA30WPM5PC	Rather s strange and rambling story.  I would not read one like this again.  It wad very hard to follow.	2
9978	A3D0JCKUNVWJO4	"Worst of the worst ""books"". A blank paper is a better book than this. Please do not waste your money. Don't even download for free; complete waste of time."	0
9979	AK416MLKE1AH5	this book did not live up to my expectations based on the rest of the series and I am rethinking continuing with the series.	2
9980	A20R84B0V53LQ2	This was fun and enjoyable reading how Ms. McDaniel wove her story with such strong characters. Loved them. I hope she will continue to write more in the future.	2
9981	ARHYU0IMJFOS5	Simple, basic information. I wasn't impressed. I didn't learn anything new. I flipped through the book in about 5 minutes.	1
9982	A3EAM5E8X8IV0B	This was good reading for a short quick story. Not as historically in-depth as some of Mrs.Henley' s other books.	2
9983	A1OBAXP08HWLD8	Downloaded free for kindle but the patterns are not all that appealing. I'll be removing it from my device and don't highly recommend.	1
9984	A91VBX9EYKLMN	Ok I was just getting into the book and then it ended. I really hope book two is not like this one	1
9985	AJGRWKWZ8B18P	Not even a story. Don't even know where to start about this it begins and ends in 5 minutes. Well at least it was free.	0
9986	A1TVMRZSZPBBQT	Not much to it. Would not have finished it if I didn't feel that it is bad karma to do so.	2
9987	A3MOGV0QO66QZD	Liked the book!  Thought the love scenes were steamy.	2
9988	A3BPXMGIQGKYEG	Ok read but should have been listed as a short story. No damsel in distress, danger or rescue here. More of these would have made it a better read.	2
9989	A2GBOK8FWE4FY8	I would've liked the story to be a little longer but still a great story.I liked the entire storyI would recommend this book to everyone I know	2
9990	A3VR9NKJ6TTP5G	They were great but some were very unexpected. I don't really care for man on man action but to those who do those stories will quench your thirst.	2
9991	A1HRONZKI7TAKF	This last book was kind of weird	2
9992	A2AU74B72KU072	The story was very nice and sweet, but being a woman whom believes in sampling before the entree it wasn't quite for me.	2
9993	A2RPAEL5DWSJNV	Very small instalment compared to the rest of the books in the series. Expensive for the amount of content . 3/5 to tears no giggles I read the book	2
9994	A20R37WRPLUM1D	A bit choreographed at times, but still a good short read. A nice example of the unrequited high school crush, made believable by decent writing and story line.	2
9995	A1J9A0QQCV7RTK	Wild card is a fast read.  Once you pick it up just want to finish it asap.It is very light but enjoyable...	2
9996	A3ICJZI2KK6PQF	Spoiler Alert: this sounded to hard to believe. They went from kissing to going all the way in one session. Most girls wouldn't move this fast.	2
9997	A15NOKHCHKMFL4	I downloaded this eBook while free, but I found it to be an enjoyable read.  Look forward to reading more from the author.	2
9998	A3SI4OM80M92MP	So glad this was free because I would be mad if I had paid for it. It had great potential for a full length book though.	0
9999	A2G6TX0IFCMZF3	Not at all prepared, thought I was getting a novel, not short cop stories, even though they were good, just not was I was expecting.	2
10000	A1X5BB77ACKWJE	The first 3 stories were good the last 3 were alright, glad I had the chance to read them for one low price,	2
10001	A2YPE6PPSQ5NXK	Part two of Daniel and Harry's story started out very slow.Almost boring.But about half way it seems Ms. Kane woke up and BOY what an ending!	2
10002	A1FWPP7G6FST1B	This book is alright.  Same list of characters as Victorious Star, written by a different author.  I would recommend that book for reading.	1
10003	A3ATDMWWSC89LV	ALL OVER YOU is an interesting story about young adults starting college and their adventures. Contains bad language, sex, romance and love.	2
10004	AWZ60T8B0ITAP	Maybe it's because I didn't read any of Eb MacLean before this one, but I was confused several times during the read.  Not sure I'll try any of the others.	2
10005	A29ILQHKEGK9XC	The end was too obvious about half way through the story.  Not to subtle.  Too much romance action going on for a war story.	2
10006	A36JELIH955MWD	my first question is way marry her when she was alreay like she was and expect her to change aftger i got over that it was an ok story line	2
10007	A242FL7IVV3C12	It was okay, but not much more. Disappointing given the high ratings and very positive reviews on Amazon. Far-fetched story line with a very predictable outcome.	2
10008	AXH7NGCC36XIR	I have a multitude of allergies so most of the recipes would not work for me, maybe just one or two.	2
10009	AT5ZKJOR4HUDJ	This is a terrible book a waste of money and time.therecseemed to be very littke plot and very un tealidtic.	0
10010	A1HBWSGJUKIG8R	A good quick read. I liked the characters and how the author set them up. I like the love they end up having for each other it's cute	2
10011	A2F43ZCDNT1FYF	I liked the story line but did not like the ending.  It should have been more in depth after the third book.	1
10012	A2K7H6OEXM8NJV	I'm not a fan of journal styled writing and this is no exception. The story could had been fun if done in a better style.	0
10013	A2IFNFGRWLZNX8	I much prefer the first book. This one did nothing for me. I bit boring, was happy when it ended. Nothing special to brag about.	1
10014	A1GA3TAZ9YSX5J	You won't put it down! Sa'id Salaam is a good writer. Love his work. Waiting for more to come.  Peace.	2
10015	A31GMWA73W17SP	Not the worst story I've ever read but also not close to the best story I've ever read. It was ok.	2
10016	AMD94KRA2PQC2	This is a good little read if you like erotica. Kinda wished it was longer. Looking forward to reading more from this author	2
10017	A1OAHQY4MBKZZV	This was a good book. Caitlin needed an attitude adjustment but other than that it was romantic and had a bit of humor!	2
10018	AHMRENOZ4ERLJ	Waiting for the next book. When does it come out? It didnt have much humour but it was a good read	2
10019	A3HXJ7TM71YMXN	was very interesting and the recipes I have tried were very good. It makes good sense to establish eating that way.	2
10020	A1IP8K5BLO6VWL	a few short stories that are a mild read for the most part. it was still enjoyable and it's a great book for night time reading to make you sleepy.	2
10021	ANYFFX3SIZ57U	A rather short story, but a nice one about a blended family and how they were able to make things work for everyone.	2
10022	AKBFI49QK96S5	The story itself was not that witty, the reason I gave it a 3 was the superb job the author did at mangling English so it made sense.	2
10023	A1YNMEW855P902	I started the book but could not finish it. Maybe if I kept reading it would get better but I didn't have the time.	1
10024	A2LBC1N643PAKO	This is a fun story  to read.  Goes easily and still has some mystery. Essie is a fun character and I will be like her when I'm 90.	1
10025	A1KQ2F0IUFCY9H	this is one of the worst books I have ever read. zero character development, grammar errors, punctuation errors and a stupid plot. don't bother!	0
10026	A1NDMPC1Y56X53	This book was ok as far as romance novels go.  They are always so predictable but the more the characters are expanded on the better the book will be.	2
10027	A4GO81BSRAXV2	The author gives some very sage advice.  Logical thinking and practical application of skills learned.  Practice makes knowledge.  A good read.	2
10028	A3IQ0P3M39IY8U	I liked the book and it's characters, but I'm not crazy about all the different POV's. I don't know why, really, but I just find it very distracting.	2
10029	AM60YDBNKTU18	i read most of this. i skipped one or two stories because i mostly read it at night. wonderful, prefer classics in paper	2
10030	A3GBLE8GFOJTPE	A little too predictable.  Nothing outstanding from most other books on the topic of summer attire.  But you can't win them all.	2
10031	A2AB67A0SMFX6T	I think this book have more potential,but it's a pleasure light history to read. I like the idea of the characters, just simple.	2
10032	A3EQ2OUNA4GW24	Very short story. It was ok.	1
10033	AQ1IEZHUJY8C0	Zac has submitted a useful  list of  basic essential items which can save our life in the first few days of a natural catastrophe	2
10034	A2G2AIPI6FJL2K	I liked that the H stuck to his gun and was serious about getting back with his wife.  Worth it.	2
10035	A13OGC4WSU6SJ2	This was a one-time cursory look.  If one is interested only in what is going onin Washington and what is dished to the regular press, this is good to read.	2
10036	A0229119WYOGTKRDOJCQ	Not sure if the entire book downloaded.  If indeed it did the few pages made available were a waste of time.	0
10037	A7V6CFV2SSYQS	Once I got into the book, I realized it was not my type so discontinued reading it.  Might be fine for others	1
10038	A1GP7RVHHI5GOP	A good easy enjoyable read. Good characters,and a decent plot. It's not cliffhanger but you do have to continue to the next book to get all the answers.	2
10039	A3UUN5NEZME5NV	I am not sure I can find twenty words to describe this book. It was so bad I couldn't even finish it.	0
10040	A2YJ8VP1SSHJ7	It was ok. Definitely have to read the rest to see how it ended for them. Always interesting to read about werewolf hierarchy.	2
10041	A38AV3CSWAC093	It was boring and tasteless. Another overly sexed light-skinned (because the author makes sure to inform you of that  in the synopsis.) hood-rat. Another CWE remake.	0
10042	A1SPKCPR0BAZMY	This is described as a &#34;whimsical story of unfettered sex&#34; but don't be fooled;  it's just really bad porn.  Don't bother	0
10043	AFFOJF0K98VU8	It's a good story about sticking up for someone less fortunate, but no romance. Some attraction was shown, but that's it. I like more romance in my stories.	2
10044	A1GEIKICM8V9JY	This short story focused on Jonah and his dreams and thoughts of Ella, sometimes weird. For such a short story (40 pages) there was not enough story for $2.99.	2
10045	A3B9N0SALCL9K4	Same old book trying to be like 50 shades.....	1
10046	A129F8KTMFD1PR	If you need a feel good book this,is,it.  It's a,quick read with a easy storyline to follow.  Good book overall.	2
10047	A317QDJ4KBVLON	didn't like the story line, or the characters were lined up or any of it. I thought there would be more.	0
10048	A31HOMGN89LURN	This book was no fun.  It was all angst and pain by the characters.  Not worth reading and very disappointing.	0
10049	A5TUQNTNCXTYA	The novel is rather predictable but the heroine is not.  She is a little outrageous. But the plot is interesting. Good beach reading.	2
10050	A1SPKCPR0BAZMY	The writing in this was terribly immature; but worse still was the story. Completely unbelievable characters and behaviour.  Couldn't finish it, which is rare for me	1
10051	A3V5YJJZI2G2NN	It is way to short and not really anything to read would not recommend this to anyone. No dept.  Could of been a good book if there was one	0
10052	A5ORNL5HK948T	I definitely GIVE THIS BOOK FIVE STARS.I literally couldn't put the book down.I read it in one day.I give it high praise.I highly recommend it to everyone.	0
10053	A1PQ1WONMEYM0X	I love the Jack Reacher series but this was too short to even register as a short story, felt more like a long chapter.	2
10054	AX1S72K94G44L	Just Disappointed in the Story - not Enough Detail. Too Short a Book - More Like Condensed Chapters from a Book.	1
10055	A3E6O0RMW0EDXQ	Not my type of murder mystery.  I could not read it all because the writer or person telling the story is deranged.	1
10056	A1K1B1I8ZE4J4	thought the book was just OK.  The premise was interesting but too much weeping and wailing.  Don't recommend getting it.	2
10057	A2BGKGUI30NP86	I don't like authors that don't do their research where weapons are involved. Glocks don't have a safety. Story has  no sense to it because of that stupid little error.	1
10058	A3LI194S8AIM03	Yes, he is a Alpha male, The sex is hot, The plot is a knock off of the Movie the Bodyguard, with a little vampire Heat thrown in.!	2
10059	A3I7JB3P0DSCZN	It's nice to see the other character's backgrounds but it's a really small book almost one third of it is chapters from the other books.	2
10060	A1WWR7O2RJROPX	I thought this book would have better recipes in it. None sound tastey when I read the the book. None the recipes inspired me to try them	2
10061	A38S02ZUL1BOUJ	This book was cute & it moved fast. The book was pretty good would recommend it if you are looking for a quick read	2
10062	A8NJVG0EIJDR1	This novel was good, but lacked the freshness of the first story.  I do recommend it and will purchase the sequel.	2
10063	AKV228JYIR82O	pretty far out plot but was a quick read and enjoyable enough plot that held your attention......think this is a series based on the lead character.	2
10064	A39RTYNKU66J8G	It took a while to catch my interest, but once caught it was a worthy read. I would recommend this to anyone who likes  romance, murder, and intrigue.	2
10065	A1T24CW443O0XE	This book held my interest in the beginning then it slowed down then picked up again. It was a bit long though.	2
10066	ASEC1V6JDIFS	This was the absolute worst book I have read in a long time!  Do not waste your money to buy it!	0
10067	AGOD2OPUPMQ0Q	This book was sweet, and a bit comfusing, but easy to read, Its like how could they be in forcloser, when they have been paying.	2
10068	A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2	this is ok. some of the stories are worth the read and some aren't. not bad for the cost, but not overwhelmed by the authors	2
10069	A2JQUIZZEGHVHK	My grandson said it was good, but not the best he had read. He said he didn't like the fact the sequels were costly.	2
10070	A3GXZHUXGNW502	This was entertaining. The actual story was good about the Dommes family and such. Didn't know people got into the BDSM so seriously, if that's the case.	2
10071	A4CEB14NMETWA	There are a few recipes I bookmarked, but mostly I skimmed over the whole thing. It's salad, so nothing to get super-excited about.	2
10072	A7JB4FLNBUX9Y	Very full of emotions. Enough character development to make it interesting, could have used more erotic passages, more creative and fulfilling descriptions.	2
10073	A3IQ5HVRNPSB0X	A good continuation but took a long time to move into the story itself. Needed to be longer or move into the relationship phase faster.	2
10074	A1DKQCC90FY7NX	Whatever you do, think about how often we say,&#34;Whatever&#34;.......read this you may be surprised.I hope our world never gets this bad though.	2
10075	AVK8XH4IJOL44	First, the story is super short and then it ended in a cliffhanger. If the next book isn't full size, I doubt I will read it.	2
10076	ALRFR8JP1FO4B	Nice  read with a Christian theme, but a bit predictable & superficial.  Easy read but not super enriching in my opinion.	2
10077	A2NL6CSFD2APBJ	This was a great read. I could not put it down. Can't wait to read other books by Jenna Stone.	2
10078	A2QU72989CEE6L	Was a good book can't wait to see what trouble spencer gets into with his bride. Should be a good one.	2
10079	A2F6VWL6XNOVSX	Nice story with a lot of potential. I think this author just needs to keep writing and find his/her niche. Fun read if you can get past the editorial errors.	2
10080	AV35BOXS0YZAH	I like the way the story started out, but it was basically just an introduction to one character in a different story.	2
10081	A12PAD91Z8VU7D	These story is boring. Not very developed you r left with a lot of unanswered questions. A totally waste of. Time and money	0
10082	A2IUBMDYCVM0A	I liked the story and it does make me want to read the rest of the series. But this story has been told before.	1
10083	AA36E93I33R7V	This book was okay, it gives insight to life in New Orleans during hurricane Katrinia that connects with the TV news stories.	2
10084	A21NQBS0SA85YR	If you have eaten very much Mexican food the're not much new in these receipes. I prefer those that I have learned from the Mexican cooks.	1
10085	A2SJTPICLIL4ZZ	The story was well written, and the subject intriguing.  The ending was startling and stays with you for some time.	2
10086	A31G4MNGZNYSZI	Running away in a blizzard opens doors to a new world that brings  wonder as well as a new danger trying to right wrongs for many.	2
10087	A31ZT26Q43CI1A	I didn't like this book much, but it is a little hard to tell what you get when you order.  Thank you for sending it to me on kindle anyway!	0
10088	A1SPKCPR0BAZMY	The book was good fun but quite predictable and a bit nothing which really meant it didn't manage to make four stars.	2
10089	AAHH55JAUT2M8	I couldn't rate this. It was horrible! The writer was so focused on her weight that there was so much missed.	0
10090	A37FAPA0X8EUWN	Probably the worst Amish book I have ever read.  Full of spelling errors.  Doesn't inspire the desire to read at all.	0
10091	AQ4C7D1WHZJ20	I had to overlook typos, and remember that the Book is fiction. But it was very interesting. Sometimes it was scripture, and other times fiction.	2
10092	A3QG5TKGO2U2KD	The writing skill is good.  I'm just not at all fond of the subject matter.  It started out interesting, but ended very badly.	0
10093	A14YP1L3N8ZNMC	Short story by a good storyteller and writer.  Story was horrific while still being sweet. Look forward to more from this author.Recommend	2
10094	AF82NHBG7X4PG	inspiring.  this is the kind of pick me up that I need. I have always loved a book that is inspiring.	2
10095	A1UPRXXTKHCA5	"A book with quick, simple and inexpensive solutions to common,  everyday problems by using vinegar. Great ideas for ""green"" solutions to cleaning problems, pet problems, and growing (plant) problems."	2
10096	A38753QO6EPKN6	left me wanting more. I just wasn't ready for the story to end, but I guess that means it was a good story.	2
10097	AZSPDKRZCMCNJ	just could not get into it fast enough and left it. I know some women hate that but I couldn't help it	1
10098	A1BS33VQK5QA76	If you like corny alien abduction romances...then this is your book. Short story....this is book Two of three.  Easy read.	1
10099	A16E75BMACS84	This story made me feel nauseated. While it was written well enough, it did not draw me in. It was just sickening.	1
10100	A2RFD97HHNZ6J0	This makes a handy reference book for those times when you need a nudge toward an idea. Recommended for writers of erotica.	2
10101	A2SGGQ9MH5XTUD	While they were all OK stories, they were almost the same story over 3 books.  After reading the first, the second & third books were very predictable.	2
10102	A3HHYAJNNC0AOA	Good ongoing story line, petty about the many typos. It is easy with spell check, manually reading it after that might be a good idea :)	2
10103	AB1QGGGCSUK1F	It's a very short book with well known information about some stars.  There are people in this book that I have never even heard of.	2
10104	A38OZ0XEGRW7G5	Didn't look when I bought it as I don't by books less than 250 pages. Was a good story she should have made it into a full book	2
10105	A15H8H0ZE3D28D	This book was semi-boring and difficult to follow.  I'm not sure if I would recommend it unless you're totally interested in this subject.	1
10106	A19LG3GFX888MM	I though this book could have move just a bit faster then it did to slow and it reminded me of other books along the same line	2
10107	ABWNKQD3018D6	Describes a threesome on an executive helicopter flight.  She expected action and &#34;dressed&#34; accordingly, but she was ecstatic when the second man borded.  Whoopee.	1
10108	AT04X1K0B4JHL	This is a beautiful short story about making mistakes and second chances.  It is a love story with a supernatural twist.	2
10109	A2NRDWWE0Z5HI0	Good ending to the series.  Glad you put everything into perspective, and explained the events in the book, but you could have brought back the mother.	2
10110	A2CC7AFBJJVLZ4	Well written but too short.  The author could have included more practice sessions to help drive home the new skill.	2
10111	A1L8IW24MJGGJ3	I'm giving two stars for the first story and one star for the second. I think the stories are too lame and not interesting enough.	1
10112	AQLLSFDY2QKO9	I felt this book was a bit YA for me. I was just expecting more. I read Marcos Redemption and really enjoyed it. This one just fell short.	2
10113	A8XX83JKP1PWH	Never would think something like this could actually happen. Glad there are counselors out there to help those in need out.	2
10114	A2KE2O5C2XMXGE	I keep picking this book up but cant seem to get thru it.  maybe its just me or its not the right time not sure.	1
10115	A2H19TYZFH5RGY	I love werewolves so this was a short treat for me . I will have to check into this series.  If the price isn't too much I will read them.	2
10116	A2Z1D37T1FSLE0	The book started out wonderfully.....then ended. I loved the characters and the setting. The story built, climaxed, and ended. Very abruptly. I was disappointed.	1
10117	AHZS4X5JQNEE6	Nothing really fit....he'd advance...in public...she allows it then...nothing....then it just leaves you hanging....don't bother...just leaves you a little angry at both  characters.	0
10118	AM9YFD3BZLHOA	I quite liked this story, it was short and sweet and kept me interested. I just sat there and read it right through.	2
10119	A1A3T4SCV5WUNT	"Very predictable, not too deep with emotion  or character descriptions, bit a cute read none the lessDefinitely a less descript version of th  movie ""enchanted."""	2
10120	AIPHCD0P3WYPL	Just keep reading hoping it would improve, it didn't. Lots of sex as an attempt to hot up the story but it doesn't just makes the character seem even sadder	2
10121	AQIYMF4X90D8E	Not worth to read..expect really real jokes..but more of repeated spiel..sometimes same introductory words only difference on the topics...dont buy	1
10122	A18V2OY2DHO2ED	Normally I enjoy reading books by Fern Michaels, this book howevermust have been a very early one.Really Couldn't get into it.....so I put it away.	2
10123	A3BTYCOT0H64ZW	Good reminder that we need to eat more fruit and veggies. Some of the recipes will be good to try.	2
10124	AEU7TW6A40FYC	Good book as far as it goes.  But I did not expect this book to be put in this category.  It was more a romance, no thriller.	2
10125	A10K9L57CXAQG5	Just an other attempt to get people to view President Obama favorably.  As is true with most publications on President Obama, no real solid information or view point was offered.	0
10126	A8NJ6F9CHIYW9	READ THE BOOK, FINISHED IT BUT REALLY DID NOT CARE FOR IT, DID NOT LIKE ANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE BOOK.	2
10127	AB6MXYLQQVQGI	The entire book reads like a set up of more interesting book which unfortunately you are not reading.  Share as the other book feels good.	1
10128	A38BARLQFLLAFA	It was ok.  Short not much to the story .I am not interested in reading any of the follow up books.	2
10129	A1ESF76N9NLS0P	This book sucks.  A major oversimplification of what us really required to make money online.  A simple web search would have been better.  2 stars.	1
10130	A3KF9GEKN2DXTU	Took five minutes to read. So not long enough but I'm working my way through all my MC books. Had to start somewhere.	2
10131	A1O12IUP30B0IW	This book was a okay read. Nothing really stood out that makes me want to purchase the next book in the series.	2
10132	AM5YM07VZGTNA	This was too dark for me, didn't realize I was more romance/happy ending. I love paranormal, but this was not my cup of tea. Read it & decide for yourself.	0
10133	A3VM0XN0MGWC0X	Sweet little love story.  Single mother falls in love with her sexy, grouchy boss.  Only angst involves bosses nasty Mom.	2
10134	A3LLTFNIUOPOLM	Some was hard to buy, but over all I enjoyed it. Don't know if I'll buy any more at this point.	2
10135	A15TJZZHX1Z4K2	It was your normal cute witchy love story at a great price. It was a quick read. Nothing spectacular but not horrible either....	2
10136	A3MK7JXTC29UJO	I was pleasantly surprised to read this book and was looking forward to the end but quit when it became sadistic. Not my cup of tea.	0
10137	AOUPEIOL1VGWP	Will be happy to read more by Ms. Conrad.  Pleasant afternoon reads by the pool	2
10138	A1BSVJKB1PXGFK	This was kind of a repeat from Rozalyn didnt realize t was only 50 pages when it got really interesting it ended. Twin always been trifiling and Shalea no better.	2
10139	A11PRSJD8V0R2H	Because of many ingredients I would not have many of the recipes. But it did give me some ideas to use.	2
10140	A3I4GFOL9U3830	I'm at a lost for words not in a good way I was bored I'm glad I'm done and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I knw	1
10141	A2AEHY15GMOC2Y	I think since I've read the first longer 6 stories&#8230;that this one wasn't up to the others. Still enjoyed it..	2
10142	A27UW67UW9NXAE	A nice read, and it is hard to find a really good dinosaurThriller. So not bad. Wished that one of the eggs had survived.	2
10143	AELG460KTFJNA	It's very short and does not actually say anything that isn't common knowledge. So glad I didn't pay for this essay. Complete waste of time.	0
10144	AF90QRBBDAJ78	Love cowboys with a little romance and a little mystery.  Rita Herron applies  both to her books and that makes them a fun read!	2
10145	A1TNVUMSPY8BM1	This book was all over the place. I'm hoping that thirds series will come to an end soon because dragging it on is becoming a bit much.	2
10146	A1NMUPG3KMWRZM	Claimed by the marineAshanti and hawk, her friends set her up to meet the handsome marine Hawk. The have chemistry right off the bat. But the book was really short.	2
10147	ABWMFJHYFPD5Y	There was really no story line to this short story. I guess if you like xxx then you mike like it.	0
10148	AZJA59OXKFPCM	Sweet, loving, sad and other things too.  Great family showing love for each other.  Not too  heavy.Thanks and easy reading.	1
10149	A3PX9CYLFBA8L0	Difficult subject to deal with, but the humor is sometimes possible, overall a good story, the illustrations could be improved, and a little sharpen the message.	2
10150	A156ARU6ZSPRBW	I could not make myself finish this book. I wanted to find something to like about it, but I could not.	0
10151	A3H2K7HCKGQA27	Now this was not a real story.  It was a very SHORT story so guess I missed that when I ordered.	1
10152	A33KKPDV847V9N	Just not for me.  I like a little more depth and mystery in the books I read even though I have a grandson called Blue.	2
10153	A2M8KYTHWQT7J4	I really like this genre but these books just did not flow and the story was not very good. I will I could return all of them.	1
10154	A3S6AFXPCFTMKM	This book was one of the most awful pieces of crap that I have ever had the misfortune to come across. Don't'waste or time with this. I beg of you!!	0
10155	A2SMHIVHZGSLNF	This book was way too short..Like a chapter long.  Thank goodness it was free.  I decided to pass on the next four short stories.	1
10156	A3TCKGHUHEI3IF	I was expecting more sizzle between the two main characters and the book did not deliver. Hopefully there will be a follow up for us to see what happens next.	1
10157	ADEJJ4NNUMDFZ	I don't understand this book... it confuses me.. how was I supposed to know it was only about 5 pages... what a drag..it should be naughty! [:	1
10158	A2MVBMMMIUFOWZ	I enjoyed the story, but Ryan's feelings never felt real to me until the very end. I felt the tension between the two, but Rachael's character was definitely better developed.	2
10159	ARUKNNAOB3ODQ	I didn't bother finishing it. It was ok, I assume some would like it, but it was kind of....twilighty. Not for me.	1
10160	A27OMJJ914NORW	Looks like there are some wonderful recipes in this book. Would have loved to have seen some pictures of finished products.	2
10161	AUHFGXAFAHC7Z	An unusual take on a very familiar story. Meeting the girls together makes the difference. Good story but not one I'll reread.	2
10162	A2WTMSQA5YL1HG	Just not for me. I realized going in this was a short story, but I felt there could have been more...development with the characters and story.	1
10163	A1ELQWH2G9NY7C	Its a pretty short story not really much to it. Probably could have been better if there was more to the story, as is its ok.	2
10164	A2DU926H8XBQHJ	"A good solid read, somewhat predictable at times. Characters, such as the "" good guys"" were very likeable. I would read another book by this author. Thanks!"	2
10165	AS09YZV00HGLO	It's not over the top but it was, pretty good. It was a basic bad boy meets good over worked girl and falls in love and tries to do good.	2
10166	A3TJOBVQ95HK9Z	I feel that the book is more for the young. The writing is not quite graphic enough for the adult readers. It just didn't quite get there.	2
10167	AGCU0OQHC6TN5	This was a good read. Good story, but it ended abruptly and badly. So what they kissed and made up. What about the kids and dad?	2
10168	A1PTUHLYXYZ7PF	I became bored with the writing within 5% of the book.  Too much redundancy and repetition and unimportant details in my opinion.	0
10169	A4ZIDHH7RQEFB	the first half of the book was good. Enjoyed it. the second half of the book was very dodgy. For its time it must have been wonderful.	2
10170	A1XLWKOY6AC0H8	this book was ok , i would not really want to read this again, but thanks for the read, ill keep looking for other books	2
10171	ATKUN8U38LMGM	It was an enjoyable read, so really don't have too many complaints.  Was it one of the best reads - no but okay for the price.	2
10172	A1GB4TU36TIW3B	This wasn't really a book.  More like a short story.  The story was ok, I was just expecting more.  Just don't be surprised like I was.	2
10173	A2JKJ07L1HMRZY	It's the same problem--you're paying $3 for 47 pages that can't stand on their own.  They begin in the middle of a scene and end in the middle of another.	0
10174	A35Z11MMBHBAZT	For the most part it was able to hold my interest. I have read better books but would recommend this one.	2
10175	A6MSM0H2707R0	This book was way to short and also stupid crazy ended way to fast for me I thought this book was something totally different	0
10176	A1TWGE6RAKYNT	Liked this but it definitely was too short! Wanted more with Blake and Erin. More of a story between them.	2
10177	A3F48IL54WVC7W	A good book; not great; but about the standard norm for this type of venue.  It's okay in my opinion.	2
10178	A1LVROO54WV2YH	I don't know how I felt about this book. I thought the story was interesting. Debating if I should read the next one.	2
10179	A2Z9B6YNWSN168	I am interested to see where the rest of this short series goes. Julie and Dominic came together so quickly with no challenges or knowing Julie's limits.	2
10180	A3QQ3G6YIZKGV	I tried to read this it sounded good. But I don't  know once I started I found  myself skipping parts and being bored.	1
10181	A20BHQ5OUN4QYV	Where do i begin ?i love the author but really what happen between the beast n this i am lost let me try another since i brought many of them	0
10182	AN3GS70LD9Y1G	Thank goodness this was a short story.  It was a &#34;Don't jump to conclusions&#34; story.  I wouldn't rush to read another of her books.	2
10183	A3M4DQ2D5U0T0B	Loved the book it's a page turner I loved it I would read it again .. thank u for a great book can't wait for book 3	2
10184	A2YKTHK21EW0QZ	A decent read. Entertaining might be a good word and don't you expcect to be either entertained or informed when you read a book?	2
10185	A220BH2ORA4JEF	It did not go deep enough other than the fact a crazy guy hides in the closet. Wish it made more sense.	1
10186	A23SBRGWSLZIKS	Not sure if it was how it was wrote or the story line but i didn't like it. It just didn't catch my attention	2
10187	A7LD1TK5M7VAS	I don't remember reading this book so that in itself explains what kind of book it was. good enough to pass the time I guess	2
10188	A2I2ZLATU7DVW1	It was an interesting read, however, for those of you who don't like the bad language, you'll need to skip this one.	0
10189	A2INJLFHTQQTDJ	I thought this book was okay,was a little hard to like Adam (the main male character). But over all it kept my attention.	2
10190	A1YNDZLDTKGUWP	This would be an even better mystery without all the sexual references which have nothing to do with the plot.	2
10191	AWZOI7S0XTHJ0	It kept me interested enough to get the second installment.  I still wish it was a little bit longer though.	2
10192	AAFOJ2TZZXNZK	The headline pretty much sums up my comments. As far as I was concerned, the story was just plain dirty..	1
10193	A9RV65QZ4A8KA	I was unable to get the pictures to come up. Quite a disappointment. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more.	2
10194	A37KZWNU20KFF6	This is an ok book for a light read.  It isn't one of my favorites and I wish it had been longer I only read the first story.	2
10195	ACPUDZPRNNUAH	I enjoyed the book just as much as the first. I would definitely recommend this book for all to read.	2
10196	AJGMNIJQLQZSV	Sweet story but I felt like something was missing. The couple was too perfect and that just made it so unrelatable. I gave it 3.5 stars	2
10197	A2HSAKHC3IBRE6	I'm not prudish and I understand people use bad language. There was too much for me on page one. I stopped. Done. Not going to try and read any further.	0
10198	A3W1HBVSSLFHX5	I feel like Lily,and Kyle's relationship was very rushedlike I didn't have time to root for Lily to be with KyleI just couldn't get into the book	1
10199	A2CJRU4KQ8WRC	She writes well I just do not like cliche lines and the characters all seem the same. Everything always works out too perfectly. Just a little cheesy to me.	1
10200	AQ1HLMG5WR711	Started off interesting. Author jumped around a lot.. one chapter had me confused by I introducing new character. Good read	2
10201	AKOLD2E17G0G0	Skimmed most of the book, but doubt I missed any really good parts.  Not to thrilled with Carrie, she seemed a little shallow o me, but did like Chip.	0
10202	AY2WVB3CKFXFZ	It could have been better if it was longer. The story line was good but it just needed more details.	1
10203	A2RWZKMC2E9864	I just couldn't get into it. I had read so much about him and heard great things but i just could not follow the stories at all.	0
10204	A3UIQ4LBUO29S	It Okay, but he is not my favorite author. I never read Kipling before so I thought I might enjoy it.	2
10205	A3UXW2QEBI7OKT	I had a difficult time reading this book. I did not find it funny, more juvenile than anything. Was unable to finish.	1
10206	A332Q8YWI42J90	The story was well written but the ending left alot of unanswered questions. It gave me the feeling I was set-up.	2
10207	A2NV8ECUE5QPAW	This is soft core porn masquerading as a childhood abuse memoir.  Extremely poorly written, most likely by a male who uses the title &#34;doctor&#34; for credibility.  Don't waste your time.	0
10208	A2041Y6RG0F243	Not sure how I actually feel about this book. I loved the female lead, but I can't quite make up my mind about the male. Still not sure.	2
10209	A1ZM4DHSCITGM1	Did not care for this one.  Weak story line, Characters not too interesting and story rambled (for me). Was't quite sure what the plot was.	1
10210	A24J97BN1RW91Q	the story started out really well but didn't last long and was over before it ever really got going.  not what I expected.	1
10211	A12XC07V4QRTCJ	It was an ok book. It wasn't even close to the best books I have read, but it was ok.	2
10212	A3U01929F3MOR8	I was a little disappointed that it was so short and really had no plot.  Not enough description in the characters.	1
10213	ATEGS1QH2L37Q	I was hoping for more impact based on the description. It simply was as good as I was hoping for.	1
10214	A2N2EVPEKBPWEO	Did not like it. did not finish it	0
10215	AOBLHLZYS34IL	I really liked the story line. Real love has no barriers that can't be overcome. Stephano & Natalie made a great couple.	2
10216	A28REJAM6899K8	These three stories were mild instances of erotica but very well written. Short yet still sexy and would like to read more.	2
10217	AZMMFZKJB8PV6	i could not get into this book, i was bored and found myself flipping fast through pages ,trying to get the gist of it, wasn't for me	1
10218	A2GJQGHQIDYGR3	Not a bad book. Interesting story line and characters.  A relatively quick read that entertains with a little surprise of finding the identity of the Dom.	2
10219	A1IM9GTPAFRZ0C	I totally get that these books are not meant to be super long....but 25-50 pages is really not being fair to your readers especially for $2.99!	2
10220	A26IH6RSUSW26U	A very cute story. I enjoyed the characters. I would recommend the book to my older friends. Would an eighty-year old woman have a 2 year-old grandson?	2
10221	A4CYDDV1UIJO3	Good book just wanted a bit more something to keep me interested. Not sure if I'll read part 2	2
10222	A2PY4KK3HRXJ2V	I found it was to long to plot and it was boring to me. Possibly it wasn't a good choice for me.	1
10223	A3R9HQQV6ON9LO	Not much meat in it.  I got bored with it quickly.  Nothing particularly interesting.  Wasn't worth my time downloading and got rid of it.	0
10224	A37FKL4OTGFWKM	It is horribly written and also was done rather fast as it makes no sense in most of it.  I gave up after chapter two.  Don't waste your money	0
10225	A1DW4766GPDVFM	Yes, disappointed that this was not really a book, just an introduction to a previous book - what am I missing here [other than the real book]?	2
10226	A1JRRDS066HDXP	Purchaed this thinking it would be similar to the movie but was disappointed. Nothing like it at all. SMH :(	1
10227	A1A8RTJJ48T9TS	Needs a little polish here and their but has the chance to be amazing.I love other books done by K.S Martin and will read more in the future.	2
10228	A4XB148ESOT1B	Unless you are plagued with self-doubt, forget this one. It is a hard sales pitch that you really can write, with a few familiar tips thrown in.	1
10229	A2AHXQYWRVSFLX	I like the idea of the book but I figured out what was going on very early on. It was well written and I still enjoyed the read.	2
10230	A2J841GSIIFLF0	I didn't realize this novella would be so short...10 minutes and it was over!I do like the author and have read her before.	2
10231	A1ACIK34MC3R7W	This story should have been really cute, instead I kept thinking Trevor grow a pair and girlfriend move on.  Poor choice.	1
10232	A9XQWOWAWXYQT	I liked the story, but it was poorly written and edited. There are lots of grammatical errors, wrong tense used, etc., which makes it difficult to read.	1
10233	A3FTX4QREE6D1E	The story had some parts that were good but not enough. I struggled to finish, and hated the ending. Hope if the writers other book is better.	1
10234	A3E3X4X7YAT1D3	It was a good story line; expect for the bad words. I really don't care for story's that use swear words.	1
10235	A3JVICFD5REACI	A very short read. Not much to it because of its brevity. Though it would be longer and the story more developed.	2
10236	A1DQSJ5DS8R1VZ	Don't like this series of get in bed and pregnant at the drop of a hat but not a bad read overall.	2
10237	A2UHMP850BRDTA	Interesting read. Kept me involved and wanting to know more of what Cath was going thru. Good writing, good book.	2
10238	A2MBW4IRJ39SC1	A funny, ridiculous short story that needed a bit of editing. The idea behind the story is good and the humor is wicked.I wish it had been better.	2
10239	A3CDYLT8SSCB4L	Scary.  I would like to think that friends wouldn't do something so heinous, but it does happen.  And in most cases, no one ever knows why.	2
10240	A19A1I6FWJTWGE	Total fairy tale. The female mind is really deranged! I thought my grand daughter made up better stories playing with Barbie!	1
10241	A2AAAZKAJ9KHHG	I good variety of smoothie recipes for when you need that extra inspiration to choose one to have. Some good ideas and easy to follow recipes.	2
10242	A1ELVLUIIEYSUQ	the book should have a better description.the jokes were bad not at all funny.i deleted it after the few jokes.NOT FOR KIDS LIKE ME	0
10243	AN3GS70LD9Y1G	The story was pretty good, but it was not the kind you couldn't put down.  The ending wasn't as dramatic as most mysteries are.	2
10244	AFIH80GNTHP5C	I liked the book, but the closing was really sped up and quite hilarious. If you want a light reading, it's okay	2
10245	A1FCVX9J52FFDO	A happy non guessing short story, was nice to read.  Felt like it was outlined all the way. Happy is good.	2
10246	A5KXV9C2A6TIK	Its a good read was fast and it ran along with all the other shifter books but with alittle more to the story.	2
10247	A2G5V60CZQFE3K	This was so poorly done that I can't even begin to say how bad it was.  Don't waste your time.	0
10248	A9GADKYN21JN	I don't need to be lectured on the wrongs of racism in the past.  Other than that it was an entertaining story with a somewhat predictable ending.	2
10249	A107KJ5XSAD7K9	Not recommended if you like a well developed story.  Found it boring and didn't complete reading the series as it couldn't keep my attention.	1
10250	A2V94CJD7WQF8E	This book would have been better if it wasn't wrote in different parts. Overall the book was interesting and had a good plot.	2
10251	A35PXO2XEG2Y1L	I had a time trying to keep all the main characters straight.  There was too much that had nothing to do with the story line.	1
10252	A1CF2XZW51HZRP	Really just wasn't worth the time. It was kind of bland all throughout. Felt like the author was just going through the motions.	0
10253	A24R8KIIA2IC6K	Interesting College.  I was expecting the different personalities but not the differentSupernatural persons.  Pretty good mystery line with a very unexpected villain.	2
10254	A1CXAWNY6JUMV9	this was hands down the worse book i have ever read and trst me that says alot	0
10255	A3P9D9ZYQS5MMZ	Dumb ending.poorly written. Stupid storyline . Whole words missing. Don't waste your money, it's free don't waste your time!!!!!!!!!! Seriously	0
10256	A1YPLFK7EIEVUX	I DID NOT LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER. THE STORY WAS NOT BAD, BUT IT IS NOT SOMETHING I WILL READ AGAIN, AND CAN NOT RECOMMEND IT TO OTHER READERS	1
10257	A3E68X9J8DPMA2	These were some pretty good stories.I enjoyed reading them and I would recommend reading all of the stories in this book to others	2
10258	AW8JVEM7GXHNY	I can't in good conscience call this a book, novel, novella or short story. It lacks any depth. The ending is ridiculous. However, the editing was done properly .	0
10259	A277WLH2TQJWD3	Tiffany is a glorified prostitute to get the money to pay for her boob job. they make it look glamorous, but prostitution is prostitution.	1
10260	A3435ZBCT588IY	Quite a sad story, made for a good afternoon read though :) makes you appreciate your family, friends & time together	2
10261	A17K95SEU3J68U	Just way too much blood shed and little real story . Repeat actions , with different characters and not really interesting.	1
10262	A1HWRJWHIOU2HF	I got lost in this story.  Things seemed to jump around alot.  It`s not all bad but it an ok story.  I have book two I hope it gets better.	1
10263	A3JPAPFAZV03JP	This book was fine to read but found it a bit predictable but still a lighthearted read that didn't take too much effort.	2
10264	A3T5AHE7EA2YYS	Never read it because I thought it was a different author.  Still have may read some day	0
10265	A24LDJ9VSNNEWK	Too many sexual events and not enough letting you know what is actually going on in connection with the plot.	1
10266	A32AUTWA8MM81K	A sweet innocuous story.  Enjoyable story line and benign.  There is a fun set of characters and clean and fun	2
10267	AE5IA4M4NQLY	Not as good as the last one I read by this author, but an easy hour read when I had nothing better to do.	2
10268	A1BQYUZ59QHHJM	Not a bad story but has no real punch when it comes to the story line.  Things are as pretty well expected.  Just a nice love story.	2
10269	A3M5YS2ZSULD0L	Being a fan of Jack Reacher, this series is very confusing.  But again, maybe this fan really really doesn't know Jack!  But I don't see Jack being in a box	2
10270	A44MQ7CODU3PK	This book was sweet but it could have included a little more paranormal. The characters were sweet but I am tired of short thrown together stories that call themselves paranormal.	2
10271	A2ULO0PDA84RXW	It was a good short story. Enjoyed reading it. I like most Christian books and will continue to read them.	2
10272	A309FUO9AZ07XC	I always have liked snarly-oops, snarky humor with sex especially smokin hot down n dirty affectionate hot sex. Finest kind!!!	2
10273	A25KVVIREFBWXT	I guess this time around, the stories really did not get my full attention.  It's OK reading, to long a drawn out on some of the plots.	2
10274	A2U70PXZEOI134	I love the hell hound. I would have enjoyed less sappy romance and more story. I do appreciate this short story to introduce me to this series.	2
10275	A1IOR3OTTUK3O5	give me a break, just as i was liking this it ended.  way too short even for a single....why bother.	1
10276	A34K6BOF313CGN	It was different but I assure you it will be a fun ride for some to read. Lots of sex scene details and that I loved.	2
10277	A2B9C3FMYW18UN	I enjoyed this book but it was very short. There must be another book because there was no ending. The characters were good and the story line was good.	1
10278	A1BNPYIQXUQ551	It diced out just the right about of romance and mystery. A good book to read on a rainy day, it will keep you turning the pages until you finish	2
10279	A1D67S3HHZHEQ7	I found it a bit slow trying to get interested in the story.  I had to force myself to percivere until I got into the story.	2
10280	A15VDUFBGBTAUG	Werewolf Interrupted is not a very complex story, but just fun to read! The novel gives a different slant on the werewolf legend.	2
10281	A2XKX5TBB6WV00	This was a nice quick action-packed read. A lot happened in a short amount of time. Interested to read the next book in the series.	2
10282	A2IFNFGRWLZNX8	I read part 2 to the series first and I perfer it. This one was okay. I love Maya, her books keep you going throughout the story. A fast read	2
10283	A2M3FR1I9ACHXO	This book is simply a re-hash of books and aids written or presented in the past; frankly, I don't think it's worth the time - certainly not a fond memory!	1
10284	A3LLZC3MT5PYP2	"This is literally a ""A is for Apple"" kind of book, probably not intended for children older than 5. The connections are cute and playfull."	0
10285	AQDAR0YHB9NZ3	Too short a story prefer longer with more story lineLiked the story given and the charactersFor short story ok but not for me	2
10286	AQS2784T19CBY	Not into vampires. Didn't know that was one of the 4.	1
10287	ACKMVD3FEMLLD	Great promise but lacking! The cover is Hot Hot Hot but story slow moving! Could easily be fixed to have more appeal!	2
10288	A2C7CA9AKTFTFI	I like books that could be realistic this book was ok but short to the point I guess but not really all that realistic in my eyes.	1
10289	A27J2K9RU1JCFE	Did not like any of the books I purchased by this author.  Did not finish the ones I started and did not read the rest.	0
10290	A1SPI19SRINZ19	There really is not anything new in this book.  You can find the same how to 's for free on the internet.	2
10291	A3J0J7R3DVTFYI	More a discussion on why someone should consider wholesaling than an informed how to guide.	1
10292	A3KKQ01457FLH7	This was a cute, fun, romantic, clean yet sexy story, all the characters became friends, and even if the ending was predictable, it was a good read.	2
10293	A2663EMQ257KPZ	What? This novel is historically inaccurate ...insulting to Scots....why take such liberties with the legend of Robin Hood. Honestly the worst I've read lately	0
10294	A2IXFVZM10Q0FU	I really liked this short story...I think it would also make a great novel if the story line were expanded.  Great job!!!	2
10295	A2ZJ2KR4ADH0E	Was ok but not a memorable work compared to his other books. I think you could skip this and not miss much.	2
10296	A1C35W8O32CZK6	I liked it it just went by too quickly. The author need to tell a story more. Not rush it	2
10297	A1WRTTCPOUB9KT	Not so great.  Too many iffies in the story and the situations posed is not too credulous.  I like the the follow-up better.	1
10298	AVA5AKBH39383	I really was into this read good page turner till the last few chapters. I was lost and confused. I would read the third book though	2
10299	A1BNBSZBHJOV29	Fun book to read.  I liked the idea of the enforcers.  A few things seemed a little out of character.  Nice love story until the end.	2
10300	AZ3WQ5ZS3PAWB	SO NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST FOUR INSERIES. THIS STORY WAS ESPECIALLY LAME. I'M GOING TO STOP READING THE SERIES.	1
10301	A130TZ1CHF1HWT	Its plot was really weird.  I was hoping for more.  Really did not want to look for any other books from the series.	2
10302	AXG5G9KS9YKXE	This book was ok... my favorite part was probably the short story at the end when the sky fell down.	2
10303	A3UB9TU0EDNR5N	I found the story to be way to short, and not as interesting as most. Didn't have enough body to the story.	2
10304	A2KP3BKN2QX0K9	I am glad I downloaded this book, we should all read about healthy alternatives to keep ourselves healthy and whole.	2
10305	ALE1RHSAYMBJK	spent way too much time backslapping and hi-fiving each other.....felt like I was reading a &#34;Car Talk&#34; segment about books, minus Dewey Cheatem and Howe......	2
10306	A1I4VM94N3EM0W	Worst most useless book j have ever read. All the ideas were just pulled from the web. Read the book in less than 5 minutes.	0
10307	A5W7X6KON25MW	Just a few short recipes, cooking instructions aren't always complete.  Not into eggplant or arugola. It's a hit or miss kinda book.  Depends on what you like.	1
10308	A2RPSEFTTRYF8I	The story is good but the conversion to digital is lousy some page's have 1line of text down the left side just sloppy work. Otherwise not a bad book.	1
10309	A31QTYMH6TF1NX	I suppose this was meant to be funny. It really isn't. Strange characterisation, odd plot or rather lack there of, and silly ideas all around. Stay away.	0
10310	AJUZ5ZTKSW4D1	It was okay but would rather spend my time reading something more interesting.  I will not read this author again.	2
10311	A2EE1UV2NXG5OL	This was more of a short story than a book, and even though it was interesting and exciting, it was too short and without much substance.	2
10312	A1UL9UKI0R8JWN	Good mystery with a good group of characters. Keeps you wanting to read more. Hope the series continues in the future	2
10313	A2UFJC04MZTQAX	Entertaining!!!!! Simple little mystery. Nothing fancy or deep but definitely entertaining!!!!!! I would recommend these Joe Gray books for pleasure easy reading that is good entertainment!!!!!	2
10314	A3ALFWYFPNEO3O	Once again McCray has successfully combined romance, comedy, and action, while still keeping the reader wanting more.  Lite reading that is always enjoyable.	2
10315	A3L4VHNW35ISQK	There are a lot of cute sayings in this little book, but I'm glad I only spent .99 cents for it.	2
10316	A1840PJZBE47TP	Pros: Story had the usual twists & turns.  Kept interestCons: a very political drumbeat thru out the book.I didn't like the obvious, agenda	2
10317	A7CZSRM0JJVJP	Enjoyed the storyline but the ending didn't make any sense, at least to me.  Like the characters, love the dog.  Don't know if I'll read other books in the series.	2
10318	AZP7CQWQTM38M	Keeps you paging. Ends too soon.  It leaves you with just enough to want to know more? Waiting to see who did it	2
10319	A1RQL364CTFBWL	This is an unusual version but satisfying in its own way. Darcy is wonderful but it has so much silliness that it takes away the love.	2
10320	A23X7R6EN788Z1	I thought this was quite good for a quick fun read. Some cute ideas and presented well with the 'hints'	2
10321	A18W0P3M6SBE18	It's well written, romantic and erotic. However, the end is predictable. For readers that enjoy reading books with little substance	2
10322	A2OXTGDW7A9HUN	Refreshing take on old story. Should be fun read, can't wait for part two. Believable characters and responses, you can see yourself doing the same in her place.	2
10323	A3M1QXWY2RNHXC	Slow in the beginning but grows on you and pulls you in in the end. Easy beach read. Would recommend.	2
10324	A32UDZXVDJ2DA5	Nice but too short. Of course I got it for free thru Amazon on my Kindle, so it was well worth the money.	2
10325	A3M3ONSKOWH9GR	Amazing the wisdom of Reacher even at age sixteen. A street fighter like no other.  Surprise ending. An entertaining, short read.	2
10326	A7QAZIA25Q70A	SoI liked ed the book but it was to  short.  If you are going toWritten a book  then you need to take more time in what you are writing.	1
10327	A38GNCFDIRZRF8	Good recipes can't wait to  try some of them.  I love Gooseberry patch  catalog things so it's a good thing.	2
10328	AQAS1MX0EG5J2	This book left me hanging .. I don't like books like this.. It's seems as I wasted my money for nothing... Ugggggggh	1
10329	A3ROD3SWV7H1KN	The storyline was a little bit cheesy. But on the other hand graphic of the intimate scene oh my oh my. Nice, short and naughty	2
10330	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	I did not care for it. It was not a good to read if you were expecting a romance story.	1
10331	A2MZ8TXGPG607T	Immature, lacking interesting characters and filled with silly lines. I tried, I wanted something funny but this was just not it for me.	0
10332	A26X8RMJCEND86	A little over the top. The characters seem shallow. I didn't think it was that great. It just stopped abruptly at the end.	1
10333	A1ABVZ48SCTOK1	Light and fun. Not great literature, but a great value for the money if you like Regencies. Mind candy for sure.	2
10334	A29R9A85J2JGRU	Ok read nothing special. I think the storyline has potential and needs character development even if it is just an ebook.	2
10335	ADXCWBZ2R9XMD	two alpha types...should never happen, especially not these two either. Could the mate be any more annoying...I wanted to rip my hair out at times...I wouldn't recommend it.	0
10336	ADMIK6YBIVPHR	This booked dragged a little. I felt like there were only three scenes in the entire book. Obviously I still enjoyed it and cannot wait to read part 4.	2
10337	A2GZNJ9QO93ENU	This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read.  I really don't know why I finished it.  I hope no one else wastes their money.	0
10338	A32WO20EFGJWKY	Victoria was rather.....busy....and creative. And it sounds like her late husband was also. Interesting twists in this story. An entertaining read.	2
10339	A3SRJ2UK1VRKM4	As it was the first Zane Grey novel I had read it was easy to put down and pickup while on a holiday.	2
10340	A3EZ9PLRWDUXT0	Okay I didn't pay for this book and that's the best thing about this. I wouldn't recommend this book. The story lines were slow and the sex scenes were bad.	0
10341	AZ4AGUJC4T8X	Not her best work, Can't believe Sue Grafton even wrote this one. I love her ABC BOOKS BUT THIS ONE i BARELY GOT THROUGH	2
10342	A3T4Y7HIZZUA1Q	Good rainy evening reading. hunky heroes!Like Catherine Byber Characters, will definitely read more of her in the future. Good plot.	2
10343	A2TJIU9F2N9P00	I don't know what it was, but I couldn't get into this book at all. I got about halfway through and put it down.	1
10344	A30V9M9DZW8SFU	some stories were repeats  I did not like from other anthologies the other were too cheesy... definite delete from my library	0
10345	A2N5V5771HB5B7	I just started to get into the story and they want you to buy another book there is no finish to the first story	1
10346	A16EIVT7QTH4D0	Good book, well written, and good romantic novel. It is book worth reading, and it is a quick read, so cover up, settle down and read.	2
10347	AVRYGBHNOZLWP	It needs some editing and formatting so the reader knows if the characters are remembering the past or living the present.Thanks for sharing your stories with us.	1
10348	A19V69ALWEWWD7	Some of the stories were good. Others were not. The short ones needed more content. They really weren't that erotic since they were soooo short.	2
10349	AL2A4EMGQWIET	Not my sort of thing at all I'm afraid. Didn't like the writing style or content at all. Had thought it might be interesting but just didn't like it. Sorry	1
10350	A3I125PAG9EBYR	The beginning was slow and then it was fun but the ending was lame.  Loved the middle of the book.	2
10351	A2HYJOD65JFB31	3-Stars because I didn't know it was a short story! :-(.  Just as it picked up. And  do ladies really use that f-word so much?	2
10352	A2DGFKNCX1O3F8	It's a cute story, but nothing special.  Quick read.  Worth getting for free, I am not sure I would spend money on it though.	2
10353	A04677952VY8X6LBI1GWY	Did not like this because it had too much erotica  The plots were good if you could skip over the other	2
10354	A40OVUBLU06TZ	The classic adage was ignored here. It felt like reading a biography, not a steamy romance. Just not the type of story for me, I suppose.	0
10355	A4XJZOFLZ1QY2	well, I read the whole thing but it really was bad. I won't post any spoilers, but the writer wasn't strong enough to pull off the &#34;plot twist&#34;	0
10356	A1PLQ9HLUE5DHD	I don't usually write bad reviews, but this had to be the longest most boring book ever. I kept reading hoping it would get better.. it didn't.	1
10357	A33OXM7LDFO22K	The concept of wildflowers to go with the heroines could have been more developed.  A paragraph or so just wasn't enough to build a correlation.	2
10358	A1QZMCYNISJ4WP	How did this girl become a completely different person after meeting the guy?  Even down to picking a nick name that would match his.  I didn't finish the book.	1
10359	A3485RDJQG4FNX	The book was much to short and was a tease to leed into the next book.It was also a little confusing.	1
10360	A25TQOFU1EAJXF	Cliched, boring, short, and nothing to write home about. At first it seemed like it would be a good read, but in the end all I found was it lacking.	1
10361	A1AP3DK2U1ONPU	To forgive in a relationship is the best part of have one. Collins shows us in this story how it is done through Troy.	2
10362	A293W2MU6STRGP	Romance realism  and wiccan spells all mixed up in a book with believable characters and a simple plot to make a good read.dottiek	2
10363	A2KE0TU7XK89QE	The same old same old, and the price of the bookdidn't help either. But am still a fan any day.	2
10364	A3D01CE6G4VKBA	I liked the beginning but thought it ended too soo.  I would like to have been given more regarding the hero.	2
10365	A2W9R5WQGRG900	I found the book hard to get into. By the time I was settling into it, it was over. The characters had no depth and I hate that.	1
10366	A1IRQPHQC2RTXS	Id just punch the guy in the face and end the book like that, but that's just me. It's a quick read also.	2
10367	ATXP34MCBFMP7	THis was AWFUL!  I had to delete this from my library, I couldn't stand to even look at the cover.	0
10368	A1SOEVVJ8THYTX	Ok light read has a twist in there but you get to there and that's it. Enjoy a small light read.	2
10369	A3D6ZZ5AD5AR2E	It was quite a light story - I was sorry that it just seemed to come to a sudden halt!  Enjoyable reading, sure!	2
10370	A3354QQZP3S2U9	So just the star should be enough for this review...ONE STAR...	0
10371	AMD7163PDVVWH	I thought I had already submitted a review, but will give another one.  A good read, keeps your interest alive.	2
10372	A2C2MGQSOO8UFK	This is not quite Sci-Fi, but it borders on it.  The author projects what will happen to America down the road if it continues to be a godless society.	1
10373	A3F4TFY7766LQO	It is always best to just be honest and tell the truth.  Every time people think they are protecting others or themselves they are probably just messing things up more.	2
10374	A11E16L5QK8HFM	A cliche. A no brainer. If this is a theme of the authors other books, then I'm glad I wasted my time on this short one.	1
10375	A31G1JP0ZCHS5L	This is a cute book and interesting to read. You do not know until the very end what will happen. The mother is behind the whole story.	2
10376	AWSM7313YDGSB	Although the concept of an avenging angel is nice there is absolutely no story here. Glad this was such a short read.	2
10377	A12RCE3OS1KFG9	Short story that keeps you wanting more. I would have preferred a longer story and not put the next one off.	2
10378	A1Y2GY7CDJHYVK	Just not my style.  Another book that didn't live up to the preview.  Too much senseless and graphic violence for my taste	1
10379	A3361XGKYF17S3	This book was just ok for me. It didn't really hold my interest to much. I skipped pages throughout the book..	2
10380	A2H76J4XCC59MM	Oh loved if from beginning to end perfectCouldn't get enough and fell in love with Owin love this book	2
10381	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	I really did like this story but I think the over $4. price tag was a bit  high and would think twice before purchasing another by this author.	2
10382	A1MMRTP2C2XF1G	Good read. Story has passion, sex, and drama what more could you ask for. Recommend for an in between series read.	2
10383	A19V69ALWEWWD7	Got me hooked enough to get the next book. Enjoying the style of writing so far and the story keeps you guessing.	2
10384	A317YD3C1B79LP	For a story this short it took a long time for the author to get to the point.  I found myself skipping pages waiting for something to happen.	1
10385	A5IDWDZ2L1LA	This was a good short story. Nothing amazing, but a nice little read to fill in the time of how and what happened with Meghan when she reached Winter's court.	2
10386	A2057ETBJ052PA	Not as good as the first 3 short stories.  It just got too far fetched for me and I didn't believe the reasons behind the outbreak.	2
10387	AMV2Z2PMQ0Q2E	A mail order bride  gets shot by her husband to be. Misunderstandings flourish from that point on. Nevertheless, all is well that ends well.	2
10388	A1S4ONAC5FEKIY	The story line is very predictable. No thinking is required so this is the book(s) you take to read while waiting for your doctor's appointment.	2
10389	A19T1A4TS1WHOZ	but still similar in many ways. The snake in the garden is huge and hideous and insidious. Still it, is hard to put down.	2
10390	A31OILKQJMO07W	Conversations between characters were stilted. Poor job of editing. It read as if a high schooler wrote it. Very disappointed.	1
10391	A3094BDN9YTIBN	It was cute but kind of slow, somewhat typical but cute read. I was rooting for them to get back together	2
10392	A1Q1ASCEQN17O7	I personally did not like the writing, moving from one character to the other.  Same story, written in the other character's view.  Weak characters in my opinion.	2
10393	A31QEUT7ZG7UEM	I'm at a lost for words because a new personality was introduced in this book.Amena... Brought a new twist. I'll being waiting for part 3 SW!	2
10394	A3DW4J98F6G8JJ	Some pretty good recipes. Some are way too complicated with too many steps. Not much else to say...Just OK...Glad I got it for free.	2
10395	A16RE3TUG5NKH7	"This was a short, sweet romance. I didn't ""feel"" the chemistry between the characters that usually accompanies romance but it was still an enjoyable read."	2
10396	AI2KWL5CIQSSU	This book did not make sense to me. The beginning was weird and the ending was weirder.  I do not recommend this book at all.	1
10397	A1MU891B1PTS12	I couldn't finish it because it was so creepy. Very uncomfortable to read. A man given care of a teenager shouldn't be listing after her.	1
10398	A059360538W5QBLKQPTMU	Although the story is compelling, there is too much sex and brutality in the details of this book.  Someone should have done serious editing before distributing it ti	2
10399	A3E68X9J8DPMA2	This was a good short little story.I enjoyed reading it and was intrigued by the ending.A defiantly worth reading.Check it out	2
10400	AMB648K7UW4U7	Try Reuters international for $1.99 per month and leave the liberal opinion pages to the drama seekers.  You pay $9.99 for more left wing political opnion pages than news.	0
10401	A3PAQE3QWKAE2N	I like to think of myself as a spiritual person, but this book was even out there too far for me. I could not get into it at all.	2
10402	AO46WQ0PYLNBD	Cute ways to decorate cupcakes that the kids could love or for a special occasion like a baby shower. Cute.	2
10403	A1O4SI7IDI7448	Not really my kind of stories but worth the read. Found it to be a tad disjointed and hard to understand in some places. Not bad overall though.	2
10404	A3AQKF73Y2VWTL	I liked the story it was cute. But wish there would have been more of a back story, like more flash backs I guess.	2
10405	AHBARDTLF35PU	It was alright. Way too long and a lot od unnecessary elaboration that couldve been avoided to make this book shorter.It wasnt great, but alright!	2
10406	A1I2GZ0G2KHPL9	Are you kidding me. Like dropping in on the end of a movie. I love her books but not this.	1
10407	A3GMQR5SLYW9UN	Granted this book is free but it's no excuse for poor grammar.  Hire an editor please. At the very least ask someone to proofread before publishing .	0
10408	A3094BDN9YTIBN	it was a little confusing in the beginning but eventually it started to make sense and the antagonist was rather mild but good enough read	2
10409	A2TKYJHLNK1WG9	Writer trys to speak in the mountain language, and does poorly. you lose interest in the books quickly trying to figure out what he is saying and trying to confae	1
10410	A2PDAT5MVMN326	As stated, not my cup of tea.  I like romance, adventure, science fiction, fantasy - but ONLY when written with the discerning reader in mind.	0
10411	A37ZWSZVL6CULU	It's a decent series and I'm glad I read it but I wish some parts of the book happened sooner and the ending was different.	2
10412	A3I3I3T74QXY1T	This sloppy attempt at a morality tale with a feline twist makes a mockery of a Christmas classic. You can't love cats enough to make this litter worthwhile.	0
10413	A1IP8K5BLO6VWL	Bought this by mistake and returned the book. Sorry. I am straight and have no interest in this life style.	0
10414	AA726IIV1H01	I liked the initial story line, but it turned out that the main characters were bizarre in many ways. I would never read again.	0
10415	A24H5TP8HNEKQZ	There was no good plot in this book. I don't see myself reading another book by her.SORRY but maybe I will give her another chancr	2
10416	A2ANOOOUR2B7ZP	You have a good premisis for the book, except you have a strong independant woman who looses herself in King. Its not bad simply not for me.	2
10417	AAKOOEBLSQFL6	It's ok so far! It's not my thing, I only downloaded it because its free. Otherwise its not too much to it.	0
10418	A19DWIC1T7127Y	I thought the story was rushed and unrealistic.  Half the book was sex without much story development.  I was really disappointed!!	1
10419	A238YH8VK6U4HK	Nice story, very romantic, hero saves the helpless beauty. Good romance story for a new reader, to tame for my taste.	2
10420	A2AYH9TNEAGGUS	I love the cover of this book. And the first couple of chapters are great. I found the story moved rather fast after that and the characters lost some depth.	2
10421	AYTGC0RA4E6IP	This was an o.k. story.  I fell asleep a couple timez, but hey tht could be just me. Not !, everyone likes different thingz.	2
10422	A29T92HFUVM2NT	The book was extremely slow. I was bored and found myself skipping pages just to awake.  If you're having problems sleeping then this is the book for you.	1
10423	A2B2NVZI2Z5WSO	Seemed like a book report not a fun or interesting book for chilren. Very Dull.	0
10424	A2RHA5XBZMNNMD	Didn't like the characters much, neither of them had much to recommend them, so it was tough to stick with it.	2
10425	A15N0JTFGTCWP0	Weird plot but it is a good book to read for school because it is a page turner and tells a lot about life	2
10426	AGLMUVRBOAM24	I liked the book, but you have to read the origonal story first.  If you do not, the story and characters are confusing.  I don't recomend this book.	0
10427	A3DDRESVCZISBM	Very light reading.  Would be good to keep around for those times when you do not want to be thinking to hard about your toubles.  Just a &#34;get away&#34; book.	2
10428	A2RFD97HHNZ6J0	This makes a handy reference book for those times when you need a nudge toward an idea. Recommended for writers of romance.	2
10429	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	I am so glad that this book was a Kindle freebie. It contains information that any knowledgable consumer already knows.I could not understand why some others rated it 5 stars.	1
10430	A1R5LRANFH1230	Ok, it has some interesting information that was worth reading. Yet, it did not inspire me to move forward to grow in writing. Not bad but, not awe inspiring.	2
10431	A388XBO57T6COX	what kind of story was this. please do not buy do not download for free this book or pamphlet is not worth it.	0
10432	A2I1FYC058CCN0	I was hoping to stumble upon some new information/techniques that I don't currently use. Seems to be more for people who are starting for square one, so to speak.	1
10433	AFKRKAZ0DRGI1	The 3rd book was too much. Too much story line, so much so it was hard to keep it straight.	2
10434	A3KKQIIVWKBRRG	Okay read. Some typos. The rhymes and the wording are weird in some places. There are better books out there.	1
10435	A10Z1GSQWC664Y	This story is not very exciting to me. It is an ok read. Fine for a long car ride if you have nothing better to do.	2
10436	A2O3MD7D7523V0	I loved this book, was well written.. wished it was much longer. Hope there is a follow-up full length novel in the making.	2
10437	A342FBV09E91NR	it's was ok...not what I thought it would be,plus the book is to short..not happy with what I paid for it.	2
10438	A2QQA7UASBHVE	I began to read this and it was the weirdest book I have ever read. Naomi Kramer isn't a book I would recommend.	0
10439	A5NM6JG4YBUQK	Was just getting interesting..super charged...BUT....way  to short of a story...personally I like the style,just need the story extended & draw in more characters..	2
10440	A2L6ZB2QSAP1I9	Way to decide for everyone what we think, believe and feel. However I can think for myself. I don't recommend this book	0
10441	A1A4QVX9RTCLVW	Short story porn. I did not like it and would not buy anything else from this author. No story line, just desktop  sex.	0
10442	A32CNAR2M4IH8L	Useless piece of writing.  Waste of time to even consider.  Skipped and jumped with no follow through of the introduction story line.  Total waste.	0
10443	A3F6C0W1YBAVY5	I found this book to be helpful. it provides a guide or path to get where you want to be.	2
10444	APWL5AL3V4RF	I liked this book for the fast-paced speed of the plot action.  The subject matter kept me interested to the end.	2
10445	A6H03FUEXBLRI	Sorry, I just don't remember the book.  Can't really critique it.  Probably not the books fault I can't remember it butI just can't.	2
10446	A3AZHL1OUAQ7HY	This was a very fast read short and to the point I am glad it was free I would have been very upset if I payed for this short read..	2
10447	AT7O1ONKZSY3X	I don,t know  what to make of this little book. It is the shortest of short stories. There is no end to the tale.	0
10448	AGSCRP77NV7QK	I should have read the brief description first. Not my kind of book. Overall though it wasn't badly written like some I've read.	2
10449	ANF130VALEOT4	Enjoyed this book. Wish it would of been a little longer though. Liked the characters, locations, and storyline even though it was short.	2
10450	A27QA7WBQ03RGO	The character development was weak, there wasno depth, it left too many gaps for the reader to figure out. Not enough backstory to make the current story worth involving oneself.	1
10451	A2B9C3FMYW18UN	This book is good but very short. You could put all these short stories together and I don't think it would make a book.	1
10452	A3TJL6EEPTDBAH	Terrible, a child could tell  better creepy stories, just really bad story lines, almost amateurish in a way, camp fire spooky tales that are made up.	0
10453	A3SRJ2UK1VRKM4	Am still reading and have now finished all available though Amazon and will wait for the rest of the series.	2
10454	A1TP0YYWWYTBP7	it just takes to long to get going and I just couldn't get into it	1
10455	A1TA5QYECZP1L1	Look out Seymour! The greenhouse strikes back. Fun short read. The Little house of Horrors will come to mind. Mild recommendation.	2
10456	A567CV1KKNALM	Save your money!  This could have been easily been written as a back story in the First Expanse book.  Worth a quarter if you can find it.	1
10457	A18GAQOX874RC3	I thought it was a bit weird for my liking, however I had to complete, as it was rather intriguing, a good one for a movie.	2
10458	A36Y8E1258CHLF	Can't believe Amazon charged money for this.  Can't believe I paid money for this!!!  Should never charge more than a dollar for these so-called short stories!	0
10459	A30J0XSBCCJAIV	Light fun mystery, Mixed up family, can't meet her bills and keep her electric running.Still trying to keep her business going.Shirley Ann	2
10460	A156KJ9JW44HLI	It was a nice read for a Saturday afternoon on the patio. Not sure I would recommend it to friends though.	2
10461	A3VOXY9KCR75ZB	really predictable, but okay story. I can already tell what the sequel will be about so I probably won't end up reading.	1
10462	A3QXRC3LSY6Y2D	This is a pretty simple book, and a quick read. most of it is pretty basic, but if you are just starting out it could be useful.	2
10463	A1M8BWGDXA9VRE	This is a Stupid ass book with a stupid ass story line. Started out ok, and then... This was just too dumb for words.	0
10464	AF97VNN4TRE7W	I'm only writing this because I really can't remember what the book was about. Not a good advertisement and while I enjoy Christian books, this one left me cold.	0
10465	A32H1BHZBPMU6F	I enjoyed the Ravynne sisters escapades.  It is a pretty typical ghost story with a few good twists.  Did not really care for the ending.  Seemed to be unfinished.	2
10466	A2W8D69TYD5XFW	Really enjoyed this insight into Boricio. He's bad but he also has a good side. Hope we see more books on him in the future	2
10467	A3A7FF87LEVCQ1	There is no conflict, no drama, no character development in this short story.  Other than promoting another work by the author, there is no reason for this to exist.	1
10468	A1E62Y2T3AQD6S	Hello, I made it through this story by the whiskers on my chin.  Some books have it and some don't.  This one just didn't do it for me.  Thanks.	1
10469	A1N2PY3PL8QA7W	The action was hot, but I would have liked more of the medical stuff.  Overall I think this was pretty good.  Needs editing.	2
10470	A1JF6J4BWXSFLP	This story was unexpected. It was funny and sexy. I liked the story plot. It was definitely a short read.	2
10471	A9DAPOWABZW2E	Not enough story too much sex. Really not to much character development . Was surprised because this author is much better then this book shows.	1
10472	A2HPEYWJ6WXSX9	have not had a whole lot of time to review the cook book but plan on doing so soon as I have time.	2
10473	A1MABOUDKTRA23	This novel rated as Ok as it wasnt bad it just didnt get me into it as much and was predictable so only a Ok rating	2
10474	A2UG2DKXE0XHSL	I really expected this to be a much better showing of dulce de leche. It was okay but because I know of this product I was not impressed.	2
10475	A1MP1YEQIC1RFW	I felt like I was cheated because the book is too  short. But it was a good book anyway should have been longer.	2
10476	A243FA8XGHI63J	I liked deception but not this... I really wanted it but couldn't read 4 chapters then the last chapters just couldn't  get into it. That God it was free	0
10477	A0653433291SMBQM1ZO1H	The story line was good but it contained to many f word and p word to be totally in good taste.  The writer should consider revamping the love language.	2
10478	A2DWN2MQYWKGNX	The characters were cute and had some humor but the story was not interesting enough for me to finish the book.	1
10479	A1H0J4Y7FIPL7N	A okay read with lies and secrets. I didn't see the twist,but it was a good one. I like how the author worked in forgiveness.	2
10480	A1E3QC0C1ODF2N	Cute story and great illustrations in this very short story for young people. A story of courage to believe one can do anything if one thinks one can.	2
10481	ARNVTOUZSPP0G	The story was fine, but just a short story. I was expecting at least a short novella. Ok if you get it for free, wouldn't spend much for it.	2
10482	AB499ZXFRAO0J	I liked the idea of the story but it was so short I thought I just got a chapter or 2.  Kind'of sorry I paid $2.99 for it.	1
10483	A25IEVGHWNJ26U	This book is just a typical story of boy meets girl and boy marries girl.  Nothing more than that. Not much depth to it.	0
10484	A2LTWDM0TJAKOS	The book had some pages missing.  I would probably not buy this book.  Perhaps the missing pages could be the link to hold this story together.	1
10485	A192C29DJ6Q7V9	I'm older so this book was just for fun but I enjoyed reading it .I have to write  more for this to be subscribed	2
10486	A2DVN8O4NYMZ3J	Too much time spent on the tiny details, but enjoyable nonetheless.  The beginning and end are the best parts of the novel.	2
10487	A3797C19C6RU0V	Guess she is doing fine with her prayers with the Lord, but was hoping it would reveal more insight toward my relationship with the Lord.	1
10488	A1I7VZM3LCG33M	Would have been an enjoyable book if the characters and plot were better developed and the sex de-emphasized.  The frequent detailed sex scenes were distracting and unnecessary.	0
10489	AB74YH05XNGUL	the story starts out with great promise , then goes downhill from there. this book basically is raiders of the lost ark meets x-men.	1
10490	A3W135PIP2P26P	very interesting take on the soul of a vampire the romantic portion was cute but predictable after a short bit in	2
10491	AKBB1CD18RLZ9	Silly me, I read the whole thing and no it didn't improve. Cindy was highly annoying and the whole story was just plain silly...silly me.	1
10492	A1SE75DRBHL1K7	Not really how I expected the book. If your looking for simple jokes for your child, this is the book for you.	0
10493	A3PGHYV2XJ6WQE	As with most Kindle book's proofreading is needed. The story is okay, I just did not think it was great.	2
10494	A25MBJPNN2MW3F	Its pretty and sturdy but I do not like the price.  It was too expensive for such a simple case.	2
10495	ALKWXV9QFSN01	Otherwise it did its job until one of my kids took off with it. But if it says 5 ft it should be 5 ft.	2
10496	A30K9MEPFESK61	A few typos but not bad. I didn't like how quickly Trent got over and forgave Gage. It seemed unreal to me.	2
10497	A3IQ5HVRNPSB0X	A nice story line with likable characters. I liked having the male and female point of view throughout. However this one was not as emotionally affecting as the first.	2
10498	A1VIR960IWHK07	Short story the title sums it all up.  Good writing and one you don't have to think too hard about to keep up.  Happy reading!	2
10499	ALTC2XJE67A7Z	Good book,stories were good I enjoyed them,a lazy read,not keep you up nights,but a good solid read,I enjoyed them a lot	2
10500	A3VSHXUY4O0HS9	I was not very impressed with this book. I saw nothing new, and I don't think I will continue the series.	1
10501	AKJ9OZUSZUFIL	I picked this out of a sale list not expecting much and was so happy to find this a pretty good mystery.	2
10502	A2PKYXWGORVF1C	Didn't like this book at all. The beginning was very boring, I didn't even finish it.Deleted it from my Kindle	0
10503	AGWWP06T111P6	Just eh	0
10504	A1BXGZO9ZF111Q	I definitely think this book and the first should have been one book instead of two.  I liked them, probably won't read them again though.	2
10505	A1IUG7O26R94DZ	Good story but too many loose ends.  Hated the ending,  what happened to sister and son?  Did they reunite or survive?	2
10506	A38ZC7NCQG1A14	I enjoyed this book a lot but I found it muchly to short. This being said some things are better left short and sweet	2
10507	AQQSN72G1I1B6	This is a fun little book which will keep you entertained but it's not a book I would normally purchase. I think I received it free through Book Bub.	2
10508	A8NA1HC5D8LQB	This story was a little far-fetched, with a predictable ending.  It was a quick read.  Not sure if I will try another Truscott novel.	2
10509	AN7DH3488CURH	Could use some polish, and improved dialogue overall.  The idea is a good one, so stick with it.  This story could go far!	2
10510	AOJPWM50DDDKO	This people in this book definitely don't know the definition of loyalty. When money gets low people want to run for the hills.	2
10511	AF8QQML4FOM3C	I liked this book because it ended on a positive note for the characters as well as leaving room for a sequel.	2
10512	A1FOULNURM7W3U	Ciouldn't gt through the first chapter.I knew it would be about baseball but didn't thinkit would be ALLabout baseball. Yuck.	0
10513	A3AHUQDRYTVYWH	Even though these stories are kind of predictable I like them any way I guess I just like stories about the romance in the old west	2
10514	A1K0FBW4HUTGO2	This book only contained the equivalent to one paragraph of a normal book. For me, it didn't make much sense.	1
10515	A314ZRC4VKJYZO	After reading through the first, I was truly hoping this one would have been a little more put together. The 'suspense' wasn't really suspended, and the characters were bland.	2
10516	A17NFX9UYP7N9H	This is just a portion of the story. But there is an excerpt of the next book. Be sure to read that to understand this one a little better.	2
10517	A34MJSBR43FQN5	I'm liking this character Animal. Tech also seems cool, but they could have gave a little more. Glad it was free	2
10518	A1E7AFZP31VS8H	Not what I was expecting. Book is really good for those who need a guide in decluttering any room in their house	2
10519	A2CYXR2Z3J1RL7	I may need it in case of breakdown or trouble in the future.  Hopefully never, but it is a good insurance policy.	2
10520	ADU6LGFXOO4XF	Book downloaded with a bare minimum of information.  I deleted it soon after.  Go to pinterest and do a search and you'll find what you need.	0
10521	A2BOEXEA6ELVVN	Not as good as previous books in series but I do like Ms Driscoll's writing...just not especially the story line of this book.	2
10522	ANQY895AK5RS1	Very disappoint ing l. Tired of the repeated stuff even the same names for stuff, same themes boring technology. No imagination...	1
10523	A1VD2JTNCWY02V	I'm past the beginner stage of knitter so this book was not for me but for the new knitter this would be good with all the tips in here.	2
10524	ALTC2XJE67A7Z	Cute story,enjoyed it ,kept me I interested,will read more by this Author,good plot could of been longer,liked the ending very much	1
10525	AOJ39UV2UFA1	I downloaded this to share with my family over the holidays. We enjoyed the variety of questions covering holiday traditions, literature, and pop culture.	2
10526	AM302WMRBUCKH	I liked this book.  I would recommend it for adult readers who like a fast paced sci fi action novel	2
10527	A27Q7QKHCP20CX	I found the plot to be very contrived.  I know enough Bible to understand the thought process.  But, I found the plot to be contrived, forced and very unrealistic.	2
10528	A2GQN4KH1P6UC3	This book was very short but ok. Towards the middle/end of the short story I was and am very confused.	2
10529	A3A7DAC19FOY6H	It leans a little bit too far towards the health side for me. I was hoping for something a little more normalized.	2
10530	A1F6VYXBX59WI9	I thought it was a good short story.I have read all of Luann Ricebook's.I would recommend this book to my friends.Sincerely,Arlene LeMire	2
10531	A7D2CHGKQ517K	I gave it 2 stars rather than one because the case will protect my Kindle. Its keyboard never worked. Thats after constantly charging it.	1
10532	A3NMYEPWS6BU9M	A fun read with interesting details.  I would have liked more character development and not so much wrapping up of the bad guys quickly.	2
10533	A2E6AHFDJ3JBAZ	It's Dean Koontz, and he can certainly write well but who needs this short story - which is actually a prequel to his newest novel? I'm sorry I bought it.	2
10534	A3GXZHUXGNW502	Lead character was a slut. Couldn't wait for it to be over. Silly really. The writing was not very good.	1
10535	A39WYE2YM9GPX4	Two books to get to a brief stint on what happened to his girlfriend but very little on her mom.	1
10536	A2B31OV6ML11C6	Just your typical romance novel. Brighton Isn't bad at writing. Each if these stories are typica romance novels. If you like reading them, you'll like this book.	2
10537	A1G9641CCR2RRI	I was expecting more.  THe knife throwing scene was very small and then you get a recap of the book you've read before.  Should have been free.	1
10538	AVQG2AB66I7A0	The illustrations were cute but the story didn't really seem smooth and it didn't really keep the attention of my kids.	2
10539	A6T7P4K2DBBM3	If you are looking for a good telekinesis story, read Carrie or Firestarter.  Both oldies, butt still goodies.  Stephen King will always be the MASTER OF HORROR.	1
10540	A33UJC53W5BJPR	this was a pretty good story	2
10541	A2E3DABBJQMKL5	This book is not something I can finish.  The characters are pathetic and frustrating.  Leanne and Andre's relationship is over the top	1
10542	A26AH4MQ7NJGTX	I enjoyed this book, but I think some parts seemed a little too rushed and ridiculous. All together it was an Ok read.	2
10543	A1TX0G9YX0K6K3	Interesting and pleasantly erotic. The characters were well thought out and the writing wasn't done all that badly, however I don't think I'll be reading any more of this series.	1
10544	A2IKDJBPGCY19V	I didn't get it. The relationship in the story develops fast and out of nowhere. Not into character or plot development.	0
10545	A12RCE3OS1KFG9	Story is OK but I did not stay interested all the way through the book. I'll try reading more of her books when they come out.	2
10546	A29GC4U3MLY8VF	A good story but I would have loved a more in-depth view of the people involved. I was really getting into the story when it ended.	2
10547	A9URPLUUEJQAW	It was ok it seem like the author was young or a new writer maybe both but it could have been a lot better	1
10548	A1SNUFM32991XP	Still trying to finish up. I like it so far I just can't seem to finish it. All I can say is revenge can be a bloody mess.	2
10549	A2ZUQSFUAFU8XT	If you think Amanda Knox is innocent.  You will like this essay more than those who think her guilty.  Kind of scary how far the mob against her will go.	2
10550	A2GN3H3YY0XRZL	I didn't enjoy this as much as I had her other books-but I will continue to read her next books	1
10551	A30P0JNLQSBN7P	Average book. Some ok lessons. But overall a bit negative & then the character dies. I understand these are Aesops fables, but I don't think it is for young children.	1
10552	AO2POHF8GZF7A	I enjoyed this book. Especially for the price. Well written good character development an plot twists. Only slightly predictable. Wonder what happens next.	2
10553	A358GAM1Z9FOC1	I liked the story. It was really good. But the writing has a lot of mistakes and I mean a lot.	2
10554	A1L2ZLVB3PEAMS	I liked the story but had read it under another name before the kindle. I was a little upset about it being a remake.	2
10555	A15BNYZEJ78T0Q	nothing to write home about ok stories she ha s written better her earlier stories are just ok not more	2
10556	A1IMRQN25R166H	I didn't understand this short story and I didn't like it. It was just too strange and too graphic for my taste.	1
10557	AAJ181YPCE63Q	The title itself was misleading! I enjoyed the first and last short story. I would honestly buy part just to check it out.	2
10558	AYJAMRMQZ8B5C	I don't know why I insist on wasting my pennies and buying these few pages.  Please just wait for the whole book to come out.	2
10559	A04666331NYU0YWTDI5DA	I live to read about witches,and this book is great . It has it all the good witches and the bad witches and of course love.	2
10560	A18QXD6883JSTS	It wasn't the best I read and it was like it was rushed to finish which I don't really like in a book.	2
10561	A260774I0SANR3	interesting, but not particularly deep story. a little on the predictable side, not one I'll read more than once, which is my personal &#34;must have&#34; to get 5 stars	2
10562	A16STGQEB25C66	sorry but not like	1
10563	A10S049RIL1LY0	There are so many exercises proposed in this book that are reckless and potentially dangerous. Others are just the same old things.	1
10564	ATGSAW7SU6C56	Not my new favorite cookbook too many recipes that do not sound goo to me. Would not get this again.	0
10565	AA0ACNQ10WR4U	A short Jaci burton novella.  It was okay, but her longer novels are much better.  Still love Jaci Burton though.	2
10566	A18HP88HRONP9W	The story started as a slow dull story and remained slow but I was determined to finish it.  It had a good story line but was a force-myself-to-finish book.	2
10567	A1GQEH3S58URDX	This is a very tender love story. A short story with a diffidence. The editing or highlighted errors was distracting while reading.	1
10568	A30XM090FFPA9Q	Lots of information blended with mystery. Enjoyed this book and hope to read more by Deb Baker. She knows her dolls.	2
10569	A1QC6305QTQ8NO	I had a hard time getting into this story.  It was ok to me.  The author does too much writing.	2
10570	A257I0FHX9V7JA	Too much graphic sex and too much use of the F word. I thought authors had fairly good educations and use of theEnglish language. Sorry, but these didn't seem to.	0
10571	A2TEWY22GRGKCL	I found this mystery to be kind of boring, Maybe the subject matter just didn't i ntrest me.I don't think I would read another book in this series.	1
10572	A20TKFEXPG7UWB	Advertisements and pieces of books that is really confusing. The words are also really little too.It really is not worth it.	0
10573	AK18B9JHBG1TG	A good book but not as good as the other two. It ended up with a good ending but I didn't like the first half.	2
10574	A3UWTFF9RSZ7UY	This book was half fair and half terrible.  Stories in some cases ran into other stories and became a mess and some were just downright bad.	0
10575	A1DEBGLT05XK4O	My review title pretty much sums up my thoughts on this short story.  Thank goodness it was free.  The end.	0
10576	A1EZ1PKN7Q86CW	The story was good but I am not sure if I will read more from this author. The story was too short to be a really good read.	2
10577	ALFGUMMTD7M4R	I liked the characters a lot, but it's basically your typical romance novel.  Nothing exceptional, but not to worst book I've read either.	2
10578	A3JSQB8SX4R7QC	I found myself skipping through the book. While this book had more substance than the previous books, I was bored.	2
10579	A1D48PA49JRQM6	Nicely written, good love story but has some gaps. It was entertaining and funny sometimes, but still something is missing.	2
10580	AK5ETIYOJ5QPI	Too many incongruities, unbelievable circumstances.  A sniper is after her and she goes running alone? She says she loves him to his face and then hopes he doesn't know. Edit.	0
10581	A3D48ENE487GWO	This story was not very believable.  The story should have involved interaction with the London police to make it more believable.	2
10582	A217VNB3JD8MCL	Not one of my favorite books by this author. Did not like the fact there was really no courtship leading to their relationship. But still love the series.	2
10583	A2MJ03J7EHVSCI	This was real good, but he did not add  Math 24 -30 . This tells when Jesus will come back. But there are some verses that I did not have.	2
10584	A2EM6O6EAMREAV	Terrible attempt at writing.a real snooze Fest. Boring. Wanted to kill myself because it wouldn't end. Ive read better colonoscopy exams. Never write again, ever!	0
10585	A2VPJLZ62A2NH7	I love exotic romances!  This cover looks hot, but the story missed a lot of what I needed as a reader.  I would not buy or read again!	1
10586	A1Z833I3QX55LI	This was just too short. The story was good. It was just too short. It was free so I guess I can't complain.	2
10587	A2X41HCFG7JF94	Quick with a lot of heat. I read it in about an hour. Would be better priced at 99 centers instead of $2.99. Not enough story for the price.	2
10588	A24NR1Z5R91FEY	This story is basically the same as Blood of Half Gods. Just told a little different and really nothing new added	0
10589	A3VQ34Q8V0J9DW	I love the author's work and I love to start a new series.  This book kept me wanting to read more chapters than I wanted to in a  day. .	0
10590	A1JMSX54DO3LOP	Very short story that quickly captures the reader.  What is the plot twist? Is it paranormal, mystery, broken marriage?I enjoyed it but do not plan to re-read.	2
10591	A17U3B7EPE3AE	This book is a good short story.it holds your interest and remind s you of the GOOD and tough people that tamed our land	2
10592	A1TT2Z3LIRL4JG	To tell a story that could have been told faster.  Figured out the kickers half-way thru the book. Skipped quite a few pages that didn't add to the story.	2
10593	A3TCLX9ZVYXC07	I still adore the sweet and funny banter between this uber sexy couple. I found myself skimming the book though. I wasn't immersed completely. Also it was quite predictable.	2
10594	AAY1MMW26EXOE	Pretty good book for a quilting. Easy to follow set out is great, can't wait for my next project when I've finished the others	2
10595	A15CKAZM64OK9Z	These stories were weird! I mean really weird...the only book in this series that was good was the last two...the first four are crazy weird...Trust!	2
10596	AKOQRCCCNVRLT	Really did not enjoy this short story . Will not be ordering anymore short stories. Just did not get it.	0
10597	A3EMR6G0PQ6326	The grammar was so horrible that I could hardly make sense of it. I have one thing I could recommend.....editing. I will not tackle the next book of the series.	0
10598	A821SZEIA10CR	Not enough substance, no real plot, no character development. Not worth the time it took to read it. I would not recommend it to anyone.	1
10599	A1SPKCPR0BAZMY	These story lines and the dialogue in them are like what you would expect from cheap porn.my advice is don't bother	0
10600	A30JGY5ZUBH7SJ	it was ok, I downloaded it for free.  I would have been very upset if I had of paid for it.	2
10601	A2W4O46A77OA37	The Book is enjoyable, the story seems to be great, but slow. Great idea, but no closure, no transition that would take you to book #2	2
10602	A17ETBG254GGV2	good story.  needs to find a competent editor.  interesting enough to encourage me to read another of his stories.  author has lots of potential.	2
10603	A4ZGXKBX71V70	I don't like vampire books it was too fictional for me to get into, I prefer her crossfire series way better	0
10604	AE0SWDW5KZ1GE	I read this with my six-year-old. He liked it well enough, but the story was incomplete, and the illustrations weren't consistent.	1
10605	A2QD1N3R1UW7KU	Was not what I thought it would be, so I never even read the book.  Just not into any type of violence.	0
10606	A3RC9RHMXKWTRR	A nice short read. The historical setting makes the characters and plot  interesting. I would read the rest of the authors short stories.	2
10607	A1V0FYS3Z14M9S	Clinicl Judgement by John Egerton was an okay medical mystery. But, it was not the christian mystery I prefer to read.	2
10608	A1JSI79RADY2N	This cover did not fit my Kindle and was much to heavy for my liking. I reordered another cover that is much lighter in weight.	0
10609	A3C45WRBL8Y5I1	Lest favorite book so far! Boring! I want the cowboys back! Didn't keep my attention at all. Made me not want to keep reading!	1
10610	A3C713428J4MJ7	what theheck.would some one tell me where the ending to this story is.and why would they start the story the way they did.	1
10611	AI9Y3W3AJ4383	Sorry - I made it about half way through and had to quit. Not my kind of story and could not hold my attention.	0
10612	A75GM4KDDWQWI	I'd probably have to read this half a dozen more times to understand what happened and frankly I'm just not that interested. Very confusing.	0
10613	A7U593YQPBGE0	This was just an odd story and I never felt like I connected with it. It wasn't bad, just not something I'd read again.	1
10614	AFHUQMR769QGW	Nothing hot and steamy here. Not interesting enough for me to find out what's going to happen next. Kind of expecting more......	2
10615	AB21PLZLWGDE5	I loved the sex scenes.  But at times the story didn't flow well.  It could've been me. Overall ok read.	2
10616	A1EAMEGZI4WTLH	Too much of a teaser.. All three books should have been in two books.  ended too soon ...you're loosing me with this teasers	2
10617	A3HMXXXESLLVW7	Darn good reading.  Just the kind of story I like to read, every once in a while. Yes, I would recommend it to readers, as a good read. Alvis	2
10618	A3F0NBD1TNRGQ	It is a horror at every turn and seemingly  just no escape. A paradise island that turns into a place of torment.	2
10619	AJDJXHL159RQ0	Rather Interesting.I don't know if I'd give it any more stars than this, but I do lick itVery nice.	2
10620	A04369482NMU5EFHRYG5L	Interesting story it just is to short.	2
10621	A15T45VLAFQVTD	I liked the book enough and the writing was done really well.  I would probably not read the authors books in the future	2
10622	AFNO672MSWWX9	It's only 90 pages and I read this one in like 2 hours. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad. I liked her latest Hear Me better.	2
10623	A2D7DS1DGAWGVR	"Maybe ""Just One Night"" should have been a short story excerpt in  another book instead of a book of its own."	2
10624	A196KUYFVPRQ08	Abrupt ending.  I did not realize that this was just a short story.  Good message that all can take to heart.	2
10625	A02111413URCEN6HTGCK3	I just couldn't read the majority of the book yes it was somewhat helpful but I for some reason just didn't like the book.	1
10626	A20EXT9I9OSHI5	A book that starts off with profanity won't even be read by me. That just simply turns me off. I've removed it from my kindle without even bothering.	0
10627	A3UY1J54HSK9H3	This book is written in first person.  I do not enjoy books written in first person unless they are an autobiography.  Fortunately I only paid $1 for the book.	1
10628	AGEO9SDXFYYCQ	No substance to the writing.  I was really expecting more but it didn't come up to my expectations. I'm keeping hope alive.	2
10629	A34IXLUF9C6G1G	PICK THE STORY UP A BIT MORE!!ALL AND ALL I THINK IT CAN BE A GOOD STORY!!Keep it coming.MUCH LOVE!!	2
10630	A1O1MKXTTSGLOB	I couldn't even get past the first three pages, it's the most insipid book I've read for years. Thank God I didn't pay anything for it.	1
10631	A2GRMXRK7JAT63	The serial killer targets strong successful women, slowly torturing and humiliating them before finally killing them and leaving their bodies to be found in unsuspected places.	2
10632	A2D7QI059TVT20	I don't have this book. I didn't read this book. It was on my wish list, not on my tablet	0
10633	A3GLCV22X9S34N	This was a very short teaser read probably with more books to follow. So far what I read in this story book though was good.	2
10634	A293W2MU6STRGP	A story based in Afghanistan with characters from the military and a military plot gives time for landscape description and such.Dottie k	2
10635	AS3YP85NHDC2K	Not what I expected at all. You leave the book with pain and unanswered questions. Glad it was free! Very disappointing.	1
10636	AMNYQ2NB847XI	WAS not to found of this book did not like reading this book I did not find it interesting  not for me	2
10637	A1J2HFAH8EXK50	I only read the first 2 chapters I just couldn't get into it. It didn't attract my attention. Didn't really care for the characters.	1
10638	A35C7G6YUY6AHL	Like the series. Didn't mind this one, develops the characters a bit more, however didn't quite live up to my expectations	2
10639	A1CANESXXA8M1J	This was not the typical Amish book style that I am used to reading. Although it was good, I felt like it was written by a beginning author.	2
10640	AQ1HLMG5WR711	Started out good. But lost interest because it became unbelievable.. too many horrible things happening to one character too soon.	1
10641	A3VU722Y5C7RUK	Pretty good read... Not my favorite on amazon but good nonetheless. Going to read the second part to find out what happens but it's pretty predictable. Is well written though.	2
10642	A14NF4F4FBL5ZK	Best jokes? Really? Very few of the 'jokes' were actually funny. No laughing out loud to be found here, unfortunately.	1
10643	A2JTVE8NWW2X80	Of Dark Elves And Dragons could have been a great book, but it is very longwinded and confusing that is why I can only give it 2 stars.	1
10644	ASHX33A1334SS	Ok!I love romantic stories but this one was not for me.  I wrote this review several times but was unable to put into words what I felt.	2
10645	A36SR148DG0I2Z	This book was kind of lame.. Major jock likes younger girl. This &#34;jock&#34; is a bad boy whom comes from a rough upbringing.. I stopped reading it mid-way..	1
10646	AIX6ESOK3I8JE	I enjoyed the book, story flowed well but got a little detailed about things before moving on. I would still recommend this to SIFI readers.	2
10647	A22QBGVF2XTZST	But definitely a worthy read. Writing Witchy was a sweet short read and Thayer most assuredly put her stamp on it. Love Mz. King 's writing.	2
10648	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	This wasn't one of Jack or Blake's best stories. I did love the ending! I'll continue to read their books, but this is one book I won't be reading again.	2
10649	A28K797DYDEV07	Started off ok but went all the way left . Did't understand all the S&M made the book very uninteresting to me	0
10650	AOU94106K015G	I wasn't to in to this book I thought this book was going to keep me wonder what was  going to happen next but it wasn't.	1
10651	ASWOTI4BLT9JZ	Drama that requires diligence in ascertaining who is who and by whom each is impacted.  Few surprises in the storyline and those possibly solved in book two or three.	2
10652	A3HWE87ZW7JVR0	Started out like it meant to be a story. Fell flat on its butt and never got back up. Just ended. The end.	1
10653	A2UQBT1ONEWCMB	It starts out slow but picks up.  The story line was good. If you can skip many spelling errors. Will read the next book in the series.	2
10654	A1Y5GVGSU5CKEM	The author makes this z book realistic.  Not too many surprises.  Keeping up with the characters was difficult at first.  I was impressed by the realism.	2
10655	A2JD13PAIYPS33	The first book was phenomenal. This one wasn't as wonderful, but I must finish the series. Still witty and sexy if somewhat rushed at the end.	2
10656	A1B7514ASZYFZ9	I gave this story 3 stars because there are a lot of grammar issues... please get this story edited. Other than that good story.	2
10657	A1SOEVVJ8THYTX	Good reading bit slow but gets interesting so then u can't put it down .need to find out who did it	2
10658	A3MZF65ZEW1VV5	It was pretty predictable... but an okay read. I liked it well enough it just did not thrill me as a reader.	2
10659	A2BIFGERNRDLBB	Very slow read. Lost interest many times. Characters are ok but story line just isn't my style. Liked the cousin better than the main character.	1
10660	A2NX5UZYSYS5TZ	Needs editing.  More sex than story.  Still a fun author with good concepts.  I already downloaded the sequel to this one.	2
10661	ALPT8Y8L5MD26	A pretty good mystery about a prominent family. It had a very good concept and held my interest. For the price okay.	2
10662	AQLETMRNSI3N8	Sad this didn't grasp my attention, I'll have to read later.Can't read the others until I read this one first.	0
10663	A3MK7JXTC29UJO	What a waste. I would not read this  no matter how free. This author is better than this. But no more.	1
10664	AM7AGJEI3WM4X	I thought this book was lots of fun, however I kept wanting more information. Back ground information.  I felt that the story just could have been filled in more.	2
10665	A15Q2OYNX6DDKV	Basically it's an erotic novel that contains a lot about a dominating man. The story is written from the women's perspective.	2
10666	AGIGWFACFUTVC	Was very short though seemed like it really could have taken place. After the wedding the story rolled like two strangers wanting to make it work.	2
10667	AV4H0PUS03ZD0	Nice, easy read if you're into old-fashioned mystery romances. No intricate plots, just comfortable reading. Easy to stop and pick up again.	2
10668	A3UY9SL7V2EK9R	Main character Paige was pretty much an idiot. No one would believe someone wearing stilettos while running, climbing, ect during a reality show. Would pass on this book.	2
10669	AS33PK5BZOYGN	This is to broad, I like a book that says more than this.  There was very little substance.  I already knew most of was written	2
10670	A2VLI07SKBPB08	This story wasn't bad...not her best but I did like the outcome and so felt for those kids and their father.	2
10671	ALPT8Y8L5MD26	It is obvious that this book is written by an amateur who has very little knowledge of the Bible and the old testament.	1
10672	A22GGHISKRVAOX	The only scene I remember from this collection of books is a scene where a boy's portable Nintendo system falls down stairs and breaks.	1
10673	A1OTTUIRDXDV3P	I enjoyed reding this book the author holds you to his story but I found the ending a bit disappointing	2
10674	AK694XDKZFYR3	As you can imagine form the title, this is not a book but part of a serial (serpent in Spanish) programme - never-ending story	1
10675	A795DMNCJILA6	I did not find these crock pot recipes to be different or better than many other recipes and/or books that arereadily available.	2
10676	A10LR5LRY9SGI2	I am not pleased with this app.  I cannot even open it to look at it.  Deleated it from my KFhd7.  Very disappointing.	0
10677	A22A500ND6D4JG	Doesn't anyone have an original tale these days???  why does every author feel they have to write something so out of the realm of possibility to sell their book?	2
10678	A3FW06OAUGJ884	It was better than I thought it would be for a married in Vegas book. I would read more from Alyssa Kress!	2
10679	A35CR3WOCOZXTC	This was a quick read for me some of Alexx other books were better I would buy this again.. but it was ok	2
10680	A2B3NBSTICMTJQ	It wasn't my favorite biker book. it was worth the read but it reminded me another biker book out there just a little to much	2
10681	A223T998MPEEWS	It was a little boring wish it was a little  longer you wanted to find out what happened in the end	1
10682	A364Y954CYXV5W	Sweet, heartwarming, and a great example of opposites attract. City boy and country girl collide and worlds intertwine. Sweet read.	2
10683	A26N5Y8KQ51RGE	A real roller coaster ride of a thriller. Tough and smart reluctant hero, combined with bad guys you would like to see dead. Fun read	2
10684	A3NMO3K0QVQH66	Nothing to write home about, but it was enjoyable enough.Not sure if the 19 year old genre works for me.	2
10685	A3JLQB89L0JJGE	After reading av=bout Quinn and Orlando I was a lttle surprised by this book not that I didn't like it as I thought  it was really good.	2
10686	A2VHUAB7SS8PCQ	This guy has a lot of good ideas and this was a decent read to pass the time. This was a well fleshed out SF story.	2
10687	A1FWQEW02NE4QV	not what i thought.  the name of this book is very catching but it wasn't a good book to read	0
10688	A1OMNUD66UTHQT	i define my self as an average cook.  I CAN boil water and also make a grilled cheese.  In my opinion, only a couple of her &#34;tips&#34; made sense.	0
10689	ANXBIU1HP7BJD	I thought it was ok wished it could have been a little longer.Mabel will try reading more from this Author in the future.	2
10690	A34X9CGJCEE5Q5	The book was alright nothing of what I expected and would not purchase if your looking for a good read.	0
10691	A2HUVS5F8FQKBG	do not buy this book until the series is complete the book ends at a random point; it leaves you wondering why	0
10692	A3HMZ04VVRKSUC	It was a great way to wind down on Christmas night- it was like all the hallmark movies I've been watching all month	2
10693	A2HSAKHC3IBRE6	Not at all mysterious and very disappointing. Again with the relationship rambles. I don't think I'll be reading another of this author's books.	2
10694	AB5DP7AM479QJ	i am just started and this female bothers me cant stand her. i like trevor . lora leigh is much better	1
10695	A3NKKVAKGBWXED	A  very  good book IT was easy to follow and interesting to read. I t gives you an ideaOf  living conditions of that period of time.	0
10696	A1KUPTD530QBMV	interesting story, but doesn't give enough. way too short. wish It gave more about the woman's life with her husband.	2
10697	A1CJ5QY5NPS3TR	Kadisha & Mellow now know who set her family up. They are both Seeking revenge. It's sad to learn that someone her whole family trusted helped set them up.	2
10698	A3V130UA98TOBN	I never did get with this story and had force myself to finish it. If the book had any moral features, I.must have miss them.features	1
10699	A2Q95CRI8CONPE	This was a disappointment. It was free but it was horrible. Maybe it just wasn't my thing. Would not recommend.	0
10700	AL065011CQ82Y	It was a list and a short line or two about the porduct. Some of the apps I would never use but they are there.	2
10701	A33QSO9REE1E7J	This is definitely one story that should be expanded. There is so much story that is left untold in this one; however,although it was short it was enjoyable.	2
10702	AAFT7W37P20WF	1 star is being generous.  I love Elle Casey but this book was so horrible I didn't even finish reading it.	0
10703	A1A4TSG4NKWW16	Good story, but be sure to read Jake's story too. I like reading them both from each of their points of view.	2
10704	AZQSQSF2QI02F	Quick, sexy and nice touch to throw in varied places for sex. I liked how man watching sent them champagne and strawberries. Nice food play.	2
10705	A14WIDZ4GBET7A	I liked this book.	2
10706	A3VMTMRV7MCQ7F	I received this as a Kindle freebie. I could not get into the story. The beginning was ok but it was not enough to keep hold of my attention.	1
10707	A6TLD3SC0TAMQ	Quite a good story. I would have liked a bit more of the story back home. But it left you wanting to read Drew's story.	2
10708	A3E8YLPYJZ4BIH	I was quite disappointed with this book.  I had hoped for a truly terrifying read but was yet again let down.	2
10709	A34YHOJRRN6IEK	Story line keeps you moving and you somewhat get into the characters.  I wonder if there will be any sequels to this series.	2
10710	AKLEOQGYYBM7Q	It took me a minute to really get into this story but eventually it turn out really good.  I have a evil mother in law so I could really relate.	2
10711	A1IJFB4GEHU9IN	I really couldn't get into this book.  Plot was not interesting at all. Characters were not colorful. I didn't even finish this book. Just couldn't get interested in storyline	1
10712	ALUZ0GKPMOOBR	This box set did'nt hold my interest for very long. There were no surprises or any aha moments. I won't be investing in the rest of the installments.:(	2
10713	A3A7FF87LEVCQ1	All of these stories read like the author had an idea, sat down to write it quickly, and then was finished with the entire thing.	1
10714	A21F5COJA4QHQO	If I have to give a review I guess this book was a great filler to pass time. The plot was cute with the two love birds.	0
10715	A3GTOE05K01CUK	If it had a better story I would have gave a higher  rate, but it didn't seem realistic and it ain't my kind of story.	1
10716	AU8XJE29CF1RE	was a good start but I would not have bought it if I had known the story was incomplete .That's not right .I feel ripped off	1
10717	A26JPONZ69BAB3	it held my interest that why i purchase book 2 & 3 (they were nor as good)	2
10718	A2HC0BBMCBR1KW	Words fail me and I'm going to get my money back this author must have been high when she wrote this book	0
10719	A6TZKEKVXFCLJ	It was to quick to be over. There 's still un answered questions. I had moments that made me smile.	2
10720	A3MBKJG6MJAQUF	I really can't rate it till I have had time to read it! I'm sure it will be easy reading too!	2
10721	A15R4MT2DOX8LN	Beginning  story was  very interesting, then excessive preaching disrupted my views and concerns until the final chapters renewed my interest.	2
10722	A3OGEJML2WOEC0	This story is what they call a quickie it set the scene then get straight to the action.It is well written and interesting but too short	2
10723	A1RK2OCZDSGC6R	This could easily become a reality some time in the future. Nicely written with a good message in it  that fire is the  essential starter of life.	2
10724	ASRM6ZXM5EQS7	Short book, easy read. Good Christmas theme. I would have  liked it to be a longer book than it was.	1
10725	A3OB081N243NZS	Indeed it was ok at best. I hated the fact that the two main characters fell in bed so quickly. The storyline was not developed we'll enough.	2
10726	A3GPD8THZWY1F	Not much of a story. The first few pages laid the foundation for a plot but once the lovers met, it fell apart and before you know it, it's over!	0
10727	A3ANO8MT4P12D8	this was a good book that I really enjoyed. I felt like it ended okay but there were lots of unanswered questions.	2
10728	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Really quite typical.  Don't know why the hero is working though.  Not good n but not terrible.  Was a short read.	1
10729	A1O3X0MOWHE7M0	I really hate the books that are like teasers.  you don't get your money's worth.  I like the story, but Wong be getting further into this author	1
10730	A356K1MI6WSXPS	This book did not scare me, did not have me wondering and was not a good read.  I like Joe Hart but this was not his best.	1
10731	A2KBSC3QC43LU5	I was a little disappointed I could of been a little longer story. With more detail in the end. Hopefully there's more	2
10732	ADJHQB029LYJC	A good start but i am not yert convinced i wasnt to finish the series. I am sure it will continue to get sexier.  Hmmm.	2
10733	A2TBGPPA8T643P	I didn't particularly care for this series of books by Sandra Edwards.  The books didn't have any body, just plain boring.	1
10734	A1FTIFGCGWHXHV	This is a strange story. Very hard to wrap your mind around it and make it make any reasonable connection.	1
10735	A1FUH1O6FCTUYG	The characters needed to be more real.  The story had flashes of uniqueness, but would often slide into the same old vampire romance mold.	2
10736	A33CMOR9J7NTWG	boring characters banal story not much sex. waste of my time and money. won't be buying this author again any time soon.	0
10737	ACQCRFB5VWLDW	I found this book to be a bit slow and I lost interest in it.  Maybe, it was using the character of the child that threw me off.	2
10738	A2N7TEZI7SD84I	Informative but needs editing. Some repetition of paragraphs about the pledge are unnecessary  there was also repetition of some other details.	2
10739	A2CBHZ0KXUSPLN	Sweet story but where were the oh CRAP are kidding me moments. I liked Rockstar Daddy it had some suspense. But this one didn't.	2
10740	A1AGR3VCVEX071	The first book was great the rest just short stories may wait till all compiled in one book but not a bad marketing strategy.	2
10741	A3526B1LCK47X9	A very very short read. Never had time to fall in love with the characters really. You get a little background and just one night.	2
10742	A2AIIUWQ1TF1IP	This story could have been told in one book. That is why I gave it two stars. It was a fun light read.	1
10743	A2QZFM38IQ5WTA	average teen age stuff. miss labeled as I was was looking for a more adlut level. maybe to much to hope for in this gere	2
10744	A20SFN6NWCDBP4	It's okay. I think this one should probably have been written out into a novel. It seemed a pretty good premise for a story, but it really felt rushed.	2
10745	A2JFLX1FDSFF5C	"I am so Not impressed. There was nothing really ""creative"" about this book. I'm so glad it was a free download!"	0
10746	A2QBBMEHWZATA4	Not having been exposed to this particular author/storyline before, I was expectin a little more after reading the introduction at the start	1
10747	A38DIX88M5T94P	Don't bother.If this is your first book to getting into prepping, then go ahead, otherwise- don't. No disrespect to the author.	1
10748	A32AUTWA8MM81K	This is is too Christian!.  There is too much preaching for me.  I wanted the characters to come to life.  But, it was not a possibility.	1
10749	AJHL7N62ROBOQ	I wasn't impressed at all with the first book, or the second, so I will not be reading this one....	2
10750	AOMBISTIW8NT8	I enjoyed this book the plot was a bit twisted but good. I'm looking forward to reading part two curious as to the end.	2
10751	A3JQSKVJ342LEU	The story was realistic. Lots of erotic scenes to satisfy those readers who enjoy erotica.  Too many grammatical errors. Missing punctuation.  Who edited this work?	1
10752	A1IU4CSXQE7QWA	This is great for those that enjoys a Tru Blood kind of stories. A good variety.	0
10753	A2TDO3HSOCPZO3	Get kicked out by dad or give virginity to cop? Get this messed up idea of a trade out my life!	1
10754	A1T5GBOO56ZKNM	Blah. That's the best word for my impressions of this story.  A couple is supposed to meet for a romantic weekend, but nothing goes right.  Totally forgettable.	2
10755	A3N1IOJR7KUKWA	t was free with kindle, good reading. I enjoy something light to read quickly, the kind of book I like	2
10756	A1CWYZXIPX7O7Q	I just had a hard time getting into certain parts of the book, some of it was slow going.  The end turned out sweet though.	2
10757	AS0FT2XAXO428	I had trouble with this story,it was hard to put down but think I need to reread book 1 & 2 in order to follow it better.	2
10758	A1PYPC0SGTL8PV	This was three short stories that are sweet but not ones I would read over and over again. They just were ok	2
10759	A396VSPZJU54JU	Really liked the story and characters, but it was over much too quickly!  The story could have been developed into a great full-length book.	2
10760	A1EE05KGTY3VY6	Too short. Incompete. Good thing it only cost $0.99,because it's not worth no more then that. If this book was free,then I would recommend it.	1
10761	A13UTNVRSZKTL3	Sorry to say I was very disappointed.  The story was shallow much like the characters Hope and Murphy.  It wouldn't be a book I would recommend to anyone	1
10762	A2CHZIIR1H75CE	Didn't like the way the book was written. It was very hard to follow and I really just didn't enjoy it at all..	0
10763	A2NLCPHHWN6RN	I liked the new take on vampire lore but the story jumps around a lot. It was hard to keep up with so many characters, especially all the council members.	2
10764	A3C5J4IU4KMSWB	I usually enjoy Ms. Diamond's books....I'm sorry but this heroine was just silly to me with all her insecurities, childishness, and puerility. The hero had the patience of Job.	2
10765	A1GD6NBFLTUP5U	It was okay but I probably would not be buying more books from the author. Others would probably like it but it wasn't what I like personally.	2
10766	A1VFLS64W4M8BC	A simple, yet strange, short story. A quick, and amusing read. Not at all what I was expecting, but good nonetheless.	2
10767	APT76ENH025BJ	and not enough story and character.  I prefer plot to descriptive acts in the stories I read, so I did not care for this book.	1
10768	A2A7OERLNIBI68	This is not funny at all!!!!!!!!!.  This jokes are so lame, I can't believe there is a book with them in it	0
10769	A3ULR7XJF3C400	If you like me thought you were getting a full story, sorry not, just a short prequel to a series.	1
10770	A1BDDO9PX7RQRK	This book was free not as funny as her other book s . I felt sorry for Simone and did not like the  billionaire he played to many head games.	2
10771	A2MJ03J7EHVSCI	IT WAS A GOOD BUY, IT WAS FREE AND I ENJOYED THE STORY. sOME OF THESE STORIES ARE REAL GOOD.	2
10772	AM33M8N6FRYD5	This book is bad the hero and heroin didn't meet each other until the middle of the book.I would not recommend this book to anyone.	1
10773	A3VDYCJQOY7RHC	None of this plot made sense and was not at all believable. I continued to read, hoping it would get better, but it never did.	2
10774	A2T88JOVQN6FKS	Omg...... is there a part two? Cause the story can not end like this. Please tell me there is a part two.	2
10775	A5M7E1B2395HN	As far as romance novels go this one was just okay.  I'm not a fan of them to begin with and this one did not push me in that direction.	2
10776	AGQ8EE3TLYYSN	The first part is really good. Part two and three were OK. There was nothing wrong with them but I could not connect.	2
10777	AQDOP6M05RXYT	It made me feel uncomfortable when I started to read it, as you note I didn't finish the book. I also don't have the book anymore.	0
10778	A2HUVS5F8FQKBG	Don't waste your money it's two different stories that was too much in detail that had nothing to do with the other	0
10779	A1XX88SJ23WEOY	It was a cute story.  I liked it.  It is paranormal and if you are wanting to read an interesting but not highly suspenseful, this would be a good choice.	2
10780	A2ZTLL9J88DR0H	This book contained none of the first book for being a prequel it lacked alot of the character that i fell in love with in the first book.	0
10781	AGORW02J2U6ON	Great witty narrator than did not get on my nerves. no drama and pure fun fluff.  I will see what else this author has written.	2
10782	A979FFRPK4JQP	Great read, I just wish it was longer. At first i was kind of thrown off but as the story progressed I like it.	2
10783	A2MJ03J7EHVSCI	There was a lot of information that might help some one that likes old verses. Itdid not interst me that much.	1
10784	A2VPW6AUH2WJTG	I didn't like it and it did not hold the children's attention. It downloaded okay. I deleted it from my Kindle.	1
10785	AUV5269O5IYRE	Pretty short book and nothing here is really new for anyone that's been reading about cryptids for a while.  Pass unless you're new to the field.	2
10786	A3UL9HOG0I2SZA	I dont know why authors want to repeat the same information over and over. If you skip the repeats the book is pretty interesting.	2
10787	A3CUWRVAKGEFHL	I was expecting something different from this book.  It was not specifically devoted to cosmetics and the recipes looked difficult.	1
10788	AMWKG9LV4YTEE	I enjoyed the story, but it ended so quickly. I would recommend it for a short read for anyone who would enjoy reading about president Lincoln in a new way.	2
10789	A3GX65KVFVI8J5	Interesting to read to me it was predictable on what was happening through out the book knew the ending would be like it six	2
10790	A10TTS5EDIDQK7	I got this book because of the first one book.There were times when the story seem to lag behind.	2
10791	A8L8U6N8J2QSH	3-1/2 stars. A bit on the cheesy side. Perfect for those who like super sweet, fast-paced 2nd chance romances with a bit of spice.	2
10792	AZJA59OXKFPCM	I enjoyed this little love story.  Sweet and down to earth happenings.  Fast reading.. look forward to reading the other books.	0
10793	A3D9FCZJ4Z2AJX	Tried reading the story.  It attempts to channel Douglas Adams Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.  If you enjoy absurdist humor you may enjoy this book.  I had trouble staying interested.	0
10794	A1CTXFV36Y7P7Y	This book was a little too transparent for me and flat for me. I did not enjoy it at all.	1
10795	A1ZM4DHSCITGM1	Story of angry spirits that haunt an old plantation home that uncovers family secrets and brings love to the new owner .	2
10796	A13LERNQ8R7267	Loved this book even though it was to short the chemistry was amazing. Will look for more from this author.	2
10797	AVJ8RDNXA9DAU	Too much detail on the front end, then just dropped in the ending. Finished story, still looking for the rest of it.	0
10798	A2TCSSXBEZ9EY6	"And a nice little creative ""pick me up"" for when a person needs a nudge, and needs it in a hurry."	2
10799	A3DQU9H0AN61Q6	This was not a book to my liking I found it to be based on a very strange story very weird	0
10800	A1ZBWTGUCE3MF5	Silly and a really far out premise.  However, I did finish the book and it was fun.  Go ahead - willingly suspend your disbelief.	2
10801	AN2K1EOEPLWF3	These were interesting... some of them I didn't know.  I liked that they actually included the answers (made me feel smart when I found I actually was right!!!)  Ha!	2
10802	A2EF34SB5AVA3Y	Not as good as &#34;How to Succeed in Evil&#34;; conclusion was a let down.  It seemed as if the author just wanted to end the book as quickly as possible.	1
10803	AXLQ0FE5KYQFO	Don't have	2
10804	A1O8K4I0BLRW1Z	I tried several times to read this book but just lost interest and put it down.  Good luck with this book.  I hope you enjoy it more than I did.	1
10805	A2KE0TU7XK89QE	Really that's it, I expected  more.It was two short for the  price. I feel cheated, is there a part two some where.	1
10806	A3QRI142C6MEQ3	I enjoyed this book. it is the 1st book I have read by Sharon. I will read the next one in this series.	2
10807	A30G8PG6OMNVPH	I just did not feel any connection at all between them.  I would not buy any of the others in the series.	2
10808	A3F295WCZ3W3XR	Don't know what the other reviewers were raving about. This story was rather predictable, but it made my skin crawl and left a bad taste in my mouth.	0
10809	A1G3HM875EH7SV	Boring SO boring and it should've been more about getting custody back of their son instead of what Cassie and Josh are doing. I could've cared less about them.	0
10810	AZP7CQWQTM38M	Too short to have any substance.  Over before you even start getting into the book. If longer should be interesting.	2
10811	A20PRICNHQQLJD	This was a good book but needed to be longer it just ended short and left you hanging. I didn't see any other books that follow it to continue.	2
10812	A1G1B5UEDKOFJ6	This was a good book but it was too short. I felt cheated because of the length. I love Maggie Shayne	2
10813	AK0QESIF6VWGB	If a reader wants lots of sex in a very short book this is just the thing.  But if you are looking for plot or characterization this does not satisfy.	1
10814	AZMMFZKJB8PV6	very nice story, good characters,i wish it was longer, but there are other books, i'll purchase the next book. good job	2
10815	A2T1RGX2WEE5JK	stupid book and concept. he went in search of her to have her do what she's good at and tried to kidnap her just dumb	0
10816	A2VLKEC9VEM11L	This was a little wordy and s l o w pace for me but it has great ppotential to turn into a great series.	2
10817	A3HDX1FKIBK11G	Was disappointed with this one.  Old jokes, some not even funny, nevermind 'best'.  Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't recommend this.	0
10818	A12WR6RHQAHBIW	I only gave this book three stars.  It was somewhat hard to follow.  I will read one more of her books.  But not in this series.Thank you.	2
10819	A2B31OV6ML11C6	Book was strange. I liked the message, but he presented it in a way that was very confusing. I Don't think young kids will understand the dad's explanation.	0
10820	A1B31B5U84020M	Weird that it ENDED just as it began ,caught me off guard so it's l weird or more to the point WTF	0
10821	A2M1QYOWLBGRHT	I did not care for the story in this book.  It did not make much sense and had no ending.Thank you, anyway for writing it.	2
10822	A1EVY3RDX8GXCL	The total personality change of the characters was unbelievable,  inconsistent.  I didn't even want them to get together.  I won't read this author again.	1
10823	A2AMNFGI9SX63L	For a lover of Poirot this has all the necessary ingredients though shorter and less complex than some tales the author has penned.	2
10824	A1Q1INBE7NMOQW	I enjoyed it.  It is a companion to the Atlanteans series.  I think if you enjoy her writing you will enjoy these as well.	2
10825	A1UTPP3H1HFNRY	I love how it all came together. I am a sucker for a happy ending!  I am becoming a fan of this author.	2
10826	A1DC00T32U26HC	The story line was good and characters were interesting. A different approach to the vampire info. This book can stand alone.	2
10827	A3DDODLFTOS2PX	Helpful information, presented fairly clearly.  Most of the information inside is available online in different forums, although the author does collect and present it in a unique way.	2
10828	ADGEK87YMQEMS	Just another book that lists all these different things that you need to do.  The last thing I need is more things to do.	0
10829	A1WM8S5TSUO07M	When they say foul mouth  They sure mean it. The language adds nothing to the story. 4 pages was enough	0
10830	A22HZAR4J8P18X	I was hoping for the book to be longer. It was okay. Chocolate Kisses should have gone into what happens after that Valentine's day. Did they survive?	1
10831	AS80XLUGT7782	it was a light enjoyable read...not a lot of substance, but that's OK.  I enjoyed this freebie.  I would look for more from this author.	2
10832	A3TSGRWYKEO349	I ordered this case for a Kindle I bought my mom for Christmas. It's OK. I will be ordering something else for her soon though. The color was pretty.	2
10833	A3KSHVUN6WDQCM	Seemed rushed at the end. Lots of unanswered question. Potential for more. Jerry and the bartender for one. Shelley and Les.... check the show itself!	2
10834	A3AEUC1KPG4YBX	This book picked up right where part one ended, and again, poorly constructed. Good plot overshadowed by a bad writing style.	1
10835	A3CSQ87W32D6AP	I have never used this. How am I going to say good or bad about it. James S. Deaton ,,,,	2
10836	A1LL168GOYGQLR	These were missing something.  they were too short for the type of story they were portraying themselves to be. Potential to be really good, but just missed something	2
10837	AA5KGNW5PH5S1	I did not liked this story, it had some potential, but many situations in it were not believable. In many ways it just did not make sense.	1
10838	A303YZ142E18ZZ	I'm ashamed to have finished this....&#34;adult romance&#34;? Really??! Writing is juvenile.  If the groping was left out, fit for a 12 yo.	1
10839	A1ZLPE9JPLMTKU	it was a sweet and OK story with a lot of potential for me but somehow it did not reach to its optimum capacity to be a wonderful story	2
10840	A3H562YGOWSDI	I gave the book this rating because the story was not written with an edge.  The characters were not believable.	2
10841	A32PYP772QZE4T	This is the End 2: The Post-Apocalyptic Box Set (9 Book Collection) has Dead: Steve's Story + 8 other books for only 99. Why pay more? CAVEAT EMPTOR! http://www.amazon.com/This-End-Post-Apocalyptic-Book-Collection-ebook/dp/B00K31USUS/%3Ftag%3Dbg-u-20%26SubscriptionId%3D0DK6RX2SNSBPXDSWSNR2%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00K31USUS	0
10842	AZHMM0LZKKVYK	Good writing, keeps you interested just enough to keep going but never really sells the mystery concept. The sexual attraction between the two main characters is not believable.	2
10843	A179ZGXWA4RW3Q	Another sweet short story from this author. I prefer longer stories even if they are erotic and not romantic, but this was a good read.	2
10844	A1V4641875E27E	We all want a gardian angle, well her's was a stetson wearing devil. Can you say Alpha male and strong barbie. good read, fantasy for any woman.	2
10845	AEI54TGRBHLNK	I did not like it at all. It wasn't what I thought it would be and I did not want to read it any more.	0
10846	A31U8NJ6OF3RCT	This a useful book if you eat meat and have surprise guest to cater for who is veggie.  There were several repeated pages that were not recipes.	1
10847	A3CNWYFJPBXT2N	This story was very discussingThe author has a mental problemsTHE devil will be with youCutting out  tongue,eyes and limbsEvil	0
10848	A197W8MNF706HT	Ok... I was really looking forward to a hot read but it was only slightly lukewarm. Thank god this book was free. I'm disappointed.	1
10849	A22GHKAQRWC1WS	This was mostly previews of several books by this author.  Just &#34;teasers&#34;.  I didn't read them, so cannot comment on the writing ability.	1
10850	A227JITJQ8RKCH	Couldn't handle more than three chapters, poorly written, transparent story line.  Too predictable for my taste a waste of my time.	0
10851	A3H7J5POTR9TZW	This is the first book I read by Sami Lee. It's not much I can say it just isn't a story for me.	0
10852	A21IBKKR6F9YMG	Crazy. Not good reading and I never even finished it! Hate to be so negative but oh well! Good bye	0
10853	A1OJ1Z6EWH02TW	not my type of book, don't even know how it came on my kindle,must have been from a friend using my kindle	0
10854	A3HOIKV9DVCV40	I had a difficult time reading and understanding the story. It did not draw my attention or hold it for that fact eithet	0
10855	A2XKPFGMS7ZV12	Predictable, wordy, stilted dialog. I skimmed through it to,see if it got better but it just reinforced my impression that this was just a rehash of hundreds of Harlequin romances	1
10856	A1WP3TE89YUEIV	This is all pretty much common sense. Someone without any might get some benefit from this reading. I was completely bored after the 1st chapter or so.	1
10857	A393MWGE4IOGU7	Thought it was a little gross.Ending was not good at all.  Not sure what would have improved it.I usually love to read Karin Slaughter books.	1
10858	AONGEEDNS14F5	A very short explanation of chapters,not a story at all not worth wasting time on,vampires, vampire king,vampire princess planet Neptune that's it	0

10861	ALSBU9298L34S	Did not like this particular magazine on Kindle.  Much prefer to have paper in my hand with full size pictures and ability to write notes on pages.	1
10862	A2OTN8QJSVZ68W	This was way more gory than I expected.  Perhaps fans of brutal and graphic violence would enjoy this kind of story line, but it left me feeling nauseous.	1
10863	A2JLDAB8BY2L6Z	Story was ok but lead character was so absurdly stupid it totally detracted from the story for me. Really, who acts this flaky?	1
10864	A18K4TMJWIZ9IB	This book was a total let down. And the price what a shame . I don't know what to say its like a repeat of part 2	1
10865	A328NAIFPPXQCT	This was crap in my opinion this was too unbelievable and juvenile at best. Glad it only cost .e $1!	0
10866	A3D2FLC4Y6OP9A	Undeveloped confusing plot and characters. Had to stop reading, too awful. Was written at a 1st grade reading level. Burn it.	0
10867	AIDB9K03OEC27	This is a story of slavery in the South prior to and into the Civil War told from an unrealistic romantic point of view.  Quite disappointed.	1
10868	AQVGSI84SR40K	The characters weren't developed well.  It read like it was made for juveniles.  Just didn't really care for the book.	1
10869	A3G8BXBYLOX9WK	The story was not develop enough, it feels slightly rushed.  The characters are not develop and there is no background given about the main character Elizabeth.	1
10870	A2663EMQ257KPZ	. Perhaps its ok for someone who knows nothing about the history of Great Britian.Do some research before you arte.pt to write or edit another book	0
10871	A3HBUORS8GLI4G	You can almost write the ending yourself.  The descriptive sex  was good.Needs more of a plot to keep interest flowing.	1
10872	A32O6IYBGO9RDT	If you are a kid you'd probably enjoy these stories; especially the great pics. I'm elderly and they just weren't for me.	1
10873	A1N7HQ1U337JJP	Rot is the word, could not get into this book at all, stopped after 3-4 chapters as could not force any more down.	0
10874	A2EE2BP1FHO0D9	The problem is the story, the problem is the premise, the problem is this whole series.  Save yourself, if you haven't bought this, don't do it.	0
10875	A66RRZQDJC7N0	Very poorly written.  No passion etc..  Dull, no life to main characters at all!!.  Did not enjoy it at all.  Sorry!!	0
10876	A1PH97IIAG6IX0	I found the book very boring.  Too many descriptive words just to fill many many pages.  Didn't even finish reading it.	1
10877	A25S0PFK8RB0HE	I suppose that this wasn't the book for me. I was highly confused and incredibly bored. Sorry. Just not a fan.	0
10878	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	This book is certainly different and slapped together like bacon in a pan.  Not my idea of a good read or any read for that matter!	0
10879	A2P3BNNPUG6GXI	This book was kind of messy it was all over, my opinion is that u should've focus more on zo and sky instead of the rest of the people	1
10880	A11H2KC04C0464	Did not like this book, and it is very short. Would not recommend it. I like something with a little more of a story.	1
10881	A124LGB9NCLVUQ	Overall it was ok.  Not totally impressed.  Shallow writing however not a total waste of time.  I was hoping for a better story.	1
10882	AYFWWK1R7MNWB	the chemistry wasnt there for.me.between the two characters.  the dialogue was too.simple. I just didnt enjoy the story.  I it was.only 99cents so.I put it.on my finish reading.shelf...	0
10883	A2VHMJHJ6VG6RX	Couldn't get into it.  Found it very slow.  I also didn't like how it was written.  I could not get past the beginning of the book.	0
10884	A2LF6KGOA6GQ8O	No plot, just a lot of meanderings that weren't tied together with any kind of cohesiveness.  It was also depressing and slightly revolting.	0
10885	A1FN57Q42QMH9L	it made no sense and it was so dull to read that i lost interest in a few pages in	1
10886	A15FAG86UWEUJV	I've read another from this author and enjoyed it. This book might have been good but its obvious the editing was rushed through.	1
10887	A16PVIL5VY02M8	IT`S LIKE EATING A MAYONNAISE SANDWICH, BETTER THAN PLAIN BREAD, BUT YOU REALLY WISH YOU HAD SOMEMEAT ON IT.	1
10888	A2SKQ2F1H8OUWP	For me this was just a mindless peace of pulp fiction.Weak plot.Not very likable characters.And now this software requires this line to stop the nag screen.	1
10889	A18LHLOK3OZN3W	Childish and boring, this reads like it was written by a teenager.  Definitely not worth reading or spending your money on.	0
10890	A25CP6UY1I2W5X	Could have read more, but kept busy trying to follow!I know it was listed as &#34;short story&#34;, but much too short for me.	1
10891	A17HXR5IMGZNO0	I so wanted to like this story. I gave up on it when the British woman was trapped in a tree with her Slavic tormentor.	1
10892	A3EPSATLEMFL9K	Not my favorite read. Not saying someone else may enjoy it. I felt it wad a slow read and I lost my attention.	1
10893	A1O8K4I0BLRW1Z	Great!!!!!!  Book I've read in a long time.  I have got to get the rest of this series. I love it.	0
10894	A33COFFCC5DKL8	Of her writings.  Very surprising, as l am a fan of hers.  The pace is slow and the plot just meanders along.	1
10895	A12JL2NDDB7HJV	I kept waiting for something to happen, to grab me.  Nothing did but a lot of narrative and description.  Norman is boring and Brian manipulative.  Didn't enjoy either.	1
10896	A17FERG69CTZJN	This was more like an entry into someone's diary!!!  Complete waste of time!!  I would not recommend this book to anyone in its current form!  No substance at all!	0
10897	A3MXYC7PSXT8CX	The light reading, extremely good during vacations make this a good book. Not a book you need to think too much while reading it.	1
10898	A1OPQWCVFOGP6I	"but it felt kind of ""matter of fact"".  I think it would flow a little better if there were more descriptive information."	1
10899	A3A7FF87LEVCQ1	This predictable story is clunky in style.  It reads more like the outline for a work that the author means to return to later than a fully realized short story.	1
10900	A1NDPQQT37PT70	Not really a book.  More like a tease. Therefore I felt disappointed. What little there was to read I enjoyed but nothing was resolved.	1
10901	A1ZCEJEA67P6DE	Not good either. The price point is way off too	1
10902	A3801AFH5JO56U	This book was also young and dumb perfect title description. Will not keep the interest of an avid reader over 30. Just my opinion.	1
10903	A2K7H6OEXM8NJV	not a bad story, I just didn't find that it had any surprises for the reader at all. from the first page you could easily guess what would come next.	1
10904	A110D5HIO6S2XG	This took all of 10 minutes to read and I paid for it!  It was a prelude at best.  I am sure the other reviews are from friends.	0
10905	A1TJ89PLPSTWPL	"I started reading ""How to Distract a Duchess"" by this author and knew it was familiar within the first 2 pages. It's the same as ""Distracting the Duchess."""	0
10906	A2VRNG0L2WKG50	At times the writing seemed awkward and I found myself re-writting sentences in my head.  It needs a lot of editing to make it flow smoothly.	0
10907	A15OVY0KVCTOPO	This book was truly a disappointment, especially from Sylvia Day.  I felted like I missed something.... maybe a book or two in between. A waste of money.	1
10908	A2QQ3NQ70O25EE	Very few illustrations and small, tight print made this version of the classic unusable with beginner readers.  Free is not worth the wasted space in storage.	0
10909	AGPA00ILFQHZW	I read enough of this book to know it wasn't for me, but not enough to really judge it.  So please ignore this and decide for yourself.	1
10910	ARHYU0IMJFOS5	I wasn't impressed with the book.  I know it's got good reviews. I don't want to give the plot away.  Just not for me.	0
10911	AX5U61WS31VM2	Couldn't get past 11 percent.  The grammar was terrible and the writing juvenile and stilted.  Constantly changed from present and past tense in the same paragraph.  Just not for me.	1
10912	AM83X6ILO2US1	Slow start not much going on until the end.Slow start overly descriptive. Finish was OK. Would not recommend this book.	1
10913	A1FWBFWUI83YDD	Too short i want more from a book. When i read a book it want there story of the people this book gave very little.	0
10914	A36BBZOCYTMHN	Juvenile. No plot. You have to purchase the whole series for the full story, and even then you go What?  A gimmick to sell books, but it doesn't work.	0
10915	A2BYUZ068UD2CY	Didn't really do anything for me. I thought a lot of it sounds pretty cliche with cheezy dialogue. More than one eyeroll was produced.	1
10916	AWYL75ACWOM7H	I am not a science fiction fan, so could not get into this book.  I could not finish, had to put down, but may be only my dislike for sc-fi.	1
10917	A39WYE2YM9GPX4	Same drags on.  The only New to this one is the last page.  Waste of time could have skipped this book.	0
10918	ALQ12P6M6FUTG	Short story that includes a sad twist.  I enjoyed it and was hopeful at the end.  A few steamy scenes to tantalize you.	1
10919	A35UTF9HZE62XO	I've tried twice and can't get into this book.  I'm reading a series now; when I;ve finished will try again.	1
10920	A32AUTWA8MM81K	No thanks.  Making sex a constant overly open activity.  Makes it an activity instead of what it is.  No thanks!	0
10921	A1Y9PUN1Z2N2KD	horrible, low cost but also very low qualitythe stiry , the characters and so oni tried to go on reading it but it was impossible	0
10922	A1SN9FKXPPF080	Not at all what I was expecting.  But, ok.  I might try another one in the series.  Kat is NASTY and tough.  Which makes up for a lot.	1
10923	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	Couldn't get through it	1
10924	AG8IB3QLKLWK4	If your asteroid was owned by Earth and your nation wanted to declare freedom, what lengths would your citizens go to? Shades of American Revolution? Sabotage?  Worse?	0
10925	A1E33ER4JG5B11	Glad I did not pay for this.  Waste of five minutes which is how long it took to read. Not up to her usual standards.	0
10926	A386GLFIO8OH2	This book started poorly and went downhill to the ending,If I had not been an optimist I would have quit the book prior to the end.Billy	1
10927	A1CFFHC9POPE9Y	This was a confusing tale of a naughty boy. It was a confusing silly story about the tooth fariy.I did not like itJerry	0
10928	A3LOFPYSQDFHTF	I really enjoyed the suspense of the novel, but it really let you down in the ending. It fizzeled at the end.	1
10929	A36JELIH955MWD	mindless sex nothing else and not really good enough even to spend what little the price is for the story	1
10930	A1M10ECS3TRVR9	Extremely short. Didn't realize prequel to series. A real teaser. Will have to get set in order to fully review.	1
10931	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	The only thing good thatI can say about this story is that,it was free.Ms. Smith is an award winning writer.Howevershe has scored a miss on this stupid story.	1
10932	ATBHK0K09VEYM	why this was ever put under lesbian fiction is beyond me. A story of sex that has no story line that you cant see through. It was boring and tasteless	0
10933	A2JN2PMTXMSQIV	Blahhh. Typos, jumpy story line. Superficial characters. It would have been great if there was more cohesion and depth. The main character was just not my favorite.	1
10934	A25JOQV5JVIILU	Just did not care for this book, mostly useless, 2 recipes I might possibly make, many recipes contain ingredients not readily available.	1
10935	A18K4TMJWIZ9IB	I really don't know what to say about this book. This book was like blah till about 75% then that's when the story picked up then I was over	1
10936	A1TMB67J77UTIN	I found this book boring with a very rushed ending.  Unfortunate as I was really looking forward to reading it.	1
10937	A51YXQM8AT5U3	not to impressed, had a hard time getting into the stories, everything seemed kind of amateurish, would not buy another book	0
10938	A15H7ORJ0AE0J9	The old english was a bit slow to read.0K OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK .	1
10939	A2NHFTXXPAS3N6	This is a good book for beginners... Such as someone who has never had any experience with plants... not the book for me.	1
10940	A28REJAM6899K8	Not enough to hold your attention. Moved slow. Expected so much more with the title. Maybe another story will be better.	1
10941	A1W39WEZWIZKKY	Its was just a repeat of a few chapter in a book I already owned. Made to fit the &#34;NA&#34; description. rip off!!	0
10942	A1TT2Z3LIRL4JG	But the writing was simple. Detracted from the heat of the story by grammatical and spelling errors.  It was nice that the main character was able to let go.	1
10943	AT1FQ3R1EXO0Y	Nothing much new, just very routine combinations of cans.  A couple combinations I will note down to remember & fiddle with.	1
10944	A287L6VSBTI66U	To short I wish it was more to read. I love Kyla but I could of been more then her crying every minute	1
10945	A3CM8GD4R2HILN	Not worth the money!  Little to help other than some strong motivational phrases and warnings.Some food calories but no real recipes	1
10946	A18J6LPBVZ3CI0	While I couldn't find any grammatical or spelling mistakes on the first (reading) pass, there was just no excitement, no crescendo to the plot.  Disappointing indeed.	0
10947	A35UTF9HZE62XO	Nothing new or interesting to me......of course I've been cooking meals for 56 years...maybe that's why - Nothing in the book I was interested in cooking or eating.	1
10948	AD52F2SG6EJ3X	I do not recommend this book as I found it not very well written and thought out. The book seemed rushed and unfelt.	0
10949	A1XARHZT4E4WAX	I only read a couple of chapters.  Too much filthy talk which I do not like at all.  Not recommended for my Christian readers.	0
10950	A11TR2XF6H9XG0	Every success or triumph tarnished, and foreboding the next tragedy or atrocity. Wallows in human weakness and avarice. Ended as I expected, no surprises.	1
10951	A2XKSDE58B33AC	Starts of good, but is predictable in the end...I liked the male character. Maybe the story is just to short...Conclusion: not for me.	1
10952	A1QAJ9HCMPPLPC	I expected more of a thriller and more suspense. I didn't know it was so much romance and too mushy for me. This is my first book by this author.	1
10953	A2CBOVOOK3Q6D4	I was kinda boring. The word and emphasizes being gay way to much in this story. You do not need to repeat gay after every other word. It was annoying.	1
10954	A3CM2NXPOWTL3N	This was the weirdest, most nonsensical  plot line I have ever read.  Was quite disappointed.  The whole story made no sense, simply a farcical prop for gratuitous sexual scenes.	0
10955	A25P1Q4JL31KUZ	This book started out pretty good but deteriorated real fast.  I honestly don't recommend wasting your time to read it.	0
10956	A332F4S44LYK26	No substance to this, just a string of observations.  This could have been a valuable piece from someone with extensive experience	1
10957	ANTQCREZHGIER	Maybe I got lost in the what was meant to be funny but I seriously didn't get it at all	0
10958	A3KR3N21N470FU	This short story just didn't have much of a plot.  Just a waste of time.	1
10959	A1VRD8L02M7BQJ	Not a book. Only a chapter of 16 pages. Too quick. Was free.good story but I'm looking for books not chapters.	0
10960	A45D4VIWYMK37	So I have been waiting for the third book, but no way in hell I'm paying $9.99 for 154 pages.  The author lost a customer on this one.	1
10961	A3MP7EPOWO191I	Sorry, this book lost me in the elevator.  It was just to smutty for me to believe in it as a romance.	1
10962	A3IR6UYI01Q26A	I couldn't finish this one, and that's unusual for me. Found the plot hard to follow and the writing too simplistic to enjoy. I had hoped for more.	1
10963	A48NQ7XDV1PLN	This is the worst excuse for a Kindle book ever. I have never been so disappointed in my Kindle experience.	0
10964	A1B5Q6MP6EW4D2	Entirely too short to form a real opinion. Not enough of a storyline to make this an actual story. Disappointed	0
10965	A9YLO7QVIGGU1	Vinegar has always been good for cleaning.It is making the sour things that I love.Even on  salads. It tastes good.	0
10966	A15NZD5WINDQZM	Under developed characters can ruin a book for me and I am afraid that is just what happened in this book	1
10967	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Short again.  Not that I wanted any more of it.  Don't pick up strangers.  Not reality where I live.  Not terrible though	1
10968	A3BFWAWKQCSG76	Erotica ... you like the main two characters .... friend is a bit crass.  Too short of a story for me.	0
10969	A1DO8T1NU96AF0	Not what I expected it to be. Have already deleted from my Icloud. After Allegiant, I would not have ordered and wasted my time.	0
10970	ARMZUNUSAZJZG	not much meat here. The book is mostly a sales pitch, sound bite for his other books. Marketing the Possible.	1
10971	A1A7TJQIWPOGHQ	This book was juvenile! The writing, the dialog, everything. At a cost of 2.99.  Get real.  This should have been free with a money-back guarantee! Don't waste your time	0
10972	A15BQU0BRFNAS5	Not as good as the last story. Didn't gel for me...no flow or believable connection. Hope she gets better not worse.	0
10973	A1PSE8FEIWY221	The book was okay for a free book. However, I felt like I was reading a summary or prologue to a bigger story.	0
10974	A1CYMUAHPWCX0P	This is the first emergency preparedness book I've ever read, so I did learn some things. But the book is full of poorly written material.	1
10975	A1BYJFRK1CH4SD	only mildly funny. The ending was obvious, but it is a romance, so I don't know what else I expected.	1
10976	A1WH604DF7NI7J	Not anything I hadn't already read on Pinterest. Was really looking forward to having my socks knocked off, but not with this one.	1
10977	A3RG118D4XU2UN	could not get into this book so did not finish it. felt that it was a bit too girly with what one was dreesed in etc.	0
10978	ADX7UR2NMU6K	Funny how at the end the author gave a preview of the next book &#34;The Garbage  Collector&#34; hope they come toss this book in with it.	0
10979	A7B4PUPRC5IEO	Hard to get into. Rather dark for my tastes. If you just like werewolves or suspense, you'll prolly like it.	1
10980	A3HOA380TKCYWF	Too many sequels. Tire of reading about the same character. The characters have not evolved even in book 3. Starting really irritate me!!!!	1
10981	A26RM3D29VCYI8	Wish I wouldn't have bought this just when the story takes off it is over..... Not worth the money you would spend.	0
10982	A3V3OE9BRKSE35	I did not finish  I like her paranormal books, why I TRIED this oneThe sexual chemistry between them did not seem normal for 2 guys	1
10983	A43ZJNK7KCQN1	It was really slow....it was the same thing over and over and a very predictable ending. To be honest, it was stupid.	1
10984	A2TUH0Y4KUWM17	This is not a story. Not worth the download at all. Waste of space on my icloud. Fair warning to all.	0
10985	A3UN3WS3Y14T86	I love the idea, but the time jumps were too confusing, and the general narrative failed to draw me in. I wanted to read it, but it couldn't hold me.	1
10986	A5M1M9IJEQ8J2	This is funney6 but not to an uproar.  Gets a little repetitious and hard for men to relate on a large scale	1
10987	AYZQB1IDVQYKA	These were only samples of books.  There was no real plot with no conclusions leading to the end.  A bad example.	1
10988	A2LSKD2H9U8N0J	this one was not good I finaly just gave up reding. if you chose to read it, you are welcome to	0
10989	AYQ8I31JMBDHV	The story is not bad, but the writing is stilted, the characters one-dimensional, and the book generally lacks charm. Too bad.	1
10990	A1GXMV51WGSDND	So did reading this book, I guess I just don't like common &#34;romance&#34;. Too long spent on describing love scenes and the scenery.	1
10991	AHIK05GWXQXD9	Ok I guess. Same old tired jokes but some laughs. Glad it was a free book,would have been a shame to have paid for it.	1
10992	A34UVSQS9YK02J	Worst book I've ever read.  Hopeless characters, inane plot.  David, don't give up your day job.  Writing is definitely not your forte.	0
10993	A3RE2Y8NAG9XGV	I'm sorry I'm so sorry I bought this book it won't happen again I can promise you that . It was definitely fiction of some type.	0
10994	AZQSQSF2QI02F	This was a strange one for me. I kept wanting to psychoanalysis the main character. I liked that she finally came out of her shell at the end.	1
10995	A3M8HRUFXJK8SA	I know its a  cute story but e as hoping for more heat less blah . It's ok that's all	1
10996	A2E33TUPFILNWQ	Too convenient. Just was lacking to me. The story just did not flow, the main guy lead was weak to me.	1
10997	ABLQYZ8GVPKUE	Ok I know it was only $ .99 but I want my money back. This book sucked and I knew I shouldn't have bought it smh	0
10998	ACZ5LNG7B7F7X	Too short! No substance to the book.  Why do I need more owrds for this disappointing book.  The first six words said enough.	0
10999	AIL9H672PCS7J	This was a short story. The first in this series of short stories all about the same people. That was very disappointing.	1
11000	AMC0R9AQSEMKR	If not for the sex scene, I would call this a cute little story. I felt the ending was rushed.	1
11001	AY5E0O8II03DY	Boring---just couldn't get into the plot.  Glad it was one of the freebies.  Guess it was not to my tastes inmysteries	0
11002	A2QQA7UASBHVE	I did not like the whole question answer format of the book. This did not suit my own personal like.	0
11003	A2QPGRPP1FWOF7	This was a very predictable plot and outcome. After the first few pages it was boring and nonsensical.  I didn't finish reading this one.	1
11004	A11ATFXZO1DVXA	I just wasn't convinced.  It didn't sound Amish to me.  I only finished the first book in the set.  The writing was amateurish and the characters were implausible	1
11005	A1H8P52DEOK740	Reads as if a non-English speaker wrote this. Not worth reading. So many errors, it's hard to follow the action of the story. Skip it.	0
11006	A1IGZJIN29DBJQ	Didn't like story. Stopped reading after the first chapter. Wasn't my cup of tea.	1
11007	A4XJZOFLZ1QY2	so bad. so incredibly bad. waste of my money. waste of my time. waste. waste. waste. don't do it, save your money and your time!!!!	0
11008	A35D6YRZT99BOV	Really average, been there done that. This is yet another example f copy cat writing. Do none of the current crop of authors have any original ideas	0
11009	A297T9OMX3TR41	Not funny (unless you consider mean pranks and fart jokes funny), totally predictable and LOTS of grammatical and formatting errors.  Ugh!	0
11010	A2B0RNCAQ7S8H5	All I have to say is read the other one star reviews, and that pretty much wraps it up...could have been good but way to unbelievable	0
11011	A1INXSTMY1TQ4G	So contrived and cliche ridden that even my dog wouldn't read it.Even if you are using someone else's credit card it still isn't worth it.	1
11012	A3V5YJJZI2G2NN	I read just about everything.  This wasn't a very interesting book as far as I was concern just kind of ended weird	1
11013	A32AUTWA8MM81K	Just a little bit off for me.  This is a fun novella.  But, my mind kept wandering.  The characters are interesting.  But, not enough. Clean	1
11014	AS3YP85NHDC2K	Not worth space on my kindle fire. I don't understand why write just to try to get a reader to buy entire book. Makes no sense.	0
11015	A11JRXYOQ30C5R	Loved her other books which were a real bargain for $.99 but was disappointed in this one and also it's similarity to Reilly's story.	1
11016	A2SEYI40BCVL8A	The story is too short..... the author could have added more chapters to make the story more realistic and not just ending it so abruptly!	1
11017	A3TKP1P1H5LXGU	I tried really hard to like this series. The first book was marginally better than this one. Just too predictable.	1
11018	A25F72L3GQ1Y4N	This was a bizarre read.  I really have to keep this author's name at the top of my &#34;Don't Bother&#34; list.	0
11019	A241KGBWGBLNEA	First two books were really good. But the third book was nothing short of strange!! It seemed to have little in common with the first two books.	1
11020	A2C1AZGM3GCZUV	If you just wanna read about sex and spsnking this is what you want. If you want a good story read, this ain't it.	0
11021	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	I did not cared for this ebook. I did not finish this ebook. I would not recommend it to others.	1
11022	A1TA5QYECZP1L1	If this book jus had more detail. Just a tweak or two away from good. Has promise, So close, next time.	1
11023	A3CLGJ1ZO4Z5T5	This is stupid, bland, unsurprising, and not even the sex is very good. If you have anything else to read - ANYTHING else - do it :-)	0
11024	AMI70E6VFBQ5C	Not a bad story or characters. However the poor editing greatly diminishes the pleasure of the NOVEL. Even characters names are misplaced. Unfortunate.	1
11025	A2EXWPIC72MZQT	wasn't too crazy about this one... someone else may love it, but for me, wasn't the best.  It's a short book, so give it a go.	0
11026	AW7QU0ZKR9NHT	I guess one would have to have read the rest of the collection for context. This story was boring and predictable. Perhaps I just missed the point.	1
11027	A7DS27A85WRK4	I tried to read all three but all of them were the same way  I wanted to ee sparks and lal I got was kindling trying to catch fire.	0
11028	APEYJTTJZ2ABV	Well written story,but characters were not too believable.  The end was satisfying.  The grammar was acceptable,  I did finish it.	1
11029	A10CCHB7R192NG	The author is just a bad writer. The action was contrived and the characters were flat. The dialogue lacked imagination so that the work was just one dimensional  and unbelievable.	0
11030	A2FWDFDTKM383A	Both characters feel wooden to me. The one whos blind mostly acts like a child and the other one just gives in. Not a very interesting read.	1
11031	A3361XGKYF17S3	I feel robbed. There. Was anything n this book. No action Justinian meet wolf that's it. No sex or anything.	1
11032	A29K38ABS8E9FD	This could have been charming but for the trope. Too much cliche not enough solid writing. The horse was even white!	1
11033	A31SQHOVLXGHXV	Too bizarre for my liking.  Pretty predictable ending.  It was a frightening story though so, if you enjoy that type of book you may like this one.	1
11034	A3LJST1RMWS5X0	All you have to do is go to McDonald's or Starbucks and get a job until you land the job of your dreams.  Simple as that.	0
11035	A1OAHQY4MBKZZV	I found myself skipping paragraphs because the chapters were boring. The story line was ok but the writing style was immature especially with Lex.	1
11036	A2K7ZHCDQQA2B2	This is a very real, excruciatingly accurate, tale of typical teachers! The true love is between the female and her job, not the two main characters. No steam, little romance.	1
11037	A3EUWDJRITS8SB	I enjoy a good erotic book from time to time. This was not one of them. Just didn't seem to get the engine running.	1
11038	A17PS64UZCXC6Y	I couldn't read this.  It was too out there for me and I just couldn't make myself care.  Didn't want to waste my time.	1
11039	AUVZRT6ZB1BUM	This story was completely boring. Nothing interesting happened. As bland as it gets. At least it was free. A waste.	0
11040	A3JAUBU55BLJSY	Nobody reads erotica for mental growth; but this story was dumber than most stories.  No man who is falling in love with someone  treats the female as this man did.	1
11041	A3G7OLIC03JCOC	This book was too short and there wasn't enough story line for them to really get anywhere. I felt it was a let down.	1
11042	AZMMFZKJB8PV6	the heroine and the hero have sex in the locker room, not development nothing its that dry, that simple. i didn't like it,i couldn't do it.	0
11043	A21NQBS0SA85YR	Like a dog chasing his tail. A lot of his actions seemed useless and a waste of energy and page reading.	1
11044	A3E8SGCO98QXFB	Not a customer of porn. This book is lame. There is a novel exerpt at the end of this, which is strange, but overall, boring and poorly written.	0
11045	A2268HZAAQN213	I tried and tried to keep reading this book but the main character &#34;JUJU&#34; REALLY GOT ON MY RESERVE NERVE!!!STOPPED READING IT AND DELETED FROM MY KINDLE!	0
11046	A236H5MV9FMMHP	The story line was ok, but not great. What bothered me the most were the many, many grammatical errors. I was irritated beyond belief.	1
11047	A2N484P77PUSPM	I know it is  fiction but this is not close to likeable.  Maybe someone else will like it,but not me	1
11048	A2LQ5EHM15S3EG	I would not classify about half of these stories as science fiction.  The two long stories in the middle were rubbish.  I will not touch any of these collections again.	0
11049	A2334IDF3KG3C1	It was not my form of humor, but it may appeal to some readers with different sense of humor .	0
11050	A2IUE8ERXIZ6YB	I couldn't bring myself to even get halfway through this book. I really, really tried and just couldn't get into the thing.	0
11051	AC6228LNZC1UQ	The book ratchet woman was ok I didn't get why it was called ratchet woman but overall the book was good	1
11052	A395S93OVWJQYF	Is this really some hood fantasy ? Teenage coke dealer does good in Chicago. Ni**a please. Luckily it's short and entertaining.	1
11053	A19JO4QWMGSTAT	if i wanted crappy stories and even crappier plots, I would have turned to my local library for the &#34;trash&#34; books they throw away every season!	0
11054	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	your into impregnations by monster type wolf highbreds. I was curious, not so any more. Will make a point to skip these types of stories in the future.	0
11055	A10H9EAJA1TAJT	This was a decent story line i don't believe it was worth the price!! Hood love 2 was wayy more juicy! Not a great follow up	1
11056	A30MIGN3SP46RU	I'm very confused as to what went on in this book. Hopefully when I read part two it will give me  a better idea	1
11057	A1I3CP8FQTLR8	This book tried very hard to maintain a high level of suspense throughout the story, but was often lacking in substance.	1
11058	A2RVS5ASOIUB67	This is a story that sounds like it was written by a sixth grader. It had no beginning and not character development. A complete waste of time.	0
11059	A1RNCYCYWZPPOY	Don't waste your time- unless you are a teenager and inexperienced this will bore you to DEATH. I will never get the five minutes that I wasted reading this back.	0
11060	A2BHEPYIDR182L	I love all things mobsters and I wanted this to be better then it was. It just did not hold my interest.	1
11061	A1NPPSRU29U2RN	What a waste of my time. You have a great story going, why not all of it? Maybe some day.	1
11062	A1NSQ9EHF7SM5E	I hate when a book starts getting good and it ends . . . There really wasnt much to read . . . Which sucks	0
11063	A1J5PU0XG94AWV	I thought it had to do with the other high heel mystery books, but characters were all diferent. sorry.  okay storyline.	1
11064	A2CCO4HWIFOP5J	As a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I found this pretty silly. The premise, the execution, the characters, all of it. Just too silly.	1
11065	AOUPEIOL1VGWP	Lame story.  I mean seriously?  Pay a woman so a guy can drink milk from her breasts?	0
11066	A3TQHWKAHXRMLU	Nothing about this book was good.  The story was nothing but cheesy fluff. The characters were completely one dimensional. Not even worth $.99.	0
11067	A3AQKF73Y2VWTL	Um there was way more sex then context. It was slow and really dragged in other parts. I just thought there would be more.	1
11068	A277E492GU5QS	Not very in-depth, but good contact information for those folks who are going to be visiting the areas these &#34;haunts&#34; are located in.	1
11069	A1DPQ62TTCIG8L	I expected a completely different ending to this story.  I truly hope that the next book brings a more joyous ending along with the return of Finn.	1
11070	A2ZKE9CGRFCO6U	I had this read in less than an hour and was so disappointed.  The sample was a lot better than the book itself.	0
11071	A2A2O4LPO8UN1D	This book was mildly entertaining. I found it tedious which made it long. I didn't find the characters believable. I just couldn't get into it.	1
11072	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	let down. Did not think it was worth the money spent at all. Nothing in it seemed of real value.	0
11073	A1H6SBO7R007I8	It was free, so I cant really complain, it was just a little slow for me, and my girlfriend and my sister...	0
11074	AY4QGULWLUZZZ	This one was one of the extremely few that I gave up on . I couldn't finish it . Sorry	1
11075	A3A70BBKSE8V9N	This is not a cookbook i would recommend to many people. I wasn't impressed with the recipes. I could have found them in any regular cookbook.	1
11076	A3OUOIHX3A34QV	This was a struggle to continue to reading and then became unmemorable.  I wish I could remember what it was about but unfortunately, it was forgettable.	1
11077	A2CBHZ0KXUSPLN	This story had promise but fell short. Everything came to easy. I needed to be heartbroken. This seemed like a high senior' s essay. I would not recommend this book.	1
11078	AXI2Q2XTNSJ65	The only reason this piece of trash got 1 star is there is no zero star rating. This is a worthless piece of Anti-US Propaganda.	0
11079	A1UUB0XO85A92L	Typical best friend attraction turned into love. Nothing unusual called the stranger's identity from the first or second page. It was free!	1
11080	A1NSQ9EHF7SM5E	This book was on the boring side . . . It definitely wasn't exciting enough to read the sequel . . . Best of luck to the author	1
11081	AAO0FHX90Y80A	Basic advise like any website or blog would have.  I didn't learn any new organizing tricks or ways to save money.	1
11082	A11DULA4L6RZFX	The art was no as amazing as everyone rated.the idea of the story is decievinhAnd plot is really bad	0
11083	A1QMRP6KLZDMAT	Not at all what I had in mind. I was looking for soemthing more along the lines of Alistair McLean's novels and these were poorly written and not very interesting.	1
11084	A39K3158E8T26V	Did not cut it. Maybe I don't like the way Mr. Hewson writesNot enough to peak my interest. Sorry.	0
11085	A1Z3307RXXDE6J	very disappointed in this one chapter short story. Not a book with a color. Only sex.will not recommend this author to anyone.	0
11086	A200GQJX3V1XNF	Don't get me wrong.  I like hot sex but I also want a good story behind it. Only the last story was believableBut barely.  Oh we'll, it was only 99cents.	1
11087	A1IUG7O26R94DZ	I prefer more storyline. Too much description in sex acts.  The tease is getting the next book when it should be just a new chapter.	1
11088	A19U4MPCMOI003	I didn't particularly like this book. The love story was lame. Very predictable.  It seemed as if the sex scenes and the love story was two different thought processes	1
11089	A1G2GYX8B4OH8W	This was free for me, and I thought the story line had potential. The idea of spying or watching when you shouldn't. But somehow it didn't translate for me.	1
11090	A3LEA5ABR3PC3X	I do not like leaving negative reviews with that being said this book was all over the place..resisting Ryder was not for me	1
11091	A1RNCYCYWZPPOY	Mind-numbingly boring. I would not recommend it to anyone. I'm a science fiction fan but this isn't worth the effort of turning the pages.	0
11092	A37YWD5NUX3C9G	This is one I have not read yet. I think I started it and it did not hold my attention, therefor I did not finish it.	0
11093	ADNOJCMF0OBOH	I just couldn't seem to get into this book. Nothing in the first quarter of the book made me want to continue reading it.	1
11094	A1D9BS4IIOBKQE	I was looking forward to reading this comedy but after a while i realized I was not enjoying it at all do it got deleted	1
11095	APN49ZJWE11UA	The book is slow moving, I can skip pages and still know what happened, No thrills or guessing what will happen next	1
11096	A35I3N1Q1AD7JA	I liked the first two but I hated the ending on this one. I may not ready any more of hers.	0
11097	ALKWXV9QFSN01	I do not get all the great reviews. This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.	0
11098	A2USZHMFI4G5A9	Claude is an interesting writer of love and history. She  puts you in the middle of each scene  you feel the music see the gowns live the moment.	1
11099	A1NDMPC1Y56X53	Didn't know it was short stories.  None of them were long enough to satisfy.  Whatever. I didn't get the sense of any of them.	1
11100	A9IHYNBIGH2TB	This book simply wasn't for my tastes and there really wasn't a story line. I'm not sure what i was expecting but this wasn't it.	0
11101	A28REJAM6899K8	There was really no story line here. You want to try to believe the woman is just crazy. Oh well maybe the next one.	0
11102	AJM1AAAAWS62	These recipies are very hard to rate. This book is terribly formatted. It is almost unreadable. The cutesy font ruined what otherwise might have been a decent cookbook.	0
11103	AG59A0NL1VKGW	Not what I wanted	0
11104	A2AK2U6WTC0MK7	Didn't really keep me interested in the book, thought there could of been more action in it to keep you on edge.	1
11105	A15QR95MOUYNOX	I was hoping this would be a in depth look at Tesla' s life but it's just an advertisement for a stupid self help book.	0
11106	A1S8J1UTWPZ6XB	After reading recipes decided this was something I would not use. I like simple recipes that are easy and don.t use many ingrediants.	1
11107	A1ECN924JG66L9	160 pages for $4. Somebody certainly is a bit too proud of their work. Especially when written like a high schooler. It's an interesting story, but not that interesting.	1
11108	A30K9MEPFESK61	If I can't remember what the story is about just 2 days after reading it then I would say it had to be pretty bad.	0
11109	A23EZTR5P2R0MA	Wasn't such a big fan. I prefer more modern novels, without the big words. Would be okay if you liked this style of writing.	0
11110	A3N80BBIVW31QP	This was an ok book, how ever I do wish the author would have done more to make it more interesting.	1
11111	A2F8Z0D1X2FBFP	cant give this more than a 2 star rating because of the lack of character development. if you like sci fi futuristic then this may appeal to you.	1
11112	A2XZHXLDPD7KCK	This so called erotica has way too much space and not enough sex. Good thing it was free or I would want a refund.	0
11113	A3M40XDULQO1EN	Dumb does not even explain how stupid this story was.  It could have been great but was not.  It lacked depth and character developement.  Not good.  DON'T buy it.	0
11114	A39TY6P1V76LKL	I thought this was a collection of books.  Turns out this was a book of samples from her books.  I don't care for sample books.	0
11115	AA36E93I33R7V	This book was not a good read at all, I actually deleted it from my Kindle. Was not what I expected	0
11116	A28B9NWKYGYDU	Plot was too easy.  Got bored half way through.  I just could not continue reading this one.  Not for me.	0
11117	A1J0HW1CYZXUQN	This is not going the way I want it to. Another book must be read, and I hope I'm happy with the conclusion.	1
11118	AF1D3SZPJNWR6	Gave up about half way through.  Too much repetition, too much that didn't make sense and was hard to follow.	1
11119	A3SW2SH4B9VQD2	A vehicle for subscription only.  Waste of download time. I felt mislead. Good thing it was a free disappointment. Don't bother unless you already subscribe to NG.	0
11120	A8GLSUFX1P9XC	i did not read this. I read a few pages and decided it was not for me. Maybe someone else will like it	0
11121	ADO9QCTOPPQLK	I don't like books that are ( as I see it) you know  I went to the well and found a horse	0
11122	A2D9TXIG661W2X	This book was nothing exciting.  I forced myself to finish it because I paid for it.  The storyline has potential, but the writing feels armature.	1
11123	A4433A9IQFRFJ	Honestly, I couldn't even get through it and now I can't even remember what it was about.  Obviously had no positive impression on me.	0
11124	AQGXX38IHGMM6	I don't like it. It said a bad word. And it's is a children's books  this is a bad  book. :(	0
11125	A1NAFNL0K8K9IH	Killer Fudge was disappointing based on my read of the other stories in this series. Enjoyed the full length stories in this series.	1
11126	A8GILEKQ6Z67P	This book was only fair.  It has been over a month since I read it.  Believe it was short and not on my favorite list.	1
11127	A1SITVBOE1KA2E	"Too many near pictures. Enjoyable anyway. Would not purchase and after viewing will delete the book. The photos o only  appear 2x3"" size not great for photo  book."	1
11128	AYQ8I31JMBDHV	Not a bad story, but the writing is so stilted, it makes it quite painful to read. This author needs a lot more practice.	1
11129	A3PNGXKLLN533H	If I had realized what this book was about I would have never bothered reading it. The only good thing I can say about it, it was short.	0
11130	A20FC0ZLSYG5LZ	Fantasy is not my preferred genre, and this was pretty unreal. The plot was like a tv show on some channel directed to women. Yuck.	1
11131	A1C2X2BVKATNEG	Watch out. Pretty far-fetched soft core stuff.  Very repititious. It's not about her life whitch might have been interesting. Its John after johngetting off. peyew!	0
11132	A1IVRN9H0EFUSF	There were several errors in this book, and the story was simplistic. The plot didn't have much to it. I wouldn't recommend it.	1
11133	A1C72IZAM879HN	Short sweet and straight to d point. Need to read much more from J.M Cochrane let the story continue on.	1
11134	A1PM517CRNZOK3	This a book mainly on how to use the Internet to improve your marketing and has little use for me	0
11135	A2Y44ZHSAMKR0K	This book was not what I thought it was going to be. I didn't like it all. Didn't finish reading it.	0
11136	A293W2MU6STRGP	A short novel showing the basis of bondage and submission. Definitely not recommended for younger readers or those of a squeamish nature.	0
11137	ADU1OGV7GG3S6	An interesting account of several escapes.  This book is not very long and documents attempts at both German and Russian POW camps.	1
11138	AGEY1DG8JFBGI	A good book but too short. It is like the author is selling the books in chapters. A good story but may not be worth buying it in pieces.	1
11139	AC7C2EWX2I9EX	Boring. Boring. Boring and more boring.  You pay for a chapter, not a book.  I didn't find anything redeeming about the main character.	0
11140	A3RVRQ2CENY9BC	I used to do a lot of canning and was looking for some new recipes.  Unfortunately I was disappointed that no recipes were included	1
11141	A1S663SQZGPF1F	I would like to have my money back.  Terrible, no plot,no sex other than vanilla between an old married couple.	0
11142	A2DT6NVG11IEN4	I really didn't care for this short story. I felt that a few things were missing and I just didn't like it.	1
11143	A23PZOQOBPPOO0	This charger doesn't charge in 4 hours. I have had my kindle plugged in over night and still not a full charge	0
11144	A12RYTEJCJ3H0M	Very bloody and depressing.  The story gives very little hope of survival, or even a reason to want to survive.  Why try?	1
11145	A1U4JIEKSJG8QQ	I am not sure how to rate this one with so many people going against others.  The alpha were or appeared to be to weak.  I	1
11146	A15LNY1WWTEGAL	This is awful!  The stories are trusted authority figures and the girl that trusts them.  I deleted it.  There is nothing emotional or fun about this series of books.	0
11147	A2XAKEH3ZBZXCF	I skipped so many pages and still did not miss anything. The story line was stupid and childish. I as will not read anymore of her books	0
11148	A2C26L2NGS814J	Sorry not my cup  of tea. I need a little more. No pictures so I can not picture it  at all.	0
11149	A27F3S1WQD583O	The characters were introduced will and their characters were defined but the story took too long. Could've added more plot instead of dragging.	1
11150	A3P29QHVZ6JWV8	I honestly read 2 chapters than deleted the book.  Could not get into it. Not worth money, not worth your time.	0
11151	ANRYZ177MKH59	Unfortunately, I found this rather short tale quite predictable and not really all that interesting...At least it was free...	1
11152	A1NOJQOLXQP06D	Pretty easy to guess the finale. Pity the protagonist couldn't see it coming. Not enough twists and turns for me.	1
11153	A1TP0YYWWYTBP7	this didn't do me any good but it might help someone hope it does it just didn't help me any	0
11154	A1G5ETL4DH52XC	This book was a real let down. Gets into people turning into animals and bizarre stuff and mystic stuff. Wouldn't recommend if you are looking for a realistic story.	0
11155	A2M6G35BNRRWXS	Old riddles in ancient english.Some bearly make sense and other are just a waste.None are clever or worth reading a second time.	1
11156	A3NH1FV748GAA3	I didn't feel there was much story involved in this one.  It wasn't as good as others in the Lusty, Texas series.	1
11157	A2AAW4AX9CIKM1	Five stars.  Two different worlds becoming one.  Just could not put it down. I read it all...... I also read Oceans Apart. Just keep on writing about love for everyone.	0
11158	A2O41EKFNXG49L	Really dislike this author and books. I tried a second one to be sure as the concept should be interesting. Boring characters with no real plot.	0
11159	A1NHQL8QIYIE52	I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this one was the same sentence, over and over and over.	0
11160	A20NUAFQ658EGG	The plot was contrived and forced.  Little cohesion in the plot line with extraneous carp thrown in as filler.  Fortunately it was free.	1
11161	ABLQYZ8GVPKUE	This book was too darn confusing.....the story was all over. In the next book the author need to explain something's.	1
11162	A3T2ZYSOQNMV0A	Buy a pack of gum instead. I want the 45 minutes it took to read this back. Happy New Years.	0
11163	ABCJCF1B3AP0W	One trick pony that is all to obvious. I'm tired of these short ebooks. Not worth the money. Better books out there .	0
11164	A31K2RCOQAWM3B	The story was simply boring. I knew what was going to happen before it happened. I can't see myself investing in another Tia Kelly book. Sorry...	0

11166	A33ISCN236OF5Q	Just couldn't get into it and missed the whole point.Would not waste money to buy it.  Hope his other works are more interesting.	1
11167	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Not at all what I excepted.  Nothing noteworthy about it.  Thank goodness it was short.  Really wish it could be given zero stars.	0
11168	A2Z6KRS3OMTLLJ	Wasted writing on intimacy. Not very creative storyline. Lacking in creating interest for those who have a good imagination without outward intimate description.	1
11169	A1WGJ79HRDVN3N	Too complex for little ones. Maybe a book for 6th graders but not toddlers. I didn't like it at all	0
11170	A3FF9B6A977XVU	I guess THOACW 2 is really Deadman's Vengeance. BLUNT wrote this story years ago. I purchased it thinking I was finally getting the end of the story. New cover...New Title...2	1
11171	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	This book was poorly edited.I learned more in Home Eco.101 many years ago. I would hate to taste the food made with the substitutions.	1
11172	A2GTE6M079W0ED	"I read a very similar book ""The Island of Dr, Moreau"" and saw a movie like this too.I wasn't wild about them either."	1
11173	A2H3WKM06RU328	I did not find book helpful, as the title,A step-by-step Guide To Writing Your First Novel, suggested.  Save your money.	1
11174	AEGRTQERQHLJ1	Stolen words from multiple fanfiction authors does not make Shey an &#34;author&#34;.  It makes her a thief.  Shame on Amazon for not removing these books permanently.	0
11175	A1G7GW8DBJ5MB	got the book on my kindle read the first few pages and didnt like it erased it off my kindle	1
11176	A3LC52PBBXTHLG	This book started it pretty good, with a mysterious mirror that should have had  mystic powers. The storyline had potential, but became rather boring after that.	1
11177	A3LF3DW7C85EM3	But even if it was not my genre,and taking into account it was a short story, this was not worth the read.	1
11178	AD2GAC3HLN9K3	Did not feel that the storyline really ever developed enough to keep my interest. This novel is unfilled potential. I looked for more plot development.	1
11179	A2XN1DM7L6OXG2	Don't know what to say about this book.Never read anything like it and hope I won't again. Good luck.	0
11180	A2MCLUTB2THK6U	this book had some interesting moments but mostly it was predictable thus making it a bit slow. Has potential but just missed the spot	1
11181	A19BT2EPCDVACA	I was enjoying the story but then it was over to quick, Story was much to short, it didnt not entice me enough to want to buy the longer version.	1
11182	A39WYE2YM9GPX4	A lot of unnecessary drama and immaturity.  It really became too much about half was through the book.  I am not sure if I can recommend.	1
11183	A3G7OLIC03JCOC	This wasn't funny. It was pitiful. It was also too short for a short story. Didn't care for it.	1
11184	A33OH7H3R2EIH3	The story was ok but the grammar was horrible. If you can overlook the grammar, it is not bad. You get what you pay for in this case.	1
11185	ABTFJSY7FJJ92	I have read all of Jessica Park's books and this one was not her best,  But it doesn't have a decent story line	1
11186	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	Even thou this was free, I deleted it from my Kindle. This was a terrible book. Completely predictable. Not happy.	0
11187	A5TB7QKCHCVPP	I wouldn't read again.  Not my favorite vampire books... Not saying all bad just not what I liked.  Don't recommend this series...	1
11188	A2DKCX4RURV8QQ	This series continues its downward spin in this poorly written book. The grammar continues to be subpar as is the plot and the story development.	0
11189	A3ADUVEN6OGN7Z	Found it OK but too old-fashioned. An update would be much better now! It is well done, but too archaic in the translation	1
11190	A2Y6LT98OLDEOL	I was interested in seeing how the author would change the classic story.  Although the premise was good, I did not feel the connection between the love interest.	1
11191	ACZY01O7AJBG5	Is this author for real ??This author clearly base this book off of Rihanna and Chris Brown. Because the heroine is just plain dumb.	0
11192	A23FKXZ5VNQUN7	How come I can fix this keyboard but  can't receive my books from you guys? What am I to do?	0
11193	A1A7MN1H7V132L	Had no idea what this book was about when I selected it. Had I known what the content was I would not have purchased it at all. Shallow and unwilling.	0
11194	A2TTKJDQM5W4ZA	I was very surprised with this writing fro Ms. McBride, I found the book did not have a very interesting storyline; the timing was tedious and predictable.	1
11195	AXWEDVA18XJVR	"I am not amused.  A short story that went nowhere.  What exactly was the point?  I wish I could get back the time spent reading this ""book"""	0
11196	A1WIGLDJ491TXW	A very silly premise and overly long, boring, ho hum, not enough sex and pretty boring sex scenes and a lot of blather.	0
11197	ATQ79P6WIN2Y2	This book went back and forth fron interesting to dragging. I finally gave up on it. I admit I did not finish. Too much drawn out &#34;mystery&#34; for me.	1
11198	A1HBWSGJUKIG8R	I really love the two guys one girl thing but this one did not cut it for me. It was just ok could have been better	1

11200	A04666331NYU0YWTDI5DA	Ok the sex and the parties were great but it did not have enough juicy story telling and it just finished without an ending.the next book better be amazing	1
11201	AQF3XAFCMORVK	I tried to read this book.  Could not get past the first 6 chapters.  It just is not my cup of tea. Perhaps it is yours, however.	0
11202	A1H58I96123UAS	This could have been an opportunity to expand on the original hotness, but it left me underwhelmed compared to Emma's other work.	1
11203	A35LVXGVZOVM1A	value for money - this book gets a big fat zero. i mean - such a SHORT book is definitely not worth 2.99.i cant believe this author. at all.	0
11204	A1C68YRR7TMHI0	I thought that this story, Christmas Crumble, didn't have a lot of interesting story line, had I known a bit more about the book, I wouldn't have purchased it.	0
11205	A3THTW05PBK378	It began as an action adventure in the end it bogged down on only feelings, just not my cup of tea, personal opinion.	0
11206	A12UGM39O9MLC9	Way too hard to read.  What was I thinking?  I'm sure the actual content of ths Superman comic is fine in print edition.	0
11207	A3TCBK4JXM2GJ0	This book is so poorly written that I couldn't force myself to finish chapter 1 - I can't recommend it to anyone	0
11208	A2EW7YA857XOTK	The character development isn't there. There's not enough info for me to feel like I know them & didn't fall in love with them or their story.	0
11209	A1KUHDY2U2MW5J	I didn't like the half beast transformation during sex.  I'm sorry, but the partial change was not appealing to me.	0
11210	A1GQEH3S58URDX	This little short story was delightful to read. Not one of those that leaves u hanging. The humor is excellent.	1
11211	A3AW5WHOHQ5J3W	I liked the start but then there were too many leaps of faith on what was the fantasy world. I had to work to finish the book.	1
11212	A2C31MB5DIP2DM	This was not the real Grey Man full of adventure and assassinations.  I was disappointed because I really like the Grey Man series.	1
11213	AZF1DJ228E4PS	Could not get interested in this short story. I do like Baldacci's characters and plots and this short didn't really have either.	0
11214	A2K8C9X2HE2INE	I am trying to slog through this book, but it is boring to me. If you are looking for light and airy, this is not it!	1
11215	A3UUU33SUO1EEV	I enjoyed reading the first book but this one is yawn-worthy.  I couldn't even finish it.  And that's rare for me. I won't be reading the others in this series.	1
11216	A3MBD5QNZ79A1G	Found this story disgusting. I'm fairly open minded but this story just pushed my limits for how revolting it was.	0
11217	A29UWJD5SX8BW3	If all you want to read is porn, then this book is for you. It's poorly written, gaudy and even stupid at times. The writing was elementary at best.	0
11218	A1VWIJH012YSFH	"The story was decent but it focused too much on her size and her ""unworthiness"". That took away from the sexiness that excited me in the beginning."	1

11220	A5NZUR5JV9MQB	This was a disappointing read, taking the same old story lines and changing names and locations a little. I lost interest pretty quickly.	1
11221	A2C1XZCSD00D11	"The book cover is a dead giveaway. Would it have killed the author to have this book proofread or to have used a spell checker?""Loose"" weight???  Really?"	0

11223	A12ZUPW48GWAAH	Have not read yet.	0
11224	A3DE5WP5XV9Q4F	I really like the elemental series from this author but I did not like this book and do not intend to read this series	1

11226	A3FSTB28ISLRC9	I couldn't get into this book. I found it very corny and found I was hardly able to finish it.	1
11227	A1AVQYJT1SGLJ9	Very short story with not a lot of anything going for itself.  Plot was weak and left me saying &#34;so what&#34;!  Not for me.	1
11228	A2BX79H27KONN8	I love Christmas related love stories. This one not so much. Lacked substance and too predictable. I would not recommend it even for the cheap price.	1
11229	A1LFOII74LAFOI	I'm not big on sexual abuse or woman that take it. I only got a few chapters in an deleted it from my kindle. Unbelieveable	0
11230	A14BSN8GZ3TZ9W	Crappy writing, crappy storyline, crappy grammar, crappy dialogue, crappy sex scenes, crappy characters, crappy ending, crappy everything. I don't remember the last time I read such crap.	0
11231	A1YLTM0OXZ4QNG	Trying too hard to be funny usually fails miserably. This little collection can definitely be considered as a perfect case in point.	0
11232	A2EQK0F5YAZG5K	A small bit of fun, too reminiscent of  Clayton's skeen stories..but ok...I do like Clayton's heroine better....Oh well....might buy the larger book at some point, to see how it goes...	1
11233	A3TC0SJETXCRSW	not v e Ryan exciting. stories were childish, boring , and completely lacked depth. there really wasn't a storyline...just words trying together sees scenes. don't waste your time.	1
11234	A289W6X8Z6BDES	My 4year old says it's great, because the monkey was the crock's dinner. I didn't like that he ate the monkey and no good lesson.	1
11235	AB8HX628HHQSV	This book was so stupid Karma was such a whore & so dumb! This story was pointless I want a refund!	1
11236	A2SEYI40BCVL8A	This book is too short for me. I  wish the author had added more depth to the story... The story is likeable but short.	1
11237	A17O8GDLNWCQGV	Not worth your time, book ends way to short, feeling unfinished. The whole idea is to get you hooked on the author but that was an epic fail for me.	0
11238	A3VTEJNJDC7744	I enjoyed the interracial relationshipwasn't happy with the story line to muchI felt the love storyline wasn't  believable	1
11239	A2HXPQ4ZKFKKAI	I read Rees and liked it so I decided to try this one.. It just seemed that it was the same as Rees just changed character names.. It became repetitive...	1
11240	A2JU496OQUPD1E	I took a chance and got the book after liking the sample. I was hoping for more but I guess its just erotica. The storyline wasn't terribly deep.	1
11241	AJ693G50F786P	A whole lot of fluff and very little help. I flew over much. I think this book was directed to young chicks, not adult readers.	1
11242	A3B2W0W6XO48O9	Monster, Cold Blooded and The Protectors were brilliant.  But I found this paranormal story awful. Not his usual high standard.	1
11243	AL4U1EJS2VTM1	Word to the WISE: This book is NOT worth your time or the space on your kindle believe Me!! Very UNSATISFACTORY!!!! The storyline is lousy!	0
11244	A3J8EIHWOYWWUC	This book didn't live up to it's title. It was about the great earthquake, but I found it slow and cumbersome.	1
11245	AB92H9TMYS1O1	Just like many of these romance novels, a light beach type read, but fun. Took it on vacation with me.	1
11246	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	I received this story for FREE so wasn't expecting to much but what the hey.....It wasn't the worst thing I've read but it wasn't the best either.	1
11247	A353WH7847912O	I thought that this story was not very believable. It required more character development in the body of the story. I was not put into the story like others.	1
11248	A39YYERVZFJ45Z	I purchased this book but it was so boring to me. I couldn't even get through the next chapter.  I ended up eating my purchase.	0
11249	A11ATXABJX9G79	The heroine was too naive to be relatable. And since the hero's sex drive apparently influenced everything he does, he was also unrelateable. Characters were too shallow and storyline unplausible	1
11250	A1GM70SB2UN58N	This book was okay, but something was lacking in the read. Not sure if it was the length or the writing did not move me.	1
11251	A1D7UOS1Z1MDFA	Aside from typos, you can only call Sam the store owner so many times before it gets tiresome. And did the kid go to college in Texas or Arizona?	1
11252	A20UPWA5X8UY6Z	This was a borrow. For the most part I didn't enjoy the book. It needs an editor. The abrupt ending and feeling of unfinished business ruined the book.	1
11253	A1BLVCVTR48OK	The story starts well but then it peters off in to an uninteresting chore. Difficult to finish if you are not very courageous	1
11254	A19SA8FJDPC62E	The original was apparently an alphabet primer. The file for this picture book lists the alphabet a few times, but has no pictures.	0
11255	A1KF8SQ291JDIH	I just couldn't get into the book . At times you find books like that you just can't follow it.	1

11258	A39HW1PLXZFSEN	Hard to believe that camp David blows up and all the marines guarding the retreat are no where in site. The book is ok...	1
11259	A3D95VGKRXG2O7	I did not like this book. It took way to long to get interesting and it was like at 80 % I won't read the series.	1
11260	A38DIX88M5T94P	Nothing new, nothing special. Would have to disagree with a lot of it. Everyone's items would be different, but some of these.... I didn't get at all	1
11261	A33X6REP438GKQ	i'm so disappointed with this book, half way through and still just wordy wordy wordy. Sorry but it's just plain boring.	0
11262	A1PFT1QQ6QXQ37	This is a cliffy.  The story was going okay and them it just ends.  Not liking that and I feel like I wasn't warmed up front.	1
11263	AKN7EFCLKX12C	Not being in the States right now, there were many recipes I couldn't use. I also prefer the chocolate cookies.	0
11264	AA726IIV1H01	The series started out interesting and then just became a very weird series. I finished the series, but I will never read them again.	0
11265	A3R7D2ZOP4YDTJ	Fell flat. Too much going on and I skipped pages. How many times did Blaze need to be hospitalized for some sort of injury?  Too redundant	0
11266	A3AORKSBK9JM1W	Excellent story.  No messy violence & great ending. I could bot put it down.  The whole story was about love &  family & community at a very special time.	0
11267	A2ZTV41C3M28GI	This was a story called neville not magical dragon The story was cute but not what it says it is	0
11268	A2VUUIW8FNH0DN	I love western novels. But this one reads like it was written for a twelve year old. I had to force myself to finish it. Typo's galore besides? Forget it.	0
11269	A34CL1YGCE4DPD	The premise of this book was interesting. While i did read it all, though, i found myself confused and not really interested enough to continue the series.	1
11270	AB5DP7AM479QJ	if there was a previous book it might have helped. i just did not enjoy the story. didn't like the characters	1
11271	AYJJ7H6U1TS1R	For me I found this book very sad and depressing. There was some funny parts in the story however I felt like the characters were sort of going in circles.	1
11272	A2FQ9JUYW147TC	There were too many things going on to make a cohesive flowing story. In never really ended up caring about the characters and the ending was a bust.	0
11273	A3VBVQ81YPMDYT	blah blah i read this in 10 minutes, and it really sucked. Wish I could get my time back... oh well at least it was free	0
11274	A3LX7V74JG4HV3	I found this book to be rather boring. It was not what I expected from the author and would not recommend it to others.	1
11275	A140SJ629W852U	To short! People need to actually write a longer book if it is a chapter book for older good kids!!	1
11276	ABEK1Q70KABM3	I did not like this book. If you're looking for a sweet, romantic love story with some erotica, this is not the book for you.	1
11277	A4GO81BSRAXV2	Not what I expected.  Expected a dialogue on nudism, not a porn fest!  Will have to read the reviews a little better.	0
11278	ANU6I4A7ZD6Y6	well....it was saying slow start and middle but finally the end of a little better...not a great book but good ,,,,	1
11279	A3CUIFAXIY2LOI	I don't like serials, and this one just wasn't for me i guess. There wasn't really anything WRONG with it, it's just nothing that was right for me i guess.	0
11280	AQPGZAEKIGOHA	Please stop asking me to rev books that I not read or purchased.	0
11281	A2M2H7BNE3KDXV	I could read page after page of Morris.  Surely someone could have him solve murders in Italy.  Is there any reason why an author could not write about him?	1
11282	A3R6PF7C5J7U6T	I'm so happy that this book was free. Instead of focusing on education, these dumb girls are with these no good men.	0
11283	A1UCGBDNHGKNCP	Definitely not what I expected. Cut to the chase quickly. A little romance, male bonding, tear jerked, happily ever after kind of story.	0
11284	A29M2V3Z5YIL2Q	i read it for free..i thought it was so stupid and dumb...i can't even discribe how dumb i thought this book was...	0
11285	ALFGUMMTD7M4R	Very short story, and just your typical old girlfriend moves back to town and rekindled with old flame.  Nothing new, or interesting in this one.	1
11286	A3DX85FTSO432P	This book was so very slow. I've read books from most of these authors, can't believe they came up with this mess. PLEASE don't waste your money.	0
11287	AMGI8V3DQVIWR	Ok, didn't realize this was 1 book of 4. Kind of dismayed that I didn't realize that on the first place. Was okay for short story, read really fast.	1
11288	A3I94DZFSDSC87	Incest!Forced or not. It was still incest. To think I actually read the whole book. Disgusting and so not okay.Prostitution and &#34;forced&#34; incest was the main topic.	0
11289	A7V6CFV2SSYQS	If you like a lot shooting and killing you  will say this book is okay.  A lot of people involved but easy to track.	1
11290	A25OPTNI505CGJ	Very sweet short story. Not much depth to it. Plot is a bit obvious. Maybe get it when it's free.	1
11291	A25CP6UY1I2W5X	Don't know what to write about the story.  It's a little &#34;far fetched&#34; for my liking. Not into it that much.	1
11292	A2T0TH59LWZS2I	This was just not my cup of tea.  Lily took too long to realize her goal.  Just not my normal read.	1
11293	A8EKW6WFZX792	I had read a similar book years ago by a different author and felt this was more or less a copycat .	0
11294	A1XJ8BRL29EO9S	This is a short story about historical sex scandals. The storys all end abruptly and another time frame begins, leaving you asking what's the point?	0
11295	ASBAWNIGXJ9F1	I didn't care too much for this book. It didn't grab me like the other books I've read by Lisa Jackson	0
11296	A18FLOC8YQY0P8	Overall, the books and content is not bad, but as others have mentioned, there's errors in this. I got tired of my kid asking so I deleted this book..	0
11297	A3361XGKYF17S3	I felt like I waited forever for this book. Then I was really disappointed when reading it. I found myself skipping pages.	1
11298	A1MJ5OIWM844CR	SO HORRIBLE, I DID NOT FINISHED IT I ERASED IT FROM MY KINDLE!  VERY BAD BOOK WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WHO IS NOT RIGHT IN HIS OWN MIND!	0
11299	A30PHXVJI5YZWA	This was not a biography about Nikola Tesla, Though it certainly presents itself as such. It mentions him but that's all.	1
11300	A3HGWIBOFVXA2F	Each story seemed like a good start or outline of story, but ultimately this book didn't satisfy me at all.	0
11301	A1WEUL1YACM6PK	Not enough interaction between the main characters, the book spent too much time on the supporting cast.  Could have been so much more.	1
11302	A1UN7VQ3DJM4T	There was so many errors and missing pieces of the story. I was not impressed with the story. I wish there was more to the background	1
11303	ARGX0QDJTXWBT	nope.....  I had a hard time getting through this ...  I was hoping for a shades of grey ...  got shades of blah.  The plot was boring and felt forced.	0

11306	A3PEYWZ2QWO4GF	Well while the characters were believable and likable the was way to much sex and not enough storyline.  I dont think I will be reading this author again anytime soon.	0
11307	A3O6MGJOMC4M8A	Worst book I ever read . This book is so boring . There is no excitement about this book . The sex scenes are bad everything is just bad.	0
11308	A3A7FF87LEVCQ1	Unless you're already into the author's &#34;Just Cause&#34; universe, this character sketch isn't really worth reading.  Recommended for fans only.	1
11309	A2YQHT0W72J4HT	My impression was the author tried to support his thesis by writing a fictional story.  It did not work for me and I gave up early in the story.	0
11310	A3Q278JFRXRBOB	Quick and trashy. No real plot. If you like erotica then you may enjoy this. Just wasn't impressed.  Guess I like a little more substance	0
11311	A95JAQJPUJBGY	This story is good, but why would her Uncle be touching her like that? I just wish they would say anything, but that close of a relative.	1
11312	A2P983QLKXOIZ2	Poor story line, lack of depth.Cause-Effect out of the blueWhile sounding promising, the author does not deliverHad a hard time finishing it	1

11317	AUVZRT6ZB1BUM	Too sappy. The way they talked...ugh. I was choking on sugar.  I wouldn't recommend this book or pay for it.  Will not be reading this again.	1
11318	A29HBP7OBLUAOA	can't get into it unfortunately, I will have to try again in a few months to write you all a review	0
11319	A3FKSKW10F528G	Should have just added this to the next book.  It isn't worth the money they are charging for it.  Not a must read for the series.	1
11320	A1YSQ63374U8VJ	Basically says just do your baking in muffin pans and it will be apportioned out for serving.Specific timing is useful I suppose.	0
11321	A18J6LPBVZ3CI0	This short story was about an enjoyable a read as an inexperienced or selfish guy climaxing too early without consideration of his partner.	0
11322	AOOQWMQEJFZ9X	Not even a story, just the beginning of what might be a story. Don't waste your time downloading it .	0
11323	A3EAM5E8X8IV0B	The historical storyline drew me but couldn't  hold my attention for the whole book would be reluctant to recommend this book	0
11324	A29PNP9FW6YA4K	Didn't understand it, I guess I'd have had to read the first book but didn't care for it. Sorry about that	0
11325	AFW2S2ERU54GO	Sorry but not what I expected from Grisham. Couldn't understand what this was all about, not what I expected from such a great author.	0
11326	AIYC32G25QQPU	The first chapter was so confusing that I had to stop reading it.  Too many characters to understand what was going on.	0
11327	A4XB148ESOT1B	A good joke is hard to find.  That is especially true in this book.  These are not good jokes, much less the best.	0
11328	A8B4Y9QWPOP4Q	Just couldn't get into the story after the ok start.Just not worth the space on my kindle. The peek looked ok but the story just didn't measure up.	1
11329	A2GFTBF6NNMBPF	This book reads like an outline with a little bit of dialogue thrown in. Really undercooked and incomplete, very rough draft.	1
11330	A2J8WQHKV75MAS	hated it..too bitchy and too bossy..wanted too like it..but it was soo bad i couldn'teven finish it...	0
11331	A3VQ34Q8V0J9DW	this book did not hold my attention so  therefore I will not be reading any other book by this author.	1
11332	A10S049RIL1LY0	This book seemed to gather information from other books and other sources. Its the same old information. Do not recommend.	1
11333	A3L3003U9XJNAU	This was a short story  that  ends abruptly and simple. I was expecting a more detailed ,excited reading. Seems this book was meant for a very young teenager.	1
11334	AB5DP7AM479QJ	I could not even finish this story. It did not get my attention at all.  I thought it would be a good hot book but i could not finish.	1
11335	AABXUSGGXUY1Q	"This ""short story"" isn't really much of a Romance. Love at first sight? She lies, he gets mad, they love each other, the end. Waste of time"	1
11336	A1GZS3546SOTEG	I have more than 3,000 books in my library. I would not keep this one. Just didn't pull me in so I dropped it a short way in.	1
11337	A2KQI1DGDAO7ZQ	An ok story, Reads like a steven king story, just not as good.  The twist at the end was ok, i could mostly see it coming.	1
11338	A3I3I3T74QXY1T	The one good thing about this book(?) is that it doesn't waste too much time too read. It is just silly, though I do agree with the Star Wars reference.	1
11339	A31FTJRM7LUJPU	Not enough story development and an awkward ending. It needs to fleshed out for improvement. The description of cheerleading is sufficient for an understanding of the subject.	1
11340	A15GNXSFX7IDKJ	Too sweet. Too trite. I didn't want to stck around when the guys with guns arrived. And Great Danes as guard dogs??? Couldn't finish it.	0
11341	A2K82YA7CQN34N	didnt much like	0
11342	A3UWZCXPFK82T6	Just a short children's poem with no real value.  Sorry, but not worth your time or theirs, except simply to get them to read something.	0
11343	ACHALEIKGHKF5	Strictly for beginners... I got this much information shopping for my detector. But.... for those who know basically nothing about detecting.....	1
11344	A77K1B31UAQ29	Stupid game, impossible to figure out how to use it. NOT intuitive. I hated it and regret the purchase completely!	0
11345	A3LYMG98UR1R01	These stories read like assignments for a community center's creative writing class. They were pointless, dry, and wandering. Good thing it was free. I have already deleted it.	0
11346	AOBLHLZYS34IL	"The story was unusual. It ended abruptly and it wasn't clear how the relationship between the ""heroine"" & the ""heroes"" developed."	1
11347	A5UPJYGZRH1WQ	This short story did not have much plot. The characters were not developed, but at least the writing was good. I glad I did not pay for it.	1
11348	A17QMTJ67OZT2D	This book was just ok..Not something that stands out to me. If u don't have anything else.. Go for it	1
11349	AM0ILEFHDGQEW	The writing was very stilted, and there were too many characters having too many affairs. The plot was fairly interesting.	1
11350	AZKYKW0LMHVGS	Just got this because my daughter uses Coconut oil and I was curious about it.  Probably won't ever use it.	0
11351	A1WDBWYTBLSWKN	i dont know just too much for me i like romance and sex but there was not really  a good story line for me	1
11352	A358MBL2EPOLPI	I enjoyed the small amount of natural healing information in this book but was put off by the new age nonsense and the ridiculous views on abortion.	1
11353	ATZEQZ38T6346	A little far-fetched but cute story. I downloaded this as it was free. Not sure if I would pay to buy the sequels but it was entertaining.	1
11354	A11ZKLYVHKFRZL	Another case of you get what you pay for, dumb and not very funny.  Kids might like them.You will want to screen some of the jokes.	0
11355	APKJBP29G0YEQ	I didn't feel the romance whatsoever. It had moments of funny, but mostly it told the story and I didn't feel engaged with the characters.	1
11356	A11KTS2A1VO4A5	There was nothing original in this story. No unexpected twists. No unusual plot. I'm not even sure why the author bothered to write it.	0
11357	A3COJUSKEDTGJ6	Couldn't even get past the 1st chapter. I'm so glad we can get samples before buying. Looking for new authors but she won't be on my list.	0
11358	A18J6LPBVZ3CI0	I was glad to delete it once I finished it.  Quick read, story/plot made it difficult to suspend disbelief.  This was disappointing.	0
11359	A2UH7EMPH4GK2L	OCEAN BURNING did not have enough action to keep me interested. The author needed to develop the plot much sooner.	1
11360	A33MMHW1L7L020	Warm romantic story with great characters. I hope to see of these characters and their town with more involvement with the Inn	1
11361	A3VL1U7AGXJ9GL	This is not a book; not even a short story, merely a chapter.  When I read I want a story not a taste.	1
11362	A1UU3B8OK21OP	I REALY AN TRUELY DID NOT WANT THIS TERRIBLY NASTY BOOK IT WAS AN ACCEDENT THAT IT WAS ORDERD HATE THESE TYPS OF BOOKS	0
11363	A1BMG5R8ZW2CUW	I found this book was pretty much things you knew already but written down into one place. But I pretty much knew diets suck already so...	0

11365	A3Q6M4S928ZOTC	I would not have wasted my money on this book.  It was medico re and some parts were weird.  There is know chemistry at all.  This book flopped for me.	1
11366	A10K4CN7CEA3K0	this story could be a 3 chapter story there is really no connection and story to it.  Lots of loop holes and left me with a &#34;really?&#34;	1
11367	AQAQFVD5TDFGL	It was funny, loving, and simple. I found two typos. I really enjoyed the characters. I loved the mother, she was my favourite person.	1
11368	A10MSMRLNSU8R8	Did not like it at all.it was just like a one night stand I found it to be kind of dumb	0
11369	A1DHC9FF6UAA38	I knew who the stalker was when the character was first introduced.  There is nothing here to set this apart from the hundreds of other short stories	1
11370	A1MIATDUR5714Z	I deleted this ASAP felt dirty down to my soul!  Pure smut...do not go there unless your into pornography, sick.	0
11371	A25BPPKSE4VUPQ	The characters were shallow, plot mundane, and it seems to be written with now surprises, nothing to induce me into looking at the authors other books.	0
11372	A2GZH8EO6U3U5F	Don't fall for it mentioning the Hunger Games in the blurp to get this book is just misleading. Save yourself sometime pass this book up.	0
11373	A3P6W3MW9W7DMG	From a fellow Arkansan Thanks a lot! Sarcasm intended. Way too much drama going down in this part of Arkansas apparently.	1
11374	A3C29TSGOPPU7V	This book was way too short.  It was very disappointing.  However, it was free, so what do you expect from something that is free?	0
11375	A2P4V8YMA5LJ8X	I really wanted to enjoy this book but found myself disappointed. The crudeness of the sex scenes diminished the eroticism, in my opinion.	1
11376	A30J0XSBCCJAIV	Short story...not short enough.Sorry this was entirely too much unneeded description to keep my interest.  Had a good plot but maybe a short play.Shirley Ann	0
11377	A9V2748JS4K8I	I could only read 20% of the book, the story was so boring I had to skip the chapters to reach the end.	1
11378	A245VXKIR0Y8FA	I do love the Amish story, however these bills should be called short stories, not books. I found the content rather poor.	1
11379	A1BUA3LAY7A8ZK	This book was definitely an erotica book. Not really a plot, the characters weren't memorable. It was just a short read.	1
11380	A3ZFKT4U0Q9V0	A very good little picture book.But I think it needs to be a little bit longer,and have a lot more information about the dolphins.	1
11381	A3MK7JXTC29UJO	I did not get past 10pages. Not remotely enjoyable reading and a waste of my time. Luckily for me this book was free.	0
11382	A2KW4G4V0SP8G4	Book was ok but I wouldn't get it again. Interesting what they used to do way back when. Didn't get any new recipes.	1
11383	A1FI8FHTVMQ1XR	The story line was cute but eventually I couldn't concentrate on anything besides the hundreds of spelling and editing mistakes. It was shocking.	1
11384	A1G7GW8DBJ5MB	got the book for my kindle didnt like it after i read the first page not for me didnt enjoy it	1
11385	A1RVWIW0CG0Z3	I hate to sound mean (& believe me I'm being kind), but to quote an oft used review line: If I could give this zero stars, I would have.	0
11386	A2C7W167DVNUKH	Not sure where this story is going. Neither the aunt or Tyler are likeable at this point. The story like the characters is rather abrupt.	1
11387	A1F9JZTN1OVQWV	Too short of a story.  I wanted it to continue and found myself upset that got this.  Too much of a tease.	0
11388	A1WIDTO69N3GCP	WOW, just WOW! What a demeaning, horrific story. Denigrating, vial story ugh this is filth at its worst or best....I'm not quite sure.	0
11389	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	No just no	1
11390	AWENP7QL2IVPI	This was not my cup of tea.  I am glad that it was a free ebook, but I just could not do this at all.	0
11391	A39TY6P1V76LKL	I hate book of samples.  They just leave you hanging.  Read one and left the rest alone.  If you like these things you can read but never buy these.	0
11392	A2KPQK7MNLAOHS	bought it by mistake through the one button buying! so be very careful when you are using that feature on Amazon	0
11393	A3R6PF7C5J7U6T	Save your time and money. Weak plot. This book is nothing special. I would like to have my change back.	0
11394	A1KF8SQ291JDIH	I didn't like the book because it just seemed to drag and I never finished it.  I had cancersomthing  and usually find books that have something in common with me	0
11395	A8GLSUFX1P9XC	i did not like it	0
11396	A2PGZC3SAON1AE	I hated the entire plot, characters etc. And then to find out that this is one book in the series! OMG	0
11397	A2R272ZBWH1C4W	This story was a bit cheesy and about a quarter way through very predictable. It wasn't horrible, but it really wasn't that good either.	1
11398	A2LX3PLMHTYWLL	Self indulgent writing with little skill.  Even though I am a gay man I found the descriptions of the character's social life uninteresting and a little creepy.	0
11399	A248YNZX1RN5OK	About all I got from the book was  bored.Wish I had not started it when I did. Have retried to read it twice...no go	1
11400	A3U461XFE4HOO9	It sounded like something I might enjoy, but guess what I still haven't finished reading it and I bet I never do.	0
11401	A2WJ27JMZU8GPV	This book was not what I had excepted it to be. I feel that it was to short and could given more details.	1
11402	A3MW7NXTELPOBM	I got this because it was free,stories were all right, it was OK but I would not pay for it.	1
11403	A2DM8ISQMH31CF	Really?Not a good story - not well written - not a good story line - and just how dumb are we anyway?	0
11404	A2BX79H27KONN8	There was no real story here and all you got was something to read while you used your vibrator, assuming you don't have the real thing.	1
11405	A287I3KMGD0NQ	Not all of the patterns are viewable, and some of the instructions are missing.	1
11406	A1GVT5TFM6RL37	Skip all of these.  They are so very bad. I deleted them from my kindle as they were not good enough to take up the space.	0
11407	A3NF5O12WHDS1S	This story is of a sad depressed girl, who is afraid of living. This is not what I thought it would be about when I searched for erotica stories. :(	0
11408	AYG4N93AH8FD0	We have the happy conclusion as a preface to the book, then the beginning of a story that stops in the middle of nowhere. This stinks.	0
11409	A1YI8ILV6V4YVH	Overlong, badly written, badly edited (if at all), just couldn't finish it with the best will in the world! Sorry.	0
11410	AWUHOTNL6DJXZ	i like ghost stories to be at least a little scary, and include some ghosts.  You won't find any of these in this book.	0
11411	A1UE07W1TLRSGZ	This story started out rocky and never recovered. The plot was confusing and the characters actions unrealistic. This just didn't feel like a romance to me.	1
11412	A3VHWAM2IM4Z6W	This book is more about history lesson s than a story. It drags on and on with who cares kind of info. Couldn't even finish it.	0
11413	A38UYUQVUINLNW	The good news is that the book was only 99 cents. The bad news is that was too much. Booorrring.	0
11414	A1296TLTPCQ6UF	Had or knew about most of the recipes.  Found a few new thoughts, but would probably be great for a new cook.	1
11415	AM2F0HV0U8IL7	I want my money back.  Do not buy this. I do not know where the 4* and 5*'s came from but they must be family.	0
11416	A163RL57KDVYCC	If you're looking for something similar to 'Sexting Curves' this isnt it. More backstory in that one not so much in this one. Price was right though. Original seemed hotter.	1
11417	A3RZQK6J8TNPM	I have really enjoyed some of the N.N. series books, but this one just left me yawning.  Not enough to it.	0
11418	A1RHJ400LD2UAJ	First story put me to sleep.  The ending was not satisfying.  I'm sure there is a continuation.  But, honestly, not interested.	0
11419	ADKIWW3EK3GWT	This one was just flat. Zara and Ham are hands down my least favorite KA characters. This is probably the only KA book I really haven't liked.	1
11420	A2SBS19PUQ2TY1	This story started off ok, but it kind of fell flat some where in the middle there was spots where it was just to long and it lost my interest.	1
11421	A2TJLSAUYAMY0C	A very short story. Reads like something someone would relate to a stranger while sitting on a bar stool.  Stumble over it, but don't go looking for it.	1
11422	A3BZIIDKRUU88V	I actually finished it, unsure why.  Tons of typos, disjointed paragraphs etc.  would not read the following books or tell anyone to read this one.  Sorry!	1
11423	ANK72JAUJNJJ6	I think thing book was very predictable, i read every other chapter and knew what had happen in the previous one with reading it	1
11424	A2ARW956UKZ1QX	Couldn't get past the first few pages before deleting it from my device. Wouldn't recommend it at all to anyone.	0
11425	A1516JPVQ5BIO8	Gruesome to be in the mind of a psycho. Especially a woman. The story line could have been interesting but was lost on a bad scenario.	1
11426	A35T95CVL2QB9O	Poorly organized, misleading title, no pictures to show reference or completed projects. Don't waste your time or money with this. Terrible.	0
11427	A31PD65UG6QJ9U	It was an alright story I guess nothing really special ok for a quick free read if you haven't got anything better to read which I didn't at the time.	1
11428	A2UZ9S046H61J2	SORRY THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR MEWAS BORING SO MUCH THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME I REGRET THAT I STARTED TO READIT WAS A WAIST OF MY TIME	0
11429	A1PPEVKPZIXH5T	I only read about half the book.  It began to go too much into detail and I felt that made it too boring.  Would have liked more action and interaction.	1
11430	A19ZGAT6IMFY8L	Too detailed the author goes on and on all the tiny details of shopping, shoes, racquet ball, etc also she is whining self absorbed annoying heroine.	1
11431	A3W48YPARSJG86	I like this author , but did not like this story.  I detested the H, and did not care for the h.	1
11432	A25JKYYRJ47QF	I want to rate it 5 stars but Don't know how. Can't for the second book and I would recommend this book to my friend Linda Johnson and Pam Ryan.	0
11433	A5G1RD1IF7MYA	Way too much detail and superfluous conversation. Characters were not developed well, and just not believable. Glad it was free.	1
11434	AFRCVOVCZLVJU	I am sorry, but it was a waste of time.  I love to read, but I did not even finish the book.	0
11435	A2J8WQHKV75MAS	Couldn't finish it :(	0
11436	AXOAQUZYHDGIF	I like shifter romances in general but don't bother paying for this one.	1
11437	A21K7JLZZJISY4	This story was just ok in my mind.  Being married to a celebtiry has ups and downs and you never know what lies  behind.	1
11438	AZLOCW6YBVSLS	Never finished it. Couldnt get passed the predictable format and lack of scene transition. Felt like a preteen took a big girl novel and wrote about things she didnt understand.	1
11439	A38LY6KKVMHN3I	I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time on this.  I was seriously bugged by this Seal who apparently was a superhero with no life.	1
11440	AKD3H4TY6C8D0	This is not the kind of reading that I enjoy. I have never read this author before and probably won't read any others of his in the future.	0
11441	A3R6F3LGKD6IEB	Easy read but not much interest.  It wasn't what I thought it would be.  Maybe it could have had more to it.	1
11442	A1GQ05M3D2DHV4	Expected much more than I got when I bought this book. I stayed with it till the 30 percent point then gave up on it	0
11443	AZMMFZKJB8PV6	Way too shot, i didn't get to connect with any of the character and the story did not hold up.	1
11444	A1AR3JLGHEL3JJ	It's described as an erotic novella.  I've read more erotica in YA romances.  No no and no...just not enough of anything to get you interested.	1
11445	A111BB03XS8K8H	I dont even understand where this story was going.....very confusing. Not the best zombie story I have read. Even though it is very short it is not worth the read	0
11446	A3UZKB1UIYN5XU	I am a fan of strong willed female leads.  This one failed.  Poor character development and not really an original thought involved.	0
11447	A1OHJZ5D2MMVQW	I was curious and picked this book on a whim. Boring,predictable and downright inane.My flight-entertainment was sadly disppointing. Did not finish this book.	0
11448	A2MJ1BW485FJBV	This book had so many grammatical errors I had to stop reading it. It made me frustrated. I would recommend this book.	0
11449	A101RGQP89LYZI	The app states that it is free, but once you download you find that it is not free at all.	0
11450	A3G7OLIC03JCOC	This book was just too much. I could not get into it and stopped reading it. I was disappointed. Not enough to keep me interested.	0
11451	AAGXSY71Z5ZER	although this book does give good informtion, it was not what i was expecting.  i was looking for a book with more details.	1
11452	A2MWP1JD7MCR8R	Lamest book I have ever read. Most like will not be reading any other books by this author. I don't think I even made it through the whole book.	0
11453	A6D9XJYT5LHJ	I stop reading this at 37% I didn't particularity care for any one of the characters, just seem so dull .	0
11454	AE5IA4M4NQLY	If you find the title stupid, then you won't be disappointed in the book. Even the child was an unappealing brat.	0
11455	A387LL6OT2FPOR	I would have liked the book if it lasted more than a paragraph. What a joke!!!!! Do not waste your time.	0
11456	A1B9NNG9AGVSAE	The lead guy hardly speaks, and when he does, it is short answers like a caveman. It was a good read if they could have made him sound better.	1
11457	AU320XTSA034T	This novella was rather predictable and one that didn't serve to keep the interest of the reader.  I won't be reading any more of the Lucy Guardino Thrillers.	1
11458	A1SWFG8OATK6XZ	Too short cliff hanger and I was not impressed. Waste of time really. Won't read the rest of the books.	1
11459	A192C29DJ6Q7V9	It was ok but way to short. Possibly a very good series but not very full of heart. Do the other books cost money?	1
11460	A6F41LLPSPTDQ	i found these recipes not to easy to prepare, i guess they might be for some one with more time	0
11461	A1G3FX3MQXXQ78	I liked the first book I read, Night of the Assassin, but I thought this was more about the cop than the assassin. I got bored	1
11462	A31OOST60GJ86X	I WOULD RECOMMEND A PASS ON THIS ONE.  FOR SOME ARCANE REASON I CAN NOT PUBLISH THIS UNTIL I ADD MORE WORDS	0
11463	A1KFO6L1IIE3AG	Just could NOT get into this author's writing style. Would not recommend. Never even finished the book & that NEVER happens.	0
11464	A23EZTR5P2R0MA	I personally thought this would be a great old classic, yet I was bitterly disappointing with the fancy language, so that I didn't even reach halfway.	0
11465	A1SGCPSQI5D8E4	I did not care for this story. Did not make any sense to me. Going into a sleep to play a game. Way out of the there.	1
11466	ABSVHABZ93XUL	There's no point in bothering with this &#34;book&#34;.  It's somebody's poorly written fantasy. UGH. I wish I had never down loaded it.	0
11467	A2XEM8PKTREYIW	I know the target audience is young adult but the writing is too juvenile even for that target audience. I don't feel the urge to buy book 2.	1
11468	AI4C7LOK05UGT	could have been okay.....was not. started out pretty good but went downhill quick. not hot sex. not connected relationship. characters individually were okay but together....nope.	0
11469	A2YFN8L8R9LTF6	I thought this book was going to be really funny, but mostly the author just complained about bad dates.  I wasn't overly impressed.	1
11470	AAMS5L1FD6U5N	Horrible book - bad concept and author has spelling mistakes throughout book. Waste of money!! avoid!!!!!!!!! Author also will trash talk you if you leave bad review	0
11471	A1T4JXLQE3AFDV	Boring and totally predictable. All 4 stories where exactly the same and I would not recommend this author to anyone.	1
11472	A3N37CP04BEA9O	Formulaic with little originality. Standard flat one dimensional characters. Plot could be written by reader before the book was even partially finished.	1
11473	A2QU7LPC8U14BQ	This didnt seem to be from a guys perspective, not a strait one. The story line is great but needs work and a real guy to help things along.	0
11474	A1KF8SQ291JDIH	I started reading this book because I thought it would be funny but it was stupid so I deleted it	1
11475	A1PFA5HN0ZXQPZ	If you want to read the short story this is great. It gives you a small part of a book then leaves you to buy the rest.	0
11476	A1PGWKMQ63YYGT	This short has the usual twist and turns of fate when extra martial affairs go wrong. It is a typical situation without a suspenseful ending.	1
11477	A3A28H3E8MOAWU	The story started out ok, but it stopped abruptly. It was like the end of a chapter instead of the end of a story. Hate that.	0
11478	ADXVQ79TEBSLG	I don't like books that don't finish you have to buy something else to find out the rest of the book I consider that a rip off.	0
11479	A1RZJ4BBZ4X4AV	"Unless you get it Free, and even then, it is not worthy of your ""reading"" pleasure and time.This writer needs an editor big time."	0
11480	A33O82YBIGZ2JP	This is just a teaser. You are left with the feeling you have been cheated out of the whole story.	1
11481	A6LY77A5J51N4	I didn't care for the book, read it to the end.  The story could of been good if it had went in a few other directions.	1
11482	AOOCDOX9J1OV8	Couldn't even finish it. It lost me when she has two best friends but lets on pick on the other one. Didn't bother to read more.	0
11483	AL8OQ5M67SGHD	I am glad i did not purchase this book, it was more fantasy than i like.  i would not really recomend it for any age.	1
11484	A1D2NRZ6WDALLK	The plot is not so bad, but  there is too much redundancy in wording and rude characters, some editing perhaps?	1
11485	ALVRZ4E2RK4MT	Found it a bit boring and very vain hope I never end up cranky and old an alone. Bit of a let down compared to other Karin slaughter books.	0
11486	AQDOP6M05RXYT	I didn't get this book my daughter did and it was ok I guess but I got rid of it. Wasn't that funny.	1
11487	A1I9FM9YBUA9T3	Such a big disappointment! It was like a bunch of short stories that went no where and did nothing. Don't bother!	0
11488	A13KALJ99PQ7ES	To start with this book had some information that got me interested in gaining more details, then I noticed it pretty much just reiterated the same points.	1
11489	AB32EKTPOJ2LT	i was stuck wondering where the story went. it felt like the plot was just begining to warm up when the book ended.	1
11490	A2M2T7I87RVCCR	I tried a couple of times to get into this story.  Perhaps it is geared towards a younger age group.	1
11491	AQUA7V2QEEZOU	I wanted to give it a chance because it was free, but I guess you get what you pay for.	0
11492	A3SPHHC9CFRF2Q	Cute idea, but didn't work for me. Switches point of view without warning. Excessive use of dialogue tags.  Some grammatical and typographical mistakes.	1
11493	A2YJPWWKYMSGA5	This has some info on basic ideas. I wouldn't say it is a book as it is more of a quick read of a couple of thoughts.	1
11494	A3UPQVI7JXR7X0	It is too hard to get a precise definition that you can use for the word you are looking up.	0
11495	A28REJAM6899K8	The writer had an imagination because I do not know that an affair like this would happen that quickly. And to go to her house at that.	1
11496	A2XZDA4F450DTY	This was not what I expected, I guess because I thought I would get more in the book than I really did.  Some recipes good, tho.	1
11497	A1CF2XZW51HZRP	Not sexy, not entertaining, not well written. The whole thing sort of falls off after the first few pages and doesn't go uphill again at all.	0
11498	A2SC8IKFS3EO0X	This was so uninteresting that I can't even think of anything to say about it. Now they want at least 2o words!	0
11499	A3QL4YAZ22HHZJ	boring. The story was very fast paced and there were a lot of ways it could have been more detailed and interesting to the reader.	1
11500	A1O442QQMJET73	Premise of the book is decent but writing is unimaginative at best. Mostly boring. Would not read this author again.	1
11501	A242YFPONMV18E	While the main character has made the switch, nothing in the description of the novella gave a clue and transgender novellas are not my thing.	0
11502	A3290OP94JQW7Y	The headline I put up top tells the whole story here.  I just couldn't get into this book and I didn't read very far before i quit,	1
11503	AZNA0A1FUZX8V	Dumb de dumb dumb Dumb!! Sorry but it really is. It's out there but it's also predictable. I didn't like it at all.	0
11504	A25SK69E1AXCAO	The story the plot an characters are underdeveloped. Nothing in this story is remotely believable. Feel like I've read this before...	0
11505	A8XX83JKP1PWH	This book was horrible. Could not even finish it. Did not believe any of what I read.	0
11506	A2ESHG835B7765	There was no beginning. There was no ending, and I have no idea what was happening in the middle. 0 star...	0
11507	APSJY7O3R5HNL	It was an interesting idea that could have been summed up in a single sentence. Bodice ripper. Two femmes. Not my style.	0
11508	A3VWX175NZ82II	This book was sick.  Grown men turning young women in to little girls, marrying them and then using spankings as punishment.	0
11509	A1SITVBOE1KA2E	Predictable plot twists. Characters not at all well developed, shallow. Writing style not particularly special. I did finish it but would not reccomend it.	1
11510	A2UFGJCMHUI74C	This was a stupid pretext and boring book.  I wouldn't bother with it.  I didn't find the sex interesting, either...	0
11511	A61TPF208Q1K6	Anyone that expects readers to pay $2.99 for 65 pages shows their only interest is money.  It's insulting to an avid reader.	0
11512	A3SI95QR7LKIJ0	Love the Bible but this didn't work the way it was advertised so going back and forth from one verse to another was hard.	1
11513	A12PAD91Z8VU7D	Cute story not very realistic not very well written. Story line good have been better explained main heroine was annoying	0
11514	A1TY1ILM5T2LO8	This story was not my thing.  Maybe others liked it, but I did not.  I in fact did not finish it	0
11515	A2F0MIJA0O5PW8	nothing much to add. the story had potential but it was lost in the unrealistic and shallow dialogues and plot. very, very poor reading. I gave up after chapter 3	0
11516	A305IQ7UEK2YDG	could not get into this book It was not what I had expected it to be would not want to buy it	1
11517	A30411QNHGSW5Y	Sometimes I keep the freebies on my Kindle even if it wasn't the best.  This one I did not. I don't know, it just wasn't my cup of tea.	1
11518	AKW96ZM9U2UV	This story was so bad. I still do not understand what caught my eye about wanting to read this story.	1
11519	A29T92HFUVM2NT	The title of this book makes no sense after reading the story. The book cost 1$ and after reading it I'm due some change	1
11520	A2V1OAHP56O2NZ	"The word ""puzzle"" was used way to much. I'm not sure who was what and why. I won't be coming back to these stories."	1
11521	AA5FVX2OWISH1	It passes a couple of hours when you don't mind reading something just OK, but it doesn't really draw one in.Very superficial characters.	1
11522	A124LFWVIMXGNI	I couldn't finish it.	1
11523	A3SC4JLAR4IZWL	I'm a fan of Ms. Wick's work so it came asa surprise how this book was. Not something I'd read again	0
11524	A16BPY9PF7K6F2	first part good then she just goes quirky.. didn't make too much since. then just left me up in the air does she write for a living?	0
11525	A1E07PLARCDDQU	I felt like this was a great idea just executed poorly. But hey not every book is a winner for me.	1
11526	A2JH2YC0NWC6MU	Oh what a load of Rubbish this book was it was Just a bunch of pornNot what I expected AT ALL	0
11527	A15XQYHT2V1275	I am very disappointed in this story. It was not at all what I expected and a little bit much for my taste	0
11528	A1G4UPT6FQ61ML	To much repeat's in this book, not what you will expect from the cover both characters are silly. only certain mention of the child, the story line is unbelievable.	0
11529	ATGSAW7SU6C56	Was not into this book found nothing that sounded good nor interesting to me to want to run out and get the ingrediants.	0
11530	AT5OAE4BRSLTM	This was alright just too much description and not enough story. This is good as a free book but not a paid book	1
11531	A23KRI75998D3W	Very slow. Details very boring. Dreaded trying to read it. Made many references to the 70's which I was unfamiliar with	1
11532	A1VMXIMKHUIQDF	Not the best book it was not like she new that much about Amish people idk...... it was kind of one of  those odd books	1
11533	A1WVZWH559FJ82	I was hoping part two would be better but it was about the same. The ending left me hanging... There were too many plot holes.	1
11534	A1WY41KP2PH74R	I found this novel to be like an empty bag.  Nothing came out of it and just a few words to connect the sex scenes.  Never finished it.	0
11535	A1ZZ5767IKUGZ0	It would been a good story, but it got too dark and stormy.....too many people.....too dark , violent and a perverted crime scene.  This warrants a refund..	1
11536	A1EE05KGTY3VY6	What happened? The story went from Jahil to Koshon to Sonny. What? This was a  total waste of time. I would not recommend this at all. Totally incomplete.	0
11537	AT6B6Y8L9Z3AP	How disappointing to get caught up in a good book and find it is merely a couple of small scenes. This isn't a book! Boo Hiss.	0
11538	A3Q1WY0FJQWUHR	somewhat superficial, no real depth to the characters, zombie virus/chemical? not undead, finally gave up reading the third book, not recommended	1
11539	A32LNDP51PI9LV	Seriously; a total waste of money. No plots&#8230; just stuff it full of as much sex as you can and call it a novel.	0
11540	A89LBLNSNZI26	Story was a waste of time and waste of money. The comments persuaded me to purchase it but it was a decision I regretted. Story never really developed.	0
11541	A3U43NRTFNK0VF	Twice!  This type of non editing makes the author seem like a fool.  It's beyond amateur.  I want my money back.	1
11542	A1DKQCC90FY7NX	Took me awhile to realize I do not care forthese prequels.  You might, but I don't.Give it a try........if it's free.  lol	1
11543	A3KZU51S3ETA0F	"Had one of those ideas you think ""hmm... that could be interesting....."" but seemed very immature. Even though it was short I struggled to finish it."	0
11544	A1ENBKLZGXKRED	Just okNot the most interesting plot and lacking detailsStutters along, pretty predictable, not even very good sex scenes from an author with sex in their name	0
11545	AK6Z4WDTZBDXY	It started out good. The ending is a clif hanger. Why? This upsets me, where is the rest of the story. I feel cheated. :(	1
11546	A2LSKD2H9U8N0J	I consider this one a dud I did not care for it  i do not recommend it at all very dissappointed	1
11547	A2XSZG276MYDLP	This was a faced pace story that didn't make to much sense. They go from a feud to some addiction. It was just to strange.	1
11548	A7J3AIV7DEGGY	My revelation? I don't have a hair/ bald head fetish.Who would have known?I could have gotten past that if the story had something else interesting in it. A little boring.	0
11549	A2S5V6QOOK133F	Constant grammar and misuse of words detracted greatly from the plot.  A good editor would make this book more readable.	0
11550	A9LFM8AXZDP4T	The book didn't  hold my attention.  I found it to be very slow getting off the ground.  Characters were just okay ... some interactions confusing.	1
11551	A2AJVE3TTLNZ9D	Not the greatest read ever. The story line didn't flow very well for me. There seemed to be a lot of missing links and inconsistencies.	1
11552	A1K7S7QVPUWTNS	this should be free.  I could have found a free app that has better quality.  Doesn't hold my sons interest.	1
11553	A1T8MJ71STPPC0	Forgettable, hard to get into and stay focussed.  Not a good buy.  Not recommending this author and would not try her again	1
11554	A2EJNC2U1D6HAC	Pretty good start, but needs some editing. Also a really short read, only took me two hours to read. Hope the second book is done better.	1
11555	A2R896KBBW1001	Too much Fantasy to be called a real Western. And then I am told that there are eleven more words required!	0
11556	A2OGQ7IG7Z5AN6	There was nothing new here. I found myself jumping blocks of paragraphs waiting for something to happen. The story needed some conflict or something because it was pretty much vanilla.	1
11557	AD3U7SUD678CA	I can't believe I paid for a book and only got a chapter, don't spend your money on this book!!	0
11558	A1VSQMFE3KLEUJ	Good story, just incredibly way too short! I had it read in under 30 minutes. For that, it should have been a freebie.	0
11559	A1X8YI8EKM8YRA	I am not into bondage so I need to be fair. I never finished reading this book. Too rough for me.	1
11560	AXXNXL2QQNAJZ	Not really my thing. I was thinking this was a normal book. I did not know that  it was eroric.	1
11561	A1O33QJY720MGE	This book needed allot more history I think. To me it just muddled along and was very predictable.  I had trouble staying interested.	0
11562	AN1R238EWIE04	I did not like the characters. It was an okay story but I would not buy anymore of her books.	1
11563	A3AMW5DSI0QTTA	Sorry..Found this book a bit boring. To much happening for Miss Sunshine and not a book I would recommend. Not for me!!!!	1
11564	AXLBQZ1R0AYGT	I liked the cover but was disappointed again with the way it appeared hastily put together, even if fantasy, it should ring 'true'	1
11565	AVV90N8E5OVFG	The overarching story could have been great. But the innuendo and &#34;extra curricular activities&#34; made me stop reading partway through. It was just too much. Not worth it.	1
11566	A13QONG1RD57UW	Not thrilled, I don't like reality shows.	0
11567	A3PEYWZ2QWO4GF	This book was a lighter read than some of her other books and although I would have liked more characte interaction it was still a good book.	1
11568	A2UFFHJPSOLR92	I can't honestly rate this book as I just couldn't get in to it, therefore I never finished reading it.	1
11569	ATM5K2DE5BJBR	I'm sure it would be a good book, I just didn't realize it was only a sample.Just when it started getting good, it ended.	1
11570	A2P3LIKG2H56VD	Even for free it is overpriced. Each story has few details then just one long sex scene, nothing that makes me want to read anymore.	0
11571	AQC8H49GLIS9O	I jus t don't go for gruesome descriptions in a book.  I read for pleasure	1
11572	A2YTZCXVGQDI7M	Stories are short and a bit overdone.  The writing isn't very well done and just isn't much fun to read.	1
11573	A3E7UJFD1SHDBD	Some parts didn't flow. This really did my make sense...because it's so short...don't bother to buy unless free. That's all	1
11574	A3BS2IBJPE6S9T	This book is not to my liking, no sense at all, sorry!	1
11575	A14P4UH613ZFQZ	The story seemed to be a bit drawn out. There wasn't enough content about their relationship once they got together.	1
11576	A1PRXYVNVRA9ER	No sex at all in book. First book to others was disappointed. Good set up but not even a first kiss	0
11577	A1N7ZB1NFPCOIF	Too much sexual situations and not much left to the imagination. It could've been a good book if more romance and not sex was involved.	1
11578	A2X2GHS5G5QU7M	Ok after reading this book I will say it would be one of my fantasies but there won't much more	0
11579	A1T0U8EAIHL6PF	This was a quickie, but unlike most quickies I found this unsatisfying. Two stars.I did not feel the connection between these characters.	1
11580	A3UBUHSX0LZG6O	good potential but just too short. wish there was more background detail.I guess it told the story but it www as too rushed. should have been a free read.	1
11581	A3RVEV25365PQH	The spelling and grammar errors really took away from my enjoyment of this book. I also feel that there  could have been better character development.	1
11582	AAGP2SGUNMU4	This book was not for me, the main character is obnoxious and I couldn't relate at all. This book made me cringe in a very bad way.	0
11583	A277WLH2TQJWD3	it is a little weird reading from a diary style. plus i didn't like her stories. they were like everyday acts and not fantasy.	1
11584	A2QP49AWU6EOI	This was not a good book... no story line  gross content	0
11585	A1DP9LKVRC89LM	I HAD A REALLY HARD TIME READING THIS BOOK. IT DOES NOT FLOW AND IS HARD TO GRASP WHAT IS GOING ON. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS BOOK	1
11586	A1RWGMTAV191FE	Did not meet my expectations after reading other books in the Gaian series seriously lacking character development  and was not interesting in the least	1
11587	A3020DJFARLFHU	I mean like a couple chapters at most.  Nice to have the backup story and as always enjoy yasmines writing but this was a bummer. :(	1
11588	A1RWPHWQL84M36	its more like a comic book not what I expected, The action is like a comic books just a little disapoointing.	1
11589	A3NOYB2S6CCFY	Spelling is atrocious.  I doubt this gal read over the book after she finished it.  She needs to fix it.	1
11590	A12DGHTSKZFYLO	I was expecting more than that. It was very short. It was even boring. Couldn't wait to finish so I could delete it.	1
11591	AIYE98ZCWQUIS	For a short read this was not what i expected. Could have been a really great story had it not been so spliced and diced, as i would call it.	1
11592	A2QGYMSY2RI47A	The title sounded nice and interesting. There was many errors in the writing of this book. I did like the story but was disappointed with the end.	1
11593	A1DHC9FF6UAA38	I can't quite understand the popularity of Katie Reus.  The characters are cliche, the sex mundane, the danger too easily overcome.	1
11594	A1PAVMG8XTV9DF	The storyline was cheesy and the romance was so blah...not enough steam....i didnt really get to know the H/h and it was kinda boring	1
11595	A36QYIOOTCJISP	Sorry Dean, in my opinion, this series was a miss for me.  The story never developed into an interesting read for me.	1
11596	A101U7FNC994O3	Paid way 2 much for this!!!!! Very annoying that authors charge this much for a book that took less then .5 hour	0
11597	A2J2JK9KQYLE5L	Really not impressed... it's just like every other diet book out there... I changed my diet in better ways and saw better results	1
11598	A3HJSIRW9X2AB2	seriously, is this for real?I could barely make it to the end of the sample. so bad. try and see for yourself.	0
11599	ADZ2BT3JLEU8I	It was not great. Didn't read description I guess so wasn't ready for how short it was. I wouldn't really consider it a book.	1
11600	A2VAN6ACQ4L0J8	A very interesting approach to working in the &#34;spook business&#34; as an analyst.  The reader is left wondering if this was the blossom of an idea yet to be developed.	0
11601	AT9UK4MRV4F1Q	The character, Mya was annoying with all of her fears about the relationship. All in all the book was predictable and under developed.	1
11602	AA3E053MRR5RN	Not really a novel - just a study of the outlaw.  Should be in the textbook section.  My husband is an avid western reader but he hated this book.	0
11603	A2OXFQ4XDQ9U7	The space warfare sections are reworks of air battles in WWII or something a bit later. The maneuvers that Smith describes won't work in space.	1
11604	A20UE22HSZO7HD	Not a great story.  Could have been a lot better with a little bit more effort from the writer.  I was really hoping for more when I started it.	0
11605	A3C7FNP5RXB58O	A quick read, and good for in between.For the prize on Amazon a fine read but for me not worthy to recommendate to other readers.	1
11606	A3NALTG52VTTBI	Writing a story about a curse that isn't in effect anymore is not a great idea. Good try though.	1
11607	AB1F4OAN2HKDY	Boring. Doesn't get you engaged with the characters. Thus their encounter is simply sex. Better erotic novella writers on this genre!	0
11608	A39GEZZYHWYTVU	While the war itself for the most part was interesting, the book read like a porn story with WWII thrown in for filler.	1
11609	A1L8IW24MJGGJ3	Unfortunately, I did not like it. It was a corny plot with an even more corny ending. I didn't like it.	0
11610	A2XO97HXAKY61U	I didn't care for the book as it was all a repeat of everything I already knew.  I was hoping for something a little more advanced.	1
11611	A1PYF964GHZGIM	overall good quick read, there was a story line never finished.  Maybe it was and it was so quick I missed it.....ended differently than I thought it would.	1
11612	A3DA70JKXTUK23	Could not finish the book. Quit reading in chapter two.	0
11613	A26IBK0WG8CFZK	I know it was free but I just couldn't get into it. I was extremely bored out of my gourd with this book.	0
11614	A17UQL76OCVR4F	Not a great read. More for teens. Never could get ino the story. Would be unhappy if I had actually paid for it.	1
11615	A184OQ87WARKVF	This book had very little to redeem it.  There was little story and no character developement. Set in Alaska, there was so much potential that was not developed. Disappointing.	0
11616	AXO9L6OMF7P42	This book wasn't up to Robyn's usual style.  I was very  disappointed and would have expected better from her efforts.	0
11617	A2ZECOAM1PKS99	This book was confusing and no proper story line to follow. i felt robbed even though it was for free	0
11618	A40OVUBLU06TZ	Unfortunately, the series didn't improve as I had anticipated. I was hoping the characters would mature, but I was wrong.	1
11619	A7LD1TK5M7VAS	Thank Amazon this book was free because I can delete it and forget about it. Conn, hon I fell asleep.	0
11620	ANQGWQBWY9VT6	I like romance but sex  for the sake of sex is not romance If I had known more about this I would never have downloaded it.	0
11621	A1UTNYFFVJBOUI	Didn't like it. The premise itself, rubbed me the wrong way, and it was executed to grate on every single one of my nerves. Yea, no.	1
11622	A2D46NRMBYLKM2	James Patterson hmmmmm always look forward to your books, I couldn't get two chapters of this one down my throat. I do not like sci-fi ever! YUK	0
11623	A3EDEWSSME5QC6	Not really impressed, not enuf development tween main characters. Brother was a hoot though. I skipped forward alot. Glad it was .99	1
11624	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	This was okay ... Nothing really stood out. I actually had to go back and read some of it to remember what it was about. This is a series.	1
11625	A1IVNFM8M6LOMJ	This book must of been boring because I don't remember  what is was about. I've read all of this authors books and there was only one I really liked &#34;Wounds&#34;.	1
11626	A3K8CRCWD99IDX	Waste even if it was for free not much there and a waste then they want a redickulouis among for more!	0
11627	A2QKFBEZ4QZYNN	I really wish they would stop making &#34;strong&#34; heroines, who are actually just waiting to Submit to some dude, to make their lives whole.  Waste.	0
11628	A8SW390Q5JNJX	It was poorly written and dull.  I finished reading it as I thought it would improve but it did not.	1
11629	A3PSIU8MFQBUP	it was alright, I want the second book. it was sad at times but she is a fighter and so are the brothers	1
11630	A3R0VJG7STZFZM	The story was too unbelievable....the editing was absolutely terrible which greatly contributed to making the book not an enjoyable read....don't waste your money...	0
11631	A3IPX7FBVQVM8N	Sorry it didn't come up to my expectations, to much mumbo jumbo and not enough story. Terrible use of Austen Characters.	1
11632	A2QPGRPP1FWOF7	Not very interesting -- a very predictable plot and outcome. Really did not enjoy this selection.  Not worth the money spent.	1
11633	A37Z8MYR2DUT21	The premiss was good. But the majority of the book felt like it was just too convenient. There wasn't much build up in the relationships to make it believable.	1
11634	A3B7NBPF4VZN6O	so good i did not want the book to end i cant wait till the next one comes out the silver series is fantastic worth reading	0
11635	A15FD2E4BJCB3G	I felt all the stories were just samples half of them didn't even get to the kissing stage before the next stories started a box set should have complete stories	1
11636	A1DE9LILYOGSRB	the story was to short the plot was not fully developed it was not what I expected to read yep I was disapointed	0
11637	A2JXQUJZ41F2S2	The story is weak, the editing needs work, and the characters are unlikable. All in all, this was a disappointing read.	0
11638	A327H7RAYT8KAR	written with just one thing in mend and i just couldnt get very interested in it i didnt like it at all	1
11639	AOKLLFUWRPBYX	Poorly developed stories. Rushed characterizations.  Story lines disjointed.  Not Worth the electrons it took to download it.I do not recommend it.	0

11648	A21QK0Y2CKLEH9	Nothing excellent. The plot is simple and predictable, at times almost infantile. The authors description of battles is quite good. Unnfortunately, good storytelling is negated by a poor plot	1

11798	A217UXM5135D8T	This is a  quick read, but you won't learn anything new and exciting. It is good to spur you on, though.	1
11799	ABI1V8YHNUK87	It was ok, but the author was over the top with the sex bit, she apparently has a real problem there and might want o seek mental help.	1
11800	A1Y550BOFFQQ1P	I did*nt enjoy this novel in fact I did'nt finish it the theme was'nt to my liking at the time I was looking for something uplifting	0
11801	A1YJJ759MB2PDW	Nah, can't say I enjoyed this book too much. Sorry, I have nothing more that can be said about the book	1
11802	A80A5V4QGQQYR	I couldn't get over how big of a jerk Dumont was to actually enjoy the book. The guy was sadistic in his control	0
11803	A144HNNRXT0W1K	Poor plot and unrealistic characters. This book would probably be ok for teens or maybe not. I sure wouldn't recommend this book. Grandma	0
11804	AIM2VEGXRZ0EG	Just don't.  That's all I'm gonna say.  Just don't.  Awful, stupid...I need more words to meet Amazon's requirements for a review...boring.  Done.  Whew!	0
11805	A3GWL3KAA94OA8	I love a good romance but this is just to damn unreal ....sorry but I can't enjoy a unrealistic story like this.	0
11806	A6ZG04TN8WO3E	the story line was bland, I read the reviews and was interested, but the reviews were better than the book!	1
11807	A1ANG1191JS7J1	This book was okay. I definitely would say it isn't worth the money The illustrations were really stinky and basic.	1
11808	A2D1TFXABH8MT7	Not a fan. No real story line. Not for me, short story which had the potential to be something but fell short.	0
11809	A3P3TI0YTZ3J1M	Nothing new, nothing special!  Being free makes it good for reference for the novice cook, but if you are looking for more, you will be sadly disappointed.	1
11810	A3TFBWX5HIL5FD	The book was filled with unrealistic and unbelievable scenarios. And there was not any development of the characters or the story lines. I wouldn't recommend this book to others.	1
11811	A2S3YMM57OHI1J	Lost interest. I have read some great sci fi books, but this one turned me off early. I will come back to it someday, maybe.	1
11812	A1AIX1W30XJ3N6	No real plot line.  Too much sexual innuendo and just not a great fit for what I like to read.	1
11813	A15NZD5WINDQZM	and then within minutes you are at the end  a waste of effort as far as i am concerned	0
11814	A2F9ZT8T0QUXCA	wicked predictable and much too short! new take on the werewolf story, which is probably the only reason I finished the book.	1
11815	A20ZZX2Y23IFKC	Like the book, but don't love it ...  I wasn't too fond of the way the scenes flowed. For some reason I could connect with the characters.	1
11816	A1PN2BIJO6DK87	I started this book several times. Could not get into it at all. Not sure if it is me or what.	1
11817	A2OKRGLH7JIKK7	Seriously ? That's it ? Heck even for free, this was just not a book worth reading as it feels more like an essay than a book.	0
11818	A3UCUIPB87ZFOH	I did not find any useful information in this book. This just waste my time and data plan. Not worth	0
11819	A10QDELF0VZ6HG	Stupid, not sure why I read it to the end. Come on why would a guy do something so stupid. I could think of better ways to get it out.	0
11820	A1K4H14FU2WKXQ	I rated it one star because I felt that it ended to abruptly. Their characters didn't have enough time to mature together. It all happened too quickly.	0
11821	AJM60BA87Y4VZ	Unbelievable.  Everybody is a saint, except those that do wrong and they get away scot free.  Quit reading after a few pages.	0
11822	AJWIK57ZKO8AM	I just could not get into the book it could not hold my interest I had to give up and look at it once again	1
11823	A3RZP4QDYVEO1P	That was not 101 jokes!!! Some of them weren't even jokes at all!! This book was a rip off! I give this book 1 out of 5 stars.	0
11824	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	Interesting plot	1
11825	A1KNY8NXLJNR6T	I hate putting people's hard work down, but this was Crap, I read the first couple of chapters and had to stop and remove it from my reader. Just, blarrrk	0
11826	A1NB8TOO5UKL4T	Petty, angry girls, handsome forgiving, long-suffering suitors, ...this book is aimed at the under 15 crowd with a transparent plot and conclusion.	1
11827	A3703KZSXV6GTO	If you get this book for free then OK.It's actually a sales pitch for a website. It's an ad.Be warned.	0
11828	A2RBBS5KJNYAOX	Not at all what I thought I would be.. it is not what I would call illustrated at all. Disappointed.	0
11829	A2F75O1Y9702R1	I bought this by mistake and wish it would go away. Hope fully now it will!! Not interested in this stuff!!!	0
11830	A20FEEWRFZ6557	I read books to make me happy, laugh and generally make my day - I don't like books that make me sad	0
11831	A3I6K7GHVHSD1V	This was a strange, sad little book.	1
11832	A2V37DTA4UFEIK	"I didn't even finish this book before I deleted it from my Kindle. The writing was just too over-blown for me. ""His evil laugh,"" indeed!"	1
11833	A2LOAMSGEZE5M	I didn't really like it. I enjoy supernatural, sexy reads, but his seemed to be missing something else, can't put my finger on it though	1
11834	A2H19TYZFH5RGY	Too short to give a good review. If this is erotica it sure didn't do a thing for me. So very glad it was a freebie. Boring in my opinion.	0
11835	A2ZITOVYSQM2SG	Can't say there were alot of APPS to choose from.  I could find better APPS just browzing for them on my own	1
11836	A8PA952TJ587J	Juvenile. Cop shares investigative secrets with a group of high schoolers. Really ? Would be entertaining if not so far fetched.	1
11837	A2D7DS1DGAWGVR	Ok only three chapters, a good and easy read but could have went on for a lot longer. too short	0
11838	AFVCTJEO643D	Great start and suckville finish. Have enjoyed a lot of the other books, this one looked like it got typed out in one session.	0
11839	A2C26L2NGS814J	It was not bad. It was too short of story. Best for children but not one I will keep reading.	1
11840	A2BOZ9517ZMP2E	This was my first & might be my last time reading this author's work it was just okay to me nothing more or less	1
11841	A2LLWCQVYKYF0F	to much explicit sex and foul language in this for me, as my age and background would probably be predictable	1
11842	A3O8Z7PV3EM5VK	Very disappointing, very boring no imagination whatsoever! Unrealistic plot, such a wannabe kinda lifestyle. Will not follow up on the next book.	0
11843	A2BN68GSQYV9TL	Started to read it but it was too &#34;cutesy&#34; or something.  Trying to hard to be funny.  I deleted it.  It may have gotten better but I'll never know.	1

11846	A3KWLE7H7QYUOJ	it leads you to think that this app is free it is not youare just signing up for a two week trial be careful.	0
11847	A15IRDQ0O6KSNL	.....but the writer left out great details!  Sparked my interest but fell short!  This could have been a great read if he had chosen 10-15 legends and elaborated on them.	1
11848	A3843LJV1TSW85	This story was pretty boring and not nearly enough sex to be called erotica. No excitement, no story line just bad writing all the way around.	1
11849	A3HGWIBOFVXA2F	The stories seemed kind of repetitive, then I stopped reading. But interesting enough if you just want to kill time.	1
11850	A2B430879UJXAA	Only the first three chapters not the complete. When I got it I was expecting a complete book. Nothing was said about this being a preview. Not well done.	0
11851	A2KI4TRB8AUD3J	Well, very ridiculous book, could not even finish it.Good luck to anyone who reads it and likes it.Cannot recommend.	0
11852	A2UOSJVCFGJG0H	Why is this in a Christian Fiction section???? It is definitely NOT Christian: graphic sex and swearing. I am embarrassed to even have it in my archives.	0
11853	A1LD1E122SZNVU	Don't read erotic but people that do , good read.  Would recommend to people that read erotic. Not my cup of tea!	1
11854	A190IDZ5VTUHJM	I usually love Entagled books but this one feel short. So short that I couldnt bring myself to finish it.  Not worth the money.	0
11855	A9DAPOWABZW2E	Wasn't clear several spelling errors and very disjointed. Maybe better next time will giveAnother chance. Second time is a charm.	1
11856	ATOLB0D3X3NRW	I don't know why I didn't like this. I guess I didn't feel that the stories and the recipes were linked or relevant.I deleted this book	1
11857	A2ZNCX2QLAE49L	Totally did not like this at all! Sorry it was just not my thing. Not even sure why I read the whole book, except that it was short.	0
11858	A1I7VZM3LCG33M	Predictable romantic short story.  Prequel to the Pajaro Bay series.Appreciate that there is no gratuitous or explicit sex in these stories.	1
11859	A3U3ARNFTK9GSI	I kept waiting for it to pick up and give me the excitement all the other reviewers said they had experienced but it never made it there for me.	1
11860	A3CPQ7V88MDVYU	I remember why I don't read modern romances -- way too much mental angst and too little story with pages of pre-sex tension.  Not my cup of tea.	0
11861	A34CRZDZ2FVJ6W	I thought the work was boring and a bit repetitive.  I also had no connection to the characters and got bored half way through.	0
11862	A3OS3HXUN89F7B	Did not grab me and hold my interest. This was a new author for me and I am willing to remain open- minded and try some of his other works.	1
11863	A3SN8H1V126IIY	This book was so slow to start that it just didn't grab me and make me have any desire to continue to read just to get to any good part.	1
11864	AHAVJB25L0MYK	Stupid, dumb, idiotic. One of the least appealing books I have ever read. I would not recommend it to anyone.	0
11865	A1PPL5QJA784EN	This is a very easy mystery to read & solve. It's a little corny & too predictable for my tastes. Won't be buying more of they'd series.	1
11866	AORZT3DEMRZLU	The writing was terrible, the grammer was terrible, the plot was ridiculous and the bad stereotypes were the only things done well.	0
11867	A3TJOBVQ95HK9Z	Book is a little to short and where is the erotica. Book has no real plot and takes you no where. A disappointment.	1
11868	A3HK11F4KT2V93	But at times the author couldn't' keep their own character's straight. Good thing it was a simple story without many characters.  Too easy to actually..	0
11869	A1WRQ2XRF7OXZC	This has the making of a good story but the book ended so abuptly and ive seen no new book to show where the story goes. Quiet dissapointed	1
11870	A23OO7DT31PCRA	I wasn't into this type of book right from the start.  The writer left nothing to your imagination, particually when writing about sex.	1
11871	A1AEP2DFI28WJE	Not the quality of read I was expecting, I had to put it down several times and come v=back to it to finish the book.	1
11872	A2CCO4HWIFOP5J	Could have been for and by eight year olds. Not much there. As a matter of fact, I deleted it from my Fire about 1/3 finished.	0
11873	A29TSW2VAFK7XU	I've read better labels on cans at the supermarket.  Very rushed, very choppy, not like the description ... I was very disappointed	0
11874	A3CM6AH2KNB09O	I tried to read this book but I just couldn't get into it. I only got it because it was free on Kindle, I so glad I didn't buy it!	1
11875	AU4VVTIP9A00J	I hated this book. I can't stand it! It's disgusting and uses way too much fowl language. I would never read this.	0
11876	A3C01CTF8R08T1	I rated this book only two stars because it was way too short.  There wasn't enough detail to even develop any opinion about either of the characters.	1
11877	AECR5NYQEB2XW	I honestly couldn't finish the book. It reads as if it was written by a horny high school student. I'm glad I got the book for free	0
11878	AL4V2IZ5D9AOO	I was not pleased with this book...I couldn't understand what were the perks of being part of the YCS...honestly this was a horrible book	0
11879	A3DMZQBWIW697N	This book just never got started for me. Bored from page one. Very techie and geeky - not enough detail, storyline, or character development for my taste.	0
11880	A2ON93S0H2ELTU	I just couldn't get into this book. I tried really hard but the author was just t skin g yo long to get the story out.	1
11881	A1SUPQ1LUEPZ8A	I love the Jeff Resnick mysteries but Bah! HUMBUG wasn't even long enough to be called a short story. It would have made a good story too.	1
11882	A273C4VKUOHZ2	Just didn't truly interest me & I don't own a smoothie machine (thought I could use blender).  Those who already make smoothies would probably like this book.	0
11883	A3M5JMKPMAUDF3	It is so boring that I could not finish, I lost my money up buying, not worth reading, a crappy plot	0
11884	AZMMFZKJB8PV6	I was so bored with this novel i gave up after the 10th page, maybe it's just me but i wasn't captivated or pulled in by the story .	0
11885	A3FMWF7J8HTEOM	I started this book and just could not finish it. I read all the other books and enjoyed them but something about this one just did not keep my interest.	0
11886	A3Q1KLWRFQ59JM	Read it! Worked hard to finish it. It would likely be a great novel for someone that has never read Stan Lynde or Elmer Kelton.	1
11887	AWTCYSKCMQ0IW	As a avid reader I think I expected something different.  It started to slow and didn't hold my attention.  I may not have read enough to give an opinion.	1
11888	A2QZFM38IQ5WTA	It was so interesting that I do not remenber any part of it. I went back and looked at it and decieded it was grade school prose that was listedwrong.	1
11889	A1JCVLU1YXKNRA	There were so many GROSS grammatical errors.  Absolutely no character development.  Must have been written by someone in elementary school!	0
11890	A87NX1KT7ITPU	Cookbook has cover page plus two more. Hey! It's free but this is ridiculous!!??!! 2 pages?? Then goes to Write  Review page.	0
11891	A8SL036EF8G34	Simply put... after such a heroic character was built up since book one i am disappointed at such a poorly ended legacy	0
11892	A3QJY01AFZXROT	It is not often that I read something and am sorry that I did.  The time spent reading this is one of those times.	0
11893	A50JXGOVMCTQ9	So basically just a book with a whole bunch of Halloween costumes maybe good for age two and younger, but not older	0
11894	A3NALTG52VTTBI	This made about as much sense as the first one but wasn't nearly as entertaining.It's a huge summery and then it just becomes pwp.	0
11895	A1F03GYMYT0014	For a complete newbie there is some helpful advice, but on the whole very repetitive with nothing new to offer.	1
11896	A2MSHRHP6O5O26	This one wasn't what I thought it was gonna be,m so I never finshed it, I thought it would give you ways to loose weight	0
11897	AOBMPSNXE1ZLA	Simply one of the most horrid stories I have ever read. Don't bother. The subject is one that could have been good as the title implies.	0
11898	A31X0GK7XMM59F	It wasn't what I expected, was long and drawn out, loved the movie but not the book.  Kept putting me to sleep.	1
11899	A2W1YXC6QT3KGZ	Although they are good lessons, my children were way to young to understand the moral of the stories. It wasn't age appropriate.	0
11900	A3KT91ZPDSWAR1	I do not have The Ultimate Sacrifice by Anthony Fields . This is irritating when I purchased this box set with intentions on reading it .	1
11901	A1NB5S5340S9TN	I found it extremely difficult to get into. Can't really complain only cost me .99 cents. gave it a go.	0
11902	A2U0R04KZZLHAW	This book started off pretty good then just became nasty but not just freaky nasty but vomit in your mouth nasty......	0
11903	A12KCJLYM0M5F1	It tried to be a good read but not enough details in some parts and too much in others.Not a good read forme.	0
11904	A2ZTLL9J88DR0H	A fairytale based on queens view. It could have been great if i didnt feel like she was ranting the whole time.	1
11905	A22XZQ37UMYQLL	ok read. all over the place at times but hey, you get what you pay for. would recommend if you're looking for a quick story	1
11906	A2TUBWFNQY8BVV	I used both sheets and was unable to get them on without bubbles and the end not sticking to my kindle.	0
11907	A1SGJA8YM2F26Z	Could not get into the book. The language was awful. Started downhill from page one. I am sure the authors tried but I did not care for their work	0
11908	A17VKLLLD52NCK	This offer was very misleading to people looking to try their magazine before buying,  therefore. I didn't subscribe to this magazine.	0
11909	A3SKUO2ETGYDDV	Sorry :( I just could not get into this book. The beginning drug.	1
11910	A1ZZ5767IKUGZ0	It starts out all nice and quaint. Then lures you into a quiet trap. With odd twists and turns, by then it is too late.	1
11911	A22AKRDJXHHFTA	Absolutely pointless. Really, all it is stupid conversations. Like one is cool, but it gets so boring. I don't recommend it.	1
11912	A1XO7OB28AW388	This had all the makings of a great book, but the continuousgrammar and punctuation mistakes was beyond  annoying. I finally skipped to the end .	1
11913	A3ISLJLMCU94FV	Although the storyline is interesting, the writing is very choppy and leaves too much for the reader to fill in. This was not the thriller I expected.	1
11914	A15ACQO5C7VMPB	...this book was written...  Last time I read &#34;it&#34; was around Bien Dien Phu and Tet Offensive.  I'm not sure anything was changed except for some weapon descriptions...	1
11915	ABF1WDL89HOJR	Chika turns into a bit of a harlot. Woo. She figures out what most women with a sense of intelligence already know: sex sells.	0
11916	A1ZSJXJXNA0FL5	You lost me with this story .too short. Characters do not not interact with each other. Story not developed. This one missed the mark.	1
11917	A1DU6VOYLF7QK8	It's a very nice story but it is too fast paced. Almost like it was written in a day. At least it was a free book.	1
11918	A2KE0TU7XK89QE	It was just an ok read for meMight read from this author again.It was too short ,felt like the story was rushed.	1
11919	A3D5KTW6RZB7RV	Although it gave you a lot of detail in the beginning it left you hanging about why everything was the way it was !	1
11920	AFIIZNIYE5GCB	this book is just sex and no content needs to have more of a plot along with the sex.  not happy with book	1
11921	ARGY275IRUE4W	I love boxing & erotica. It started out strong, then I lost interest. Good writing, but the plot needs more work.	1
11922	A7BO2QI884WCE	This book was free.  Great idea but poor in the execution.  It should have had an editor. Who does recipes like this?	0
11923	A3JH1L2JTX27EX	Too wordy, too slow, I don't know I just couldn't get thru it.  The way it was written was boring.  I'm just saying....	1
11924	ABQTQB1O09QGT	"This is what I call a ""just okay"" read. If you do short stories then maybe this is for you."	1
11925	A1WA050KLUJKED	This book was trash!  It was all over the place from start to finish didn't really make sense I wouldn't buy part two at all sorry	0
11926	A1DHC9FF6UAA38	If, after reading a book, one cannot remember it at all, that's a problem.  No memorable characters, action scenes, or sex.	1
11927	A3NTQJBUEDS9N7	More like a few pages, the premise was interesting but if you read the blurb you have literally read the entire thing. Don't waste your time.	0
11928	A3U1DCM4843JCX	I have known anyone with memory loss . I was an interesting read.It made me more interested in traveling to N we Zealand.	0
11929	A3DQEJ3X4VYAO2	This is a silly book about silly people.  It was very predictable and not very entertaining.  I do not recommend this book.	0
11930	AB8HX628HHQSV	This book was so boring I couldn't even finish the whole thing I stopped at 52% The first one was much better the drama also seemed at bit forced.	1
11931	A3VK1BYVQEK171	Stupidest book ever. I hope to never find a more juvenile, puerile or idiotic book. The author should be ashamed.	0
11932	A280EBTOBXQAUQ	Please put something in the title or description letting readers know that this book belongs in a religious category.  Too preachy for me.	0

11934	A22BYOUXCKRUB4	I didn't care for this book too much the characters and the story line was just unrealistic. Happy it was free	1
11935	A2B9C3FMYW18UN	This box set was ok. The characters were good and the story line was ok. I recommend this book to everyone.	1
11936	A1HIRR5ZZ9OO01	The book started off good and looked very promising but fell short really fast. I don't understand why everything was basically told to us after the fact.	1
11937	AQ51HCSUCPTUC	Are you kidding me? I couldn't conceive of the human race just giving in to a alien invasion without a whimper.  Sad.	0
11938	A1D10TA6YKMTAB	I was about to give it 3 stars but then no, it was a good plot at first but then I didn't like teh story. Sorry.	1
11939	A1EQXNK9NO40PR	Not what i expected. ok but not a favorite.  would probably not buy another book by this author as it was slightly boring	1
11940	A2RP463GMQCQGC	It was not a bad book but not as hot as I thought it would be.  A sweet story line.	0
11941	ATQMNZLC7983W	I thought I was going to have inexpensive access to the magazine, but this app is just the tip of the iceberg.  You get what you pay for.	1
11942	A2DZ6GYGVJYBWZ	There was no chemistry between characters. This was a very unrealistic romance. Romance novels are fun to read because you romanticize the characters this wasn't romantic at all.	1
11943	A2ZN55YFFC3UQM	Takes a bit of getting into which is not Saxon,s way of starting a story but well worth the wait. I will be waiting for the next instalment	0
11944	A2XLBIHL2F7VXI	It was okay, the cover of the book is not what the main characters are described as, Kind of disappointing. Really couldn't get into the book.	1
11945	A2QT0NV2JL4MMT	Just a piece of a story. Not a great purchase.	0
11946	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	I could not finish this book. Another story that left me bored out of my mind. I can't and won't finish it.	0
11947	A2K4Z3DECXJSHX	I guess I am just a happier ending kind of person. This story started out sucking me in and then ended with me wondering why.?	1
11948	A30Q5OQ9BJN5P6	I felt the story was meant for teenagers. It just did't get or hold my attention. The story line was OK but, it went on and on about nothing.	1
11949	A1Z0WP85TOSM73	Plot could have worked with writing above 6th-grade level.  Completely unedited.  Not worth any purchase price.	0
11950	A2BGKGUI30NP86	No knowledge of firearms. Really bugs me when writers write about things they no nothing about. Poor plot, poor writing, I gave it two stars due to fairly cognitive spelling.	1
11951	A33H2FIN6KTV1T	A sweet story about a young girl left alone and the consequences she faces when she tries to treat him after he is shot.	1
11952	ACLTI6VOZVPMM	Cant really get into it. Not really to my likeing.	1
11953	A2UOE31CCIAKNX	Not sure what happened but this is only like half of the first book instead of the new one it's supposed to be!!!!	0
11954	A1A0NZX9L7UY29	I love SF but not even the setting can save this story.The story and characters don't make me care.Couldn't finish it	0
11955	A2VXHH0ZZ1TB5P	This was memorable; however, I couldn't get into it for some reason.  Perhaps it was because I didn't care for the protagonist.	1
11956	A32ZVSBGHYUFLY	The only thing that I can say is BORING! I couldn't even finish it (although I tried) It's just plain silly	0
11957	A18557DMNO3UUG	I didn't' learn anything new from reading this book, definitely not uncommon strategies.	1
11958	A1U6WOEYM48I4V	IM A BIG FAN OF THIS AUTHOR BUT THIS ONE JUST DIDNT DO IT FOR ME. I EXPECTED MORE; VERY DISAPPOINTED	0
11959	AEAWAL2C77OCV	Reminds me of the Celestine Prophecy the way the girls keep having visions.  Psychic FBI agents.  Come on!  Story ended on a yawn.	0
11960	A3BEEZNJPVWFOF	Not that great. I have read better. Short b rated book. I'm sure it can be made better but until then I don't recommend it.	1
11961	A2O7SS3CI6ZEHO	An enterprising approach to the old police officer storyline with just the right amount of light bondage to be endured	1
11962	A1F6VYXBX59WI9	Avery nice short story.I liked the characters and the way they remember one another and the ending.Well done keep writing.SINCERELY,ARLENE  LEMIRE	1
11963	A16W2JPT6X4SUW	Maybe I just read too many Christmas stories this year. I have decided I like the corny cozy up kind.	1
11964	A3GYU424KPHR16	Horrible! Slaughter, not expecting that! That God Thu  was free if I would have paid money I would have been loaded!	0
11965	A309FUO9AZ07XC	While somewhat intriguing, I'd have thought a History major would at least have a better grasp of grammar. I recommend a review of &#34;Elements of Style.&#34;	0
11966	A3G5BIFX6VS1OP	This book was very good , however the ending left me slightly confused. Is there a second part ? If so I would really enjoy reading it.	1
11967	A1AQSD8ZF1F5VF	THE DAMN BOOK WAS SO SHORT THAT IT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE CHAPTERS. HOW STUPID WAS THAT..SOOO DISAPPOINTED NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE BUYING ANY MORE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR	0
11968	A1KF8SQ291JDIH	It just seemed like a teenager book and a lot of the drug stuff they were doing didn't get my intrest	1
11969	AECD1QOMZ2F2I	I like mysteries, and I don't mind some romance in them. But this one seemed more like a romance novel with some mystery in it. Not really my style.	1
11970	A3KKQIIVWKBRRG	The rhymes in this book make absolutely no sense. I'd be embarrassed to put this out there for others to read.	0
11971	A3D2FLC4Y6OP9A	Confusing plot, awful writing. Stopped reading at page 5 couldn't continue. Save yourself the trouble and read elsewhere. Burn it.	0
11972	A1CN6V9J4OWJR1	THE BOOK IS VERY SLOW AND DOESN'T ACHIEVE THE STATUS OF THRILLER; IN OCCASIONS CHARACTERS DON'T HAVE A SPEC OF NOTION ABOUT THEIR INTERRELATION WITH THE OTHER CHARACTERS.	1
11973	A65RZ4ET22H6O	I could not get into this book at all. It didn't hold my attention. Good thing it was free. I read the first two chapters and archived it.	0
11974	A37NWIYG5GXKLV	Just could not get into this book.  I like a good Zombie read as much as the next guy, but this was not for me.	1
11975	AIAT48CROJ7AZ	The story was like so many shifter stories, predictable and common. Maybe if it were longer in order to get to know the characters but who knows.	0
11976	A22GGHISKRVAOX	I don't normally enjoy literature written in the third person, and this book was no exception, being unreadable and hard to follow.	1
11977	A386GXFTMCBFC	Story was hard to read and plot slow to develop. Read three chapters then gave up. Don't think I will read anything else by this author.	1
11978	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	Didn't like the plot	1
11979	A44IMNYE70395	I usually love Hill's books but this failed to resonate with me. Pick something else to read. I'm waiting for his next offering.	0
11980	A2XNM4XSHDX79H	Slow with not much excitement. Short story, not very interesting doesn't have the wow factor. But okay to pass time.	1
11981	A3R4BKY8TUESYV	this book is so stupid its not even funny. OLDER WOMAN YOUNG GUY OK BUT IT END TO FAST AND IT MADE NO SENSE. saw other parts but nope	0
11982	A3371MJVGV7QGG	I have never been interested in vampire romance stories, so I really can't fairly review this book for others who might be interested in it.	1
11983	AOLSQRW1U2STV	This book has potential but I wished it was edited. It is very disconcerting to be reading and read something that is spelled incorrectly.	1
11984	A29RD51DHVH10D	It's a nice love story by a black writer.  The men are sexy as HELL. He could be any woman perfect man	0
11985	AXN99ZP1ZZF68	This was one of those recommended by what I've ordered.  It was not what I usually read. I read it all but was not very interested..	1
11986	A2TGJ1KVU3YX7E	I is one of the worst novels I have ever had the misfortune to read. My recommendation: Do not waste your money on this book.	0
11987	AFITCO8MIFCHV	These jokes are pretty dumb.  My kids barely cracked a smile.  There aren't very many jokes in here.  I think two were kind of funny.  Waste of time to read.	1
11988	A1N1ZUU0YCST06	Silly says it all. Amazon wants twenty words. Save your money. It's about an old married couple that doesn't get along. In the end they share a toothpick.	1
11989	A3OCKJ3WL1IVRI	the story line wasn't bad but this is not my type of book. didn't know was short stories haven't even completed it	1
11990	ARL2OGQDVPVKE	This is not bad but there is no point to it, yes you get to read about six days before everything happened but there's nothing really worth knowing.	1
11991	A1X5LXRF8XLXZW	It maybe a good book, but I just could not get interested in it.  I may or may not try another.	1
11992	A2JQVCPI9HC72W	Mousy woman captures attention and love of lothario after being ignored by him for years?  Implausible.  Heroine to wimpy to admire--liked her friend like better.	1
11993	A9JRUFTZLYGL6	Th story could have been good. The outline was good. The execution was not. Very disappointed. At least it was cheap	0
11994	A44MQ7CODU3PK	Storyline could have been better and it was slow. It took to long to get to the threesome. As long as it it VERY cheap it is somewhat worth it.	1
11995	AE3EQK9EHP2DF	Asylum was not suspenseful and did not have me eager to read more. I love a good suspense novel and this was not one.	1
11996	ALD313TJYN1F7	This book just made me confused as to which world I was in. Why would the author write it as though there are 2 different girls	1
11997	A13DG58JPYH579	The stories in and of themselves were okay, nothing earth shattering, I guess they were too much alon the lines of traditional trashy romance for me to really get into.	1
11998	AP24Y4ZZUDN7	"Stupid ""ending""This is a short story to TRY and get you hooked. Very happy it was free, I would be very upset if I had to pay for that."	0
11999	A2UAS6OGCR8IUG	Read this in 2 hours that I'll never get back.  I have read other books about Bette Davis and this book had nothing new.  Sorry I wasted the money.	0
12000	A1L6EMVO8SNSED	horrible dark series that goes no where. It is almost unbelievable that it continues to get worse with each book. I quit reading this series.	0
12001	A2WB5LJ9IZSPD	I bought the book before this which was okay.  I tried to read this one and couldn't get past the first couple chapters.  I wound up deleting from my library.	1
12002	A80XPBEI175QG	The Book wasn't very good and I found myself skipping chapters because it was boring. I won't finish the series but it was an okay book.	1
12003	A1ESF76N9NLS0P	The book was nearly over before it began.  I am upset that I wasted my time with this.  Just a very vague overview.  2 stars	1
12004	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	First of many possible books.. Told from the make point of veiw.  But also a finding lost love story.  Not terrible	1
12005	A2UQ2UHZIIK4D7	this book was boring I had to fight from going to sleep the cover was more interesting then the book ....	0
12006	A3TTWMELNTW018	What I didn't like about it was how the author just scramble everything jumping from this person to the next person I don't think I will read part 2	1
12007	A28REJAM6899K8	Just a quick something to read. Had to figure out that she was the same person and she seemed to be fighting off something.	1
12008	A32O1879P47WUL	Not enough info about the results of the recipes. Every recipe sent you to the stove...I don't do stoves, LOL.  Not for me but may be for you.	1
12009	A2W225KVGR9EYT	Nothing special about the book. I actually wanted to stop reading it half way through but I kept at it.	1
12010	A37Y1IPBIR51JG	no rush to get this one over it was not for me it missed in the story plot and development	0
12011	AR1O0GUNLY45V	I did not like this book. Way to much crazy stuff going on so i would give it 2  1/2 star rating.	1
12012	A2LOHSNIV5E4QT	The story had possibilities but got preachy.  This book is geared for young adults, not the mature reader.  I just barely finished it.  Will not read any sequels.	1
12013	A1T7603WNK1IMA	Thought the book had a lot of potential for a deeper story .loved the characters but it felt rushed. I felt kind of cheated.	1
12014	A1GQ96G63ZEIJ0	Obviously it was a short story, but I think it might have been better if it was a bit more developed.	1
12015	A2ATFKPJX63R0F	Its a good book but , i was expecting more . Some of you might like it more than i did	0
12016	A3B1OTX01984P6	It's not.  There are 2 or 3 - brownies and cake.  It's readable in a couple minutes, little interesting, but should certainly not be something you pay for.	1
12017	A2L6ZFMP95ZA2B	I read about two or three chapters of this book before I gave up and deleted it from my reading list.	1
12018	A3P29QHVZ6JWV8	If you like period pieces you might like this but I honestly couldn't finish the book.  To annoying and completely unbelieveable.	0
12019	A2Q95CRI8CONPE	Not recommended. This was a free read, thankfully. Boring. Not even worth the read for a free book. Skip it.	1
12020	A153CLP1R55I8V	It is a very short, to short, for the money.  There are many typos and not  much to the story line.  S don't waste your money or time!!!	0
12021	AMRY8K73SGO7G	I read this but did not like it.  Lots of swearing and sex. Recieved complimentary copy for review. Story line was ok.	1
12022	A2MWP1JD7MCR8R	Was really disappointed in this book, she usually has some good stories but I didn't care for this one at all.	0
12023	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	We all know the horrors of the Shoah. We grieve for all the victims dead or alive. I cannot enjoy a book with one sad story after another.	1
12024	A3G77OWMOIE5SY	I DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO READ THIS BOOK YET BUT TRUE TO ZANE FORM I KNOW ITS GONNA BE A GOOD READ	0
12025	A1G4J5F0J0JMXR	Interesting read for a short story, but on an expected line. Surmise to say it was a worthy reading story.	1
12026	ACGVE9N7DXHK9	The writing was idiotic ... everything was sex and that was the story.  I actually expect something more - like real characters and a real plot !	0
12027	A4R474OOGSNYV	WAS AN OK READ COULD OF PUT MORE IMAGINATION INTO THE STORY LINES NEEDED TO ADD MORE TO THE STORY TO KEEP THE INTERESTING	1
12028	A2KMIMO72BUQEY	So Darrell's lack of guts gets two people killed. Not very smart, should have shot the bad guys to start with. COWBOY UP.	1
12029	AMZIH8FGCPB0U	My review of this item is the same as the Micro usb  Works for awhile then doesnt.  Someone needs to work on improving the longivity.	1
12030	A29VBRXHB3BL7E	Today is 2/17/14. Deal says ends 2/18/14.  Giving 1 Starr not on book but on deal that ended too soon.	0
12031	A2HE4RLFHA3H0M	Strange book didn't understand the plot, thought it was funny at first then it got strange. Hopefully it will be more readily understandable later on.	1
12032	AH9AKW3K9BPSX	Jumped into to fast!  Reader didn't know what was going on.  Intriguing.Not sure I would read another book of this author. My opinion only!	1
12033	A1ECCITRSS2SKB	Though an intersting book, there were too many crochet patterns and very few knitting.  As a knitter it was a disappointment, but I can see crocheters enjoying it.	1
12034	A1IIPL5A3UCIXQ	Unexplained temper tantrums from shallow characters make for a fluffy uninteresting read.  It feels underdeveloped (especially the first half) and never really made me care about the characters.	1
12035	AYHPKLHKF8FHW	Love contemporary romance.....but didn't like this.  It was odd and abruptly turned from one thing to the next.  I suggest you move onto something else.	0
12036	A2WD0WFFAW7R61	Some of the stories are ok and some are just bad.  Not worth your time to read even if you get for free.	1
12037	A3R39CQO7P2FX2	This book does not have a lot of information on anything with gluten free cooking never buying from this author again.	0
12038	A36Y0LXF8PUI7W	What the heck! I am truly disappointed that the book ended with so many questions unanswered. Don't waste your time even though it is free.	1
12039	A37EQW3A3VFL3M	I  believe in Angels, I'm sure I have one.  I did not believe in this contrived manuscript. Read her Sterling Redmond.	0
12040	A8KE7GWGNLARJ	I did not notice that t his book was only 32pages  long before I purchased it,.that is to short in my mind.	1
12041	A18MG1GPSEAPE9	it was highly recommended for zentanglers... well its just a book that i dont want to read with some zentangle art work... BIG DEAL	0
12042	A3KCT9YXRCCADA	This is not my style of reading. The character was too self absorbed, he mentioned his body part several times, I guess that's a guy thing.	1
12043	A2SCMJOL9Y9Y45	The characters had more sex. That's it. Nothing else changed. So if you like reading about slightly PG sex, go for it. Otherwise it's a pretty pointless, dull, read.	0
12044	A31JHRS2D7QCGS	I've read other series by H.P. Mallory and enjoyed them, but this book was poorly written and flat.  The premise seemed fantastic, but it never got off the ground.	1
12045	A57044N0412EJ	I could not master the 16 chapters of instructions.  It was not the product that I needed or wanted.  It was sent back!	1
12046	AOKLLFUWRPBYX	An interesting format, but a wonky read.  The CIA characters are uninteresting, and the Iraqui characters are underdeveloped.  It was not an enjoyable read	1
12047	A2EZMA9HXMKLAY	Overall it was an interesting story. Extremely short but very entertaining. The ending was sick if u real think about it.	1
12048	A1GH5U5IM2CWBW	Poor grammar, misspelled words, bad punctuation and very trite. Get a proof reader or use a spell checker! Not worth the effort to download.	0
12049	A3PLPJLCHP2S4L	I have tried everything to delete this book from my kindle andi just cannot get it to delete. I have tried everything.	0
12050	AEJ0NW3NH3DVT	I was curious about this diet. If you want to eat like a cave man go for it, I don't think it is helpful today.	0
12051	AMXIF9QHS0V09	"dont even think I finished it.  hard to review it really not my cup of tea. I think I'd just finished reading ""room"" and was looking for something similar"	0
12052	A3B8NBK1HF953R	Didn't hit the mark.Fell short and not much of a story line. Didn't keep my attention for long. Just do not like it.	1
12053	A278LJ1S4I282B	Pointless short story with shallow predictable  characters.  Wasted 15 minutes of my life.Like this author usually and usually love the cedar cove stories.	1
12054	A2M72NEUMTFJSK	I couldn't get into it. It was too verbose and felt like I've read this same story before from this author with a few name and period changes.	1
12055	A39WNHTVRFJ46Z	Wasn't good storyline I have always enjoyed Ms. King but not this series total waste of money I don't think I will order anymore of her books.	0
12056	AW4YQ7303VT0	I only read this book because it was free. Believe me I should have gone with my gut and left it alone.	0
12057	AA5FVX2OWISH1	Unfortunately, the author has tried too hard to be funny, and so is not. The present tense narrative is awkward to read.	0
12058	A1M17SUAWG5M6T	I picked this book because of all the great reviews. But I guess its just me because this book sucked. Nothing but games.  This book had potential but failed.	1
12059	A3M5JMKPMAUDF3	A disappointing novel  from an excellent writer, extremely boring, repeated many times the same thing and it is not interesting	0
12060	AJJH71T4KKHOH	Not much to this love story. Misunderstandings are what the book revolves around. Clear that up and its happily ever after.	1
12061	A25JOQV5JVIILU	Your feeding kids bread and water, how disgusting, should be considered abuse to with hold proper nutritious foods on purpose.	0
12062	A1R80I3FS4UKPA	It seems like a lot of words for a children's book.  I couldn't keep my child interested in it because of the lack of pictures.	1
12063	A1XQH2T75QIY3M	I'm pretty sure that in this book (like the first one) there wasn't much in the way of pleasure for the woman, just pain.	0
12064	A2DW08X01IIHIO	Great stories and price is not bad at all the books are great reads and are very sweet I like getting the whole set all together	0
12065	A2JT5SG8KU05E5	What in the world was this author thinking. A book for the clothes of her vampire princess is probably the worst thing on kindle.	0
12066	A35910D7USTGL3	What a horrible way to end a book..... til short and abrupt about everything . This has better have been free or in Honda be pissed	1
12067	A1M06GHTSUNCZ1	This novella was a puff of air and it brings nothing to the table. Sex is sex without real passion. Just say &#34;no&#34;.	0
12068	A119K9E3BCHJK7	I did'nt find this book worth the money i paid for it, it was an introduction basicly when i thought that i would get a full book.	1
12069	A2T7BO8JWZT6HB	Not as good a read as other books. It reaches climax too soon and leaves the reader wanting more even though it ends.	1
12070	ASNO9Y6SQBRUT	I enjoyed very much the first book! the second book was okay it was not as good as the first one it drag on!	1
12071	AH2DRN21JUJ	Seems simply written and way too predictable. Interesting premise but no meat behind it. Maybe the second book will be better???	1
12072	A28X1LGYZ20G92	All the ingredients for a good storyline, but too underdeveloped to be successful. A little too far off to actually be believable.	1
12073	A3AMBD68PZ078P	The premise of this book was totally disgusting and I'm sorry I readit. I deleted it. Don't bother if you value your sanity.	0
12074	A27WGYA3EP0NST	One of the shallowest stories I have read in a long time. All dialog with very little around it. Nice sentiment but needs filler.	1
12075	AJ3K2B0EF1Z9B	Ok read..gives her hints how she saves money on things she buys. Nothing we haven't read before. If you can get it free..okay...but don't pay for it.	1
12076	A1Q62S1E5H3Q2A	Not the best and not the worst.  Silly at times could have drawn the story out more and it would have been better.	1
12077	ATN6JCVLU2ZQI	The actual case was interesting but the author kept repeating information over and over! Research statics about contract killers was unnecessary!  This was a long and rambling book!	1
12078	A3TYWLLZGB1EDR	This was so dull and so centered on the smut I was falling asleep during the reading.	0
12079	A2U3BMKX6B1VVT	I was expecting more. The book is a slow read. I hope this is the last book to the series.	1
12080	A3J5NLP6L37WGV	Short, choppy sentences. It flowed like the Grand Rapids on a stormy night. Very boring - glad it was a very short story. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.	0
12081	A2OJCOYLSNA8CJ	Cute read for a short story, but definitely nothing to do with BDSM. Glad I got it free. Not interesting.	0
12082	AMIWR5U8IVOB3	There's nothing earth shattering here, just ways you can get moving if you sit and think for a few minutes.	1
12083	A2EZZ9013OIVUT	The puzzles were fun but getting the answer was not easy to figure out.  There seemed to be a glitch somewhere.	0
12084	A1ZJX4ZIVCFPNY	this is going on my dnf book shelf. I can't continue reading this. I hate Catherine and all the actions that she's committing. I just can't.	0
12085	A38DIX88M5T94P	This is swat bloodlust. Guns and killing. I probably wouldn't buy anymore, unless I can't find something else to read.	1
12086	A32R29V9U32696	The book &#34;The Night Everything Changed&#34; didn't interest me much. Couldn't seem to empathize with the author and/or the characters.Sorry.	1
12087	A3LFO26FUDGCVB	While it was written pretty well it was a very depressing story.  Goldie just couldn't catch a break.  Sigh.  Not my type of story line.	1
12088	A10OBFHWCSGJA3	So sad that just as I was getting into the story and wanting more... It ended and left me wanting more.	1
12089	A2HDMNLHPU5OYB	This is not a great book and seems to go nowhere slowly.  If it's offered free, go ahead and take it, better than nothing.	1
12090	A2A3EJGONKSWP2	I did not finished even half way reading this story.It did not interest me in the least.I want a refund! won't continue on with a part 2.	1
12091	A31S0HSNNCYE6U	Saw the TV coverage and thought it may be amazing./amusing!!  Was neither. I guess it must work for someone!  It paid for a pretty nice looking house	1
12092	A2YIBWC0DHI51K	I only have it two stars because it was too short. Just when it started to get interesting it ended.	1
12093	A1RDHAIDDLBRKH	This storyline lacks depth and / or excitement.  Even the sex scenes are dull.  I kept reading, hoping it would get better - it didn't.	0
12094	A1BLVCVTR48OK	Many books claim to tell you something you did not knowalready but there is same old repeatition. Many good works exist so don't bother	1
12095	A3I1XHJFA537R4	These were ok. But not my favorite.  Very short and still didn't keep my interest. Glad they were Fred. Disappointed	1
12096	A1RTVWTWZSIC94	Did not like.  Book seems like it was written for a child.  Couldn't get into it and bored me so I had to let it go.	0
12097	A10LR5LRY9SGI2	Not what I was expecting. Turned out to be a children's book of abc a different twist. It was ok.	1
12098	A30EXJZTDRVDJR	I was hoping this book would continue on. It was way too short leaves you hanging. Would like to know what is going to happen next?	1
12099	A1E4Y7RO9DWLPH	Horrible torture porn. Passive voice abounds. Pricing is insulting. If this is a what Riptide thinks passes as quality writing, I'll pass.	0
12100	A1UF3ECLQVAUFG	Only a preview of the book. If I had know would have just gotten full book. Not sure if I would buy full book for price	0
12101	A28CHWBVU67ETH	this story had the potential to be a great book. unfortunately just as it was getting good the story ended.  it was a big disappointment	0
12102	ABG7RC2E2YODO	I did not find this interesting at all, just did not like it and I usually like all of the Western Romance books.Would not recommend.	1
12103	A35Z7E0S7R1TTP	Characters are wooden, predictable.  The story is not particularly exciting.  I'll check out other books by this author, but I'm not going to bother with the others in this trilogy.	1
12104	A2D7DS1DGAWGVR	This book was not what I expected it to be. What happened after she answered the door?? I mean really did it have to end like that....no real ending	1
12105	A17O3IALB0VVSA	The author writes very well.  The story is short but captivating.  It does seem repetitive from the first and second books, but the stories are link through the artifacts.	1
12106	AGEZJWP6KGIUU	Not my favorite book.  A waste of time to read.  Would not recommend this book to anyone.  Don't invest the time or the money.	0
12107	A2BW5NGVSE3IY9	A little disappointed. I wanted to like the story and kept hoping the story would get better but it didn't. Lame	1
12108	A32AUTWA8MM81K	So you have lost creativity or lack of emotions.  Women are women's worst enemies.  Please learn how to write about emotions and not gratuitous!	0
12109	A31OB4RY9RW6PD	I don't even know what I just read. Good thing it was free. It seems like just a bunch of words skewed together.	0
12110	A3FFFZX9SXC74S	I didn't care for all the wordiness in her writing. Things moved along way too slowly. I probably will not pick up one of her book in the future.	1
12111	A36KQKKQJRB8C7	Bad things exist in life, let's all cry.wahh ................................................. feel better? What you liked it? Oh well read this book.	0
12112	AQI033SOZZ2G6	The book was not the usual Patterson quality. I was disappointed  !  It lacked cohesion and I was not excited about reading what the last chapters would bring.	1
12113	AY43L5C0U5ESL	I was disappointed with this book. Glad that it was free. As it took quite a few chapters to get into the story. Would not recommend it.	0
12114	AIBXU0FV3YBIS	I can't bring myself to finish this book. I tried, but it is so poorly written, I cannot endure it. Save  your money and your time!	0
12115	A2DAG814I7SICP	Sorry but the main female is vacuous, the story a contrivance and I couldn't read page chapter 2 it was so dreadful.	0
12116	A5CC0IPA0GOA8	I could not finish this book as the story jumped around so much and there was very little if any character development no wonder.  Such a waste of time!!	0
12117	A3UTP9WL95S3LM	I absolutely hated the end and I will not read another book by this author. I was really disapointed and felt like I just wasted my time reading....	1
12118	AKVL9OYN9D0WA	i thought this story was SSSLLLOOOWWW! I had the hardest time getting through it. And I didnt find the characters super likable either :(	1
12119	A11ATXABJX9G79	A virgin, a wealthy Italian man, an arranged marriage.  How trite can we get?  A Harlequin romance with a little sex thrown in.	0
12120	A3HIUIVIZCE01M	The beginning is boring as hell but it gets better and makes me want to read book 2!! A book to read during free time...	1
12121	A2P3LIKG2H56VD	Started out great, then went to far out weird. Not into the whole peeing and playing with produce type of thing. Was good before that.	1
12122	A3CJ6C1LLZXVJI	This book did not offer any help beyond the basics.  It was a total waste of time and money.  I had it refunded.	0
12123	AX16V8MNHKOPH	This story is way to schmaltzy.  The premise is hardly believable.  Poor kid living with rich kid without parental oversight.  No suspense. Cute but ultimately boring.	1
12124	ARLYBWP1FSZ19	I did'nt enjoy it,  I really was a teenage book and I found it silly and boring, not my type of book	1
12125	A3DPT667EPSQ6I	pure crap	0
12126	A2FNN34IFSS5I5	It made no sence what so ever. Little bit o sex... Thats about it....lots of dirty talk and ????s??? Silly silly waste of time :(	1
12127	A2XB5B3LZ7EJF8	Just too ghetto for my tastes.  I guess I'm more into erotica that's more middle class.  The language was just too rough.	0
12128	A10CRW7XRJBJ2G	THIS IS A COME ON TO BUY THE MORE COMPLETE APP. ITS FREE SO I HAVE NO COMPLAINT WOULD NOT GET IT AGAIN	1
12129	A06975481L95HXF4UAB7A	goofy story of some badass who could turn into a werewolf to fight other werewolfs, or wolves.not much of a plot, and lost my interest half way through.	1
12130	A3TQUTZGV270Y3	A very simple how-to, not a lot of detail, just the minimal basics of meditation.  A bit religious for my tastes.	1
12131	A24MW8SSP5G2UK	This was not the book I thought it was.  It was one of the first I got after my setup with Amazon.  Just not interested.	1
12132	AQJN7J3B740RW	The werewolves thing was just thrown here.The story was more like some romance, in which the wolves were not necessary.Even will be better without them.	1
12133	A2VPW6AUH2WJTG	I didn't like it. It downloaded okay but the stories did not grab the children's attention. I deleted it from my Kindle.	1
12134	A1Q3IWKRS8VKT6	Too long and too long. Bot the kind of story for mr. Just drags on and on.Very repetitious. Wasn't worth the time	0
12135	A1AKW8WY2AP5CK	OOOOOOooooooh.. I LOVE Tara Brown but this book lacked the depth of characters that I so love in her other books, this was a complete miss for me...	1
12136	AO8F4CPNTURAD	So predictable guess I need a change sod authors these books are all the same no new plots or twist to these stories ugh. I'm done	1
12137	A2JBR7V3F6YPW9	the book is well written quite understandable and the discriptions good.  i thoujght it would be more space than ground fighting.  fighting on the ground bores me silly.	1
12138	A2OWJSM1Y9Y8OV	This Is a great read if you are fourteen years old,  no where near as sexist  early Heinlein which is a plus.  It's pulp!!!!! Yeah!!!	1
12139	A2O21FY4J1GHIV	Hard to keep track of who is who. A very busy novel with perhaps too many plots but, very good mystery.	1
12140	A1YK6K0RODFUEG	Impracticable, improbable and poorly written. Don't waste your time or money. I can't figure out how I even managed to finish it.	0
12141	A11TT460OXJPVA	This story could not keep my attention.  Boring.  Too standard a tale.  If you want to go to sleep fast, then try it.	1
12142	A10K4CN7CEA3K0	not worth it..even if it was free..it just did not make sense and I was like why and what was going on	1
12143	A3VE2TZ77K6U3X	This don't have the passion that other romance novels have. It's ok for a 99 short story. I prefer Tessa Dare books.	1
12144	A2YA001RXGQRNR	I mean really just starting this is an okay but if you know anything about fitness and nutrition this is a waste of time.	1
12145	A2THNFFFYO1A6P	I was hoping for more variety to stimulate my thoughts but didnt find it here. Just wasnt what I was needing.	1
12146	A1ISB7G90TVIOC	Not worth 99 cents.  A horribly garbled mess of a book.  I love time travel romance novels (and bought this out of desperation), but you can still save yourselves.	0
12147	A2EA1VA2L2R6WD	I return it because I reordered the next size kindle. I ordered the next size kindle so I didn't need it.	0
12148	A14G7Q1O0T1AUU	This book does nothing but repeat the highlights of this series of books and adds nothing. Boring, Boring , Boring .....	1
12149	A25X5XS14W37L0	This was written  as letters to different companies complaining about their products but the letters are pretty much from the same character that comes off as stupid or very ignorant.	0
12150	ALAQIS898Z7N	I found the language and behavior not Christ-like.  It was not uplifting and I was offended by some of it.I do not recommend it.	0
12151	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	It was not my cup of tea. There was something about it that just did not seem right. The characters were good, but they did not work well together.	1
12152	A15DOUOL03Z2S6	Jumps around with both paragraphs and sentences.  No flow at all.  Might be a great plot, but this author needs writing lessons.	0
12153	A350Y4L5YNOUDP	i did download this by mistake but it was only 99 cents so i kept it big mistake this was awful.  this was way too demeaning and unrealistic.	0
12154	ALGJUPAK5743P	You could find more by searching Google. 13 recipes for this price?????	1
12155	A3U01929F3MOR8	I could not even get past the second chapter.  I like young adult books as they by-pass all the sex scenes.  This one just didn't make sense to me.	0
12156	A1PN2BIJO6DK87	I started to read it and got rid of it. I did not care for it at all. I would not recommend it to anyone reallly.	0
12157	A3UUN5NEZME5NV	Very boring book. Tried to read to the end but couldn't do it. I failed to see the purpose of the story.	1
12158	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	Boring book and did not hold my attention in the least.  Don't waste your hard earned money! Saw nothing funny!	0
12159	A33H2FIN6KTV1T	Hard to believe that an accountant is trying to be a PI and a bad boy disc jockey really wants to be a concert pianist,  Keft ne cikd,	0
12160	A2MQNZNT2ZK6P7	this was not what i expected.  It was fine, however, short, too short..I thought it would be a story line incorporated, at least.	1
12161	A2CO15H66J3SGI	What a joke!  Complete waste of time downloading this and  reading it.  Never finished it. Ended up deleting it.  Crap	0
12162	AAQ573CXKUIMG	Not very romantic, and not very steamy, with the distracting element of one of the characters being psychic.  Very little actually happens.	1
12163	A3SSZ04GW68ZI2	Never read this book ,it got deleted from my library by accident I will get it again sometime to read it	0
12164	A3JKKOMN8EDY2O	Never finished it. Very confusing - didn't seem to make any sense and I didn't like it. Guess I should have read the intro better.	0
12165	A32AUTWA8MM81K	Not clean.  Well written. But problems with the characters.  The mystery was interesting .....  Did not enjoy this book at all.	0
12166	AAO0FHX90Y80A	I found the advice in here so basic, I could have written it before I had a child of my own.  No tips or secrets here.	1
12167	A2XXJMO27FCM8B	Nah...sorry I started reading it. Underwritten and not worth the download time.  Sick of downloading books that at  not finished.	0
12168	AUJOSPDFK5OTR	This book might be beneficial for a young person but most of what is told in this book is common knowledge.	1
12169	APX2YKOFIYYRI	Not a bad story, cute, written well..felt a little too cute for my taste..a little blah but for many I'm sure they will enjoy it..	1
12170	AYB90RJXY32BI	Not too into it too hardcore for me. Didn't like the male character. But loved the ending where it was only a dream.	1
12171	A3180QQTFVB2R4	Just not well done.  Boring.  I have read books on the Borgia Family which were great--but not this one.Don't waste your $$ and time as well.	0
12172	A3HEG0QCOK446R	Eh.  Kinda strange and its part of a continuation series kind of thing.  Wasn't my thing.	1
12173	AA4CPJJWT0PJY	Was too short, not helpful enough for those of us needing to make choices with a fixed income in today's society.	0
12174	A34337EMJYTNEV	This is a cute short story of a young woman's self exploration.  It's an ok read that gets a little old after awhile.	1
12175	A377OHO2E1V54Q	"I did not enjoy this series very much. Micah was not much of a ""hero"" I kept reading hoping he would redeem himself but it never happened."	1
12176	AWZ60T8B0ITAP	Not sure what to think of this short...wasn't sure what it was to be.  I guess it was a surprise ending.	1
12177	AER40M9KWTWMX	A complete bore.  Waste of 10 minutes.  At least it wasn't full of grammatical errors-hence two stars instead of one.  Writing 101 teaches SHOW don't TELL.	1
12178	A1UO24TQN0G1MP	It was ok but not enough story line it seemed to be lacking in something. Just needed s little bit more	1
12179	AER1LWT762JBH	I would not recommend this book.  It was slow and the story was very light.  I would not recommend this author	0
12180	A65N2PTRLG5W9	I liked this book, but found it to be confusing at times a little hard to keep interested. Give it a try it's not bad	1
12181	A1FSR426FVMQJI	The main character is one stupid woman. It was like watching a train wreck. Reminded me of how much I want to smack Scarlett O'Hara. This character. . .O my.	1
12182	AN0EV6VUCPGWH	The book was short. Read it in a few hours. Not much of a storyline or character development. Would have liked for there to be more to read	1
12183	A25MKXX259QN2E	FROM THE TITLE I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GOING TO BE A HEAT.. NOT. IT WAS A VERY SLOW READ. HAD TO SKIP A FEW PAGES. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.	1
12184	A2DT6NVG11IEN4	This book is average. I really did not enjoyed the ending. I wanted to know more about the character Malkiah and I did not get that.	1
12185	A3BBM4UHPXVJS9	I started this book, and it was so pedestrian and uninteresting, I returned it. All exposition and no character or plot makes for a dull read.	0
12186	A1GQ05M3D2DHV4	short story porn, very boring, same old stories of women secretly yearning to be dominated by men, or animals, depending on how you view it	0
12187	A18K4TMJWIZ9IB	This book was crazy as crazy get. I sure hope there is not a part 2 to this book. Wish I could give it no stars	1
12188	A2U6W05N24JDB7	I was not impressed withThis short story.unexpectedI was disappointed with this short story.  Maybe because of the editing,  I just felt let down at the conclusion.	1
12189	A3JCDW56L0OS5K	This was a DNF for me. I found the laguage stiff & unrealistic. I'll wait for Cherise Sinclaire's next offering. Based on this I'm  not a fan of Ms. Bradford.	0
12190	A31MLLDYP9VQ7D	I know its a short and sweet story but it seemed a bit far fetched. Very descriptive though but not my cup of tea.	1
12191	A3W0ZMGHM3T2M8	There are only 15 recipes in this book so the price is right (free).  Many use cake mixes and Stevia sweetener.  There are no recipes that appealed to me.	1
12192	A27V6NFIQ8XFBW	I have read 15% before I gave up. I just can't get into it. I'm not going to read anymore of this series.	0

12195	A1BKFUHW60UWEL	If you are looking for a Fifty Shades look alike..  keep moving.  I cant remember anything about the book other than the garage scene.	1
12196	A2O1H3S7AQ21HC	The book was so rushed...really bad editing...and not good love scenes...I like the hero though...Noah was pretty sweet and he really loved Jules	0
12197	A1CJ0ONQM0WALG	I  lost from the begin to the end. I would not reccommend this book to anyone at this time. I feel that I am missing something in the story.	1
12198	A2Z542ULUO8PNL	This book was not up to the standards I have come to expect from Louise Penny.  It isn't worth reading.	1
12199	A3GN4RSIFV6O20	Not much information that I didn't already know.  It was so short I wonder if the book was completely downloaded.	1
12200	A30411QNHGSW5Y	This book was choppy, and the male lead was... I don't know, like a monosyllabic Neanderthal.  You'd think that would be sexy, but you'd be wrong.	1
12201	A32PYP772QZE4T	From Darkness Comes: The Horror Box Set (8 Book Collection) contains this book, with 7 other books as well, for only 99. Caveat Emptor!	0
12202	A355P0CUM6MXOT	I wish the brief review had advised that this was not a complete story - or somehow I missed the fact.  Very disappointing	1
12203	A1LH7RNJDSNCUD	A cozy little mystery that was, frankly, a little too cheesy for me.  The characters were very, in my opinion, slow.  The story was slow. Could not finish it.  Sorry.	1
12204	A18WP5PU1HFNCX	At first, this book kept me entertained and intrigued. Eventually, I was exasperated with how long it took the characters to resolve their issues.	1
12205	AFITCO8MIFCHV	I thought this book who be a fun romantic book.  Instead it is a constant downer.  Every bad thing that can happen to a girl	0
12206	AV7RTRG1RC05E	I found this confusing and too vague. Story started out interesting but quickly became not boring but less captivating. I liked the promise of what it could be though.	0
12207	A2Z51TT2NDJZ8R	I think that you need to read other books first this is not so good as a stand alone book.	1
12208	A30411QNHGSW5Y	The synopsis said that this book would make me believe in love again. No, no it did not! This book was just a big NOPE to me.	0
12209	A1KVDCIGCBNFXC	Predictable and stupid. Certainly not hot enough to have wasted the time reading. Sorry but it really was very stupid.	0
12210	AYTQAMRPXHTA8	No valuable storyline. Needed to develop the story more, especially with Michael and Ryan facing real issues. Very flat and boring	0
12211	A3DGMXQVIT6R31	I read this book for about 30 mins and I had to quit is was just so bad.  I'm sure somebody likes it but it just was not for me.	1
12212	AF1D3SZPJNWR6	Could not get into this story and finally gave up after reading for three days and still did not know where the story was going.	0
12213	A10Z1GSQWC664Y	I am not finished with this book. It does not hold my interest. The story line so far is like a bad movie.	1
12214	A3LMQFDRF72E1U	Ummm....glad it was FREE! Won't be reading any more of this series if it continues like this. The concept makes no real sense.	1
12215	A10C3068FTNIOC	It was an okay read.  I guess I'm just not into that era right now. It was very slow going and predictable.  Even the sex was predictable.	1
12216	A1EQPK52LQHPQG	It felt like the story line hopped around with storyline inconsistencies . The only way I would read book two is if its cheap.	1
12217	A2CJ68SDUY3OPH	TO MUCH $$ FOR 59 PGS RICH GIRL GOT FRAMED SENT TO ANOTHER PLANET HAS A SEND OFF FROM STEP-MOM44	1
12218	A30MUZK4VLV1KY	This was so short, I felt like I finished it before I started!  I have read many Johansen books and I have enjoyed them all.....until now.	1
12219	A3MHJBXFJX6DU7	This was too short of a story for the real horror to have the shock effect that it deserved! Would make a great story if it had been longer.	1
12220	AS04EGZ63DVGZ	I love mysteries but I just couldn't get into this. That doesn't make it bad. It's just not my cup of tea. Obviously there are many Sherlock Holmes fans.	1
12221	A3I125PAG9EBYR	I went with the reviews and was looking forward to reading this book.  I struggled through the firsthalf and just couldn't go any farther.	0
12222	A3HI88NDBO7WFK	A lot of the recipes consisted of ingredients I have never heard of before and wouldn't be able to locate in a grocery store. It just wasn't for me.	1
12223	A1YRHW997OD5Q8	I don't like giving bad reviews but this book I didn't give a fair go really. So, really, I can't say much about it.	0
12224	A1BUYA5QHUYT0K	Didn't use after getting the app.	0
12225	A2GN3H3YY0XRZL	I love the plum books but didn't care for this one-I will be happy when janet writes another S. Plum book-	1
12226	A21QHN7DP24E1P	i did not pay attention to the cover of the book, only the title and thought this was the Giving Tree by Shell Silverstein.	1
12227	A3VKF16GL07S64	It was what I would call a desperate read. I didn't care for the characters in the least and that made for a poor read.	1
12228	ABEK1Q70KABM3	This book was ok..not great or something I would recommend. I was expecting this book to have the same passion and romance like the Fixed Trilogy but it did not.	1
12229	A21AUK3OY0RSYX	A good reference book but no story.  I didn't  find it useful.  It's probably good for someone who want to try the lifestyle.	1
12230	A24ZGALKRTN4FF	I just don't get what the author was trying to do here. Whatever it was, it wasn't done very well, and it was basically pornogaphic.	0
12231	A3MWO5XHX8K2U4	Over before it started with characters only a mother could love.  The premise could have been something but failed to deliver.	1
12232	A1CXB55CJYIK9V	"I received an email that this book was offered free for today only to find out it is offered to ""Prime"" customers only~huge disappointment and not good advertising."	0
12233	A1W4F5GXHYAX9G	Amateurish, formulaic, generic teenage vampire romance crud. Seriously people, if you're a fan of the genre, there are better examples out there.	1
12234	A133SY59R19Y5P	So frustrated. A real Lennox fan but can't read this book due to edits all the way through.  So off putting	0
12235	ALRTPXOFE85N4	This book reminded of a satire and not my favorite type of reading.  The main characters were colorful and unusual but still not enough to hold my interest.	1
12236	AX3W2FJYMPWZQ	I liked the ending especially. The only reason I rated these books so low is because I won't reread them. They are good though.	1
12237	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This story was not my cup of tea. It was hard to follow the plotI could not read anyone after a few chapters.	1
12238	A1U7ZTYL9Q2CLS	I was unimpressed with this seemingly pointless story of tragedy in Haiti. I kept waiting for a moment of truth that never happened. Anticlimactic at best.	1
12239	A3IC05KV0TWHEE	Its OK book. some of the patterns are too simple and kind of dowdy. Good for a beginning sewer or a busy mom.	1
12240	A2KT57BI8BNQFQ	MORE OF THE SAME STORIES TOLD BEFORE. NOW THEY ARE RESUMED AND A SHORT STORY IS INCLUDED. FRUSTRATED TO HAVING PAYED FOR AN INCONCLUSIVE STORY.	1

12244	APVZYNOME3CLV	You can not accesses scripture quickly.  cj	0
12245	A2ZLG900CVX45Q	Its ok for a freebie.  And also for a very quick read.  Just something to fill time if waiting for an appointment.	1
12246	A3VE7N2XUI8C3K	Could have been a good book but it missed the mark.  Too much silliness.  Couldn't finish the book.  Just plain, silly, childless stuff.	1
12247	A3AQKF73Y2VWTL	This book was very boring. I skipped many pages and  didn't miss a thing. It just never took off and seemed to drag.	1
12248	A1H5NYXQBEUAX8	This story was ok at best.  I normally love Rachel's stuff but this book did nothing for me.  Honestly I hate I wasted money on it. :(	1
12249	AVY3CK2LZDLC4	not a good story.  it was short...did not develop.  i wish it was a better storyline. i wish it was longer.	0

12251	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	I read this in one sitting. Not a bad book for free. If you have to pay thou, move along.	1
12252	A15NCK12RT90I6	I skipped over half of it, asked for a refund! Couldn't get into the story. It just wasn't for me.	1
12253	A3LCGPTY694NX	I thought it was confusing how the story was put together,the  ending was in the beginning,it was ok for a short story.	1
12254	A20MLP027RDS1T	days of the rogue, had very little rogue in it expecte more on damien in this book,but not so much.otherwise good book in a nicky charles way,more editing needed	1
12255	A1E6B3YJVUZ1UA	I TRIED TO GET INTO THIS STORY BUT THERE WERE TOO MANY CHARACTERS.  SOUNDED SILLY SO I DIDN'T READ VERY MUCH BEFORE DELEATING.	1
12256	A1X7NJIT4ES1CI	Its target was for a younger audience then me. The ending was confusing. No resolution. It. was really  a disappointment.	1
12257	A22SPZZM9EX8BO	Nor for me.  This was not what I expected.  And I did not really enjoy it.  If you are into this type of book ...	0
12258	A3V3OE9BRKSE35	If it takes more than 3 chapters to make any sense, why waste my time with the rest?  No more from her.	1
12259	A1B9RZB9R60XTN	Offensive and insulting to Christians but non Christians will not know that they are being deceived by the author's warped theology.	0
12260	A1VA2I63CK09BU	This was really hard to get through. I was bored with the story, the sex was dull and I just couldn't find anything good about it.	0
12261	AGHVE1B5TWJ5U	So over this series.  I loved the first 5 -6 and then they just got boring.  Glad it was free.  I didn't believe anything about this one.  Sorry Kat.	1

12264	A3P44N4J5KBL8D	This book was very poorly written and no turn of events, same story you knew what was next. I barely finished reading it, just was NOT impressed at all.	1
12265	A14VDCBLFS3RGG	Probably one of the weirdest novellas I have ever read. But a bad story, just quite different. Fantasy and real worlds collide. Not bad but not what I would choose.	1
12266	A3LX7V74JG4HV3	Waste of time. I barely read half of the book wasn't interesting at all. Not worth it in the end...	0
12267	A27UUUKYBTJTJ8	Just could not get into this one. Was cliche after cliche for the genre. Sorry to give such a low rating Sean but don't quit trying.	1
12268	A38UCV1LPMCJOP	It was an interesting story, but not too in-depth, and the plot was a little simple. Not to mention all of the cursing.	1
12269	A2OTF5FOCCYWGE	this was just boring no point no plot i read it because i bought it thats bout it... wont be buying part 2	0
12270	A17UQL76OCVR4F	Was definitely disappointed. Glad I had not paid for it. Save your time and keep looking! Would not recommend this book.	1
12271	A3K74W62348SOQ	the first 30% was okay at like 35% it got random at 50% i gave up and quit reading it i dont want to read book 2	1
12272	A3MNSB7UM77KYO	I wanted to like this book but simply couldn't after reading halfway through I have up.  It's me, I'm sure.  Try it for yourself.	1
12273	A2XX3ADI3QA845	My full review is on Lurid-lit.com. I normally enjoy Mr. Brennan and this publishers' work. This just didn't catch me.	1
12274	AWGSJH8JYT8XP	Sorry, this just didn't hold my interest at all, barely got thru fourth chapter.  Not what I expected.  Very boring.	1
12275	A1MMSCIJG03YTL	Literally nothing I didn't already know here. Free, thank goodness. If I had bought it I would be very unhappy.	0
12276	APH9VV43NMJSG	This story was not very interesting. I wish the author would have made this story more interesting. I don't think I'll read any more of this author's work.	1
12277	A8P8OL25VJS8Z	Started off promising,  but definitely too many tragic turns.  Best, were comedic moments.  Seemed like several books squeezed into one.	1
12278	AQIFM7X1KQ891	Really did not care for the book.  No plot.  Really not into voyeuristic stories.  Might be good reading for others but just not my thing.	1
12279	A3LDFZW9TAJRRE	I did not like this book, why would you write a book that someone would have to read two other books to finish.	0
12280	ABWDR8C74FY53	Definitely not your typical king short story....good in the middle but the ending was a big let down.  Could've Been so much better!  It was just OK.	0
12281	AL373I3DCU7R3	I'm not even sure what this was, it's not a short story and it's not a chapter. I'm a huge fan of Vicki Lewis Thompson, however this was a mistake.	1
12282	AFOBKJ9G6NVMG	This wasn't a book, only a teaser so other books will be sold from the three pages that was advertised as a book.	0
12283	A1IO64VZRGWRUI	I gave it this rating because I didn't like it, I do not like kindle books, and I'm getting really tired of required reviews.	0
12284	A26F5B12T242LL	Poorly written romances that just didn't hold my interest. The quality was about what you would expect for less than 20 cents per book	1
12285	A10QB8RAEYKYL0	This is a VERY short story with little plot or character development.  Same those few minutes it takes to read the entire story and purchase something you can enjoy.	0
12286	A1ADDVF96U9WPS	After reading the entire Cedar Cove series, I found this to be dull and not up to the standard of her books.	1
12287	A3L25J49I9SAFL	Story was too short for my money. Nothing but lowlife killing laymen and taking money that is not their s	1
12288	A22WX922BQ5SFE	It was too short for me. I thought that it could have been a good book if it was for older kids.-Anonymous	1
12289	A18LHLOK3OZN3W	I didn't even make it half way thru this book.  It was utter garbage with boring characters and not much plot to speak of.	0
12290	A2O4TTVDSVHFOG	A lot of people loved it, but not me.Puppy in shelter gets adopted by nice familyNice family has babyPuppy goes to bridge.THE ENDNothing special here	1
12291	A5BN0484ZBIQ	Too much violence for my taste.  I couldn't relate to any of the main characters.  I did finish the book, but won't be ordering any sequels.	1
12292	A7W1T9CXHUCM	I must have read it because it says so on my reader, but I can't for the life of me say what it is about. A forgettable experience, I guess.	1
12293	A32FE3ZR0UYY4C	Why in the world did I download this weird little short story? Don't do it! Buy a real book, instead!	0
12294	A17IEXRKHGU0CZ	Therefore I can't really enjoy this book. I'm under the impression that all the characters were less interesting than in the first book, even Lacey. But maybe it's just me.	1
12295	A129OQZEZVUGP0	I did not think to much of this book. Was not at all what i had thought it would be.	1
12296	A32Y9GPVCX16X6	I thought this was  discusted book. If you like reading this type u would enjoy it. I download by accident and I deleted right away.	0
12297	A2076BGSWD0A7K	I wanted to like the book but I really disliked the wife almost from the beginning. There was not enough interaction or action to keep me interested.	1
12298	AWY82ON1P201E	I Think That This Book Is A Tease. It Was Good But, Why The Sudden Ending ? Kind Of Disappointed In It.	0
12299	A2I1FYC058CCN0	Felt like this book is for a very young child. Didn't enjoy the story line or the author's writing style.	1
12300	A274ID5CYHO2TW	I was simply annoyed with the whole book, it seemed rather silly and i like silly books usually, i've already deleted it from my kindle.	1
12301	A18KAG3L1GRDLK	Thank God it only took a whole five mins to read. Cute but lacking everything. Wouldn't want to waste another five minutes.	1
12302	AO9BD8E5ORA3H	It felt a little rush..,.never really got a chance to like either character.  The sex scene was ok it should have been intense	1
12303	AI6H3U5DI6PWM	lame, lame, lame. Pathetic jokes. Don't even know how to stretch this review to meet the minimum word requirement. LAME	0
12304	A3N0SASEV6C0WX	Disappointed read prequel but when I tried to read relentless it is just an excerpt for a different book. Talk about a waste. Extremely unhappy.	0
12305	AM2AHOJ8NAA6G	I did not read it.not because it was boring but I went off the idea of cider vinegar..so I cannot say	0
12306	A1YE1PZH1FH0W0	I didn't like it at all short read. Not really conclusion. Made absolutely zero sense. Pure waste of my time.	0
12307	A2Y9A8RR4CAQIX	I didn't like it enough to even finish reading it. Sometimes happens when you try a new author. Sorry, author.	0
12308	A1DBCUSELB970S	Was a bit too 'graphic' for me. I prefer less 'sex' and didn't realize this was going to be 'spicy'.  Not my cup of tea.	1
12309	A2RAC8FJ425TA3	It was okay...I wish there was more interaction emotionally with sir. It would have added to the anticipation of reading the next book	1
12310	A1SVU4OM6EL935	Bluegrass Undercover was okay for a free book, but I would not recommend paying for it. The storying line was too simplistic and predictable.	1
12311	A2D6B2K8CM1FHG	Was very disappointed with this so called book.  No story, no plot and no ending.  Will not read anymore of his work.	0
12312	A1GP9MIP2DMQI8	the story is too short and too fast. I think this would be good if the story is longer so we would know the character more.	0
12313	A3P6AZZN8T8LX8	This series was all over the place and nothing good came of it. I was so invested in something good happening for her but it never did	1
12314	A340O7ZW66DPPS	I downloaded this because it was free on the Kindle that day. The only useful thing about it was that it was entertaining to see how they used duct tape.	1
12315	A2JU7J21AQJIEP	I thought the premise was good, but the execution fell short...rambled on, too many characters that were not relevant to the story.	1
12316	A3NE4BLLZXLPYE	"I gave it a 2 star rating not enough action, let"" see how the next book will be can't wait for it."	1
12317	A3VA1YBCTZ887Z	I didn't really care for.Eva the story was good.at first and an interesting plot but it seemed rushed. It's not a bad story just not for me.	0
12318	A3A7FF87LEVCQ1	This story isn't badly written and it flows well (if predictably) to the end, where the entire story collapses under the weight of a ridiculous and completely unlikely twist ending.	1
12319	A2HPRW905YE6GF	Storyline was too fat fetched, Not real and the way it was written was dull.I would not recommend this to anyone	0
12320	AP33SX42AARYK	Story seems like it skips a lot when it jumps to another chapter,very disappointed cause I thought it was the whole story and not just a tease.	1
12321	A280EBTOBXQAUQ	Don't bother downloading this book!  The tips are to either don't pay your bills to go into default or put all your purchases on credit cards. Not helpful at all.	0
12322	A6D9XJYT5LHJ	This novel to me was boring I couldn't really get into it. I didn't care much for any of the characters.	0
12323	A1DHNXGHDH9OST	I have read many many of Gemma Halliday's books. This was definitely the worst. I actually really like her others. I was very disappointed and ended up not even finishing.	0
12324	ANYO3SVKSS2HE	recipes were &#34;dull&#34; and too normal for my taste. Used boxed products, dairy and was not within my life style.	1
12325	ALEMUAE18UFJ2	I could not finish this book, it was boring and too much describing of everything that could be left to the reader's imagination. Very immature, not my taste.	1
12326	ARGA4NOCU2YGP	Thought I was reading one of those stories in penthouse.  Not because of the content but I've read periodicals in smut magazines longer than this...geez glad it was free.	1
12327	A1QS3RS34AAEOU	I found this book to be a total let down.  I am so glad it was free and I lost no monies on this read.  Brillant, I don't think so.	0
12328	A3CUWRVAKGEFHL	This book is merely an outline of hoarding and does not in its short form have any real depth to it.	1
12329	A1YVLVFZW880Z8	God awful book.  Just terrible.  Don't even bother to get a preview of this thing, and that is free.  A completely ridiculous story, even for a zombie book.	0
12330	ATKUN8U38LMGM	Can I get a refund? Seriously will amazon give me a refund?  The whole thing was awful, the writing was terrible; ugh!	0
12331	A2N7Q95A4IE6AC	I really don't have much to say other than that this series is predictable. One thing I found unnerving was that all the characters displayed the same brand of sarcasm.	1
12332	A1PZ2GNF0MQWAO	Book was not well written.  Shallow characters, not developed.  Couldn't get past the first few characters.  I tried, but no go.	0
12333	A3UO90FEXQNHRD	I really did not enjoy this book. I was not able to finish reading it as it did not keep my attention.	1
12334	A3435ZBCT588IY	This doesn't charge very well at all, I have to wiggle it to get it to charge, very inconvenient, very disappointing :(	0
12335	A1CCLFNGJNAKL2	Interesting concept,but not what I was expecting. I didn't read the reviews before reading this and wish I had. Not the light summer book I was hoping for.	1
12336	A38N0E300Y3IT6	As a gigging musician, this was hard to read. Completely nonsensical. I wanted to like it but it's really pretty silly. Sorry.	1
12337	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	This book is boring.  Did not hold my attention in the least, and finally just quit reading it! Why waste your time and money!	0
12338	A1SITVBOE1KA2E	Lots of reading not so many recepies. Typical stuff.it was free, I would have been unhappy if I had paid even 99 cent s.just ok even if free.	1
12339	A5RH6APD8MYKQ	Would not recommend to read. What keeps u reading is that you wish to know if he ever gets back.	1
12340	AY8KFCSYHPYWZ	It all is interesting reading.  However, it goes in to much detail of every aspect and isn't recommended for anyone who just wants to resourcing curriosity	0
12341	A3U3DICM8NYHU2	I swear I have read some bad books in my life but this was really bad. How convenient the girl was psychic to help this dead story move on....horrible read...	0
12342	ASNO9Y6SQBRUT	I didn't like this book at all didn't get past chapter 6 so boring just long a drawn out no good parts at all :((	0
12343	A3JY1NIHVYX8A9	It was good but it was too long and drown out.  I am excited for the next book because of the end of this book.	1
12344	A30CP62QUWE4VF	Very short read wasn't worthy of my time. Wish I could get back the fifteen minutes i spent reading this book.	0
12345	AK0GBIVXQC6PW	I kept wondering why I kept reading it--guess I hoped for some development which didn't happen.  Very lightweight and I wasn't impressed.	1
12346	A39WNHTVRFJ46Z	I thought a was ordering a novel this series of books were much to short and not even a good storyline.	0
12347	AXO9L6OMF7P42	not that good a book; Lisa Mondello can do much better than this.  I was very disappointed in this book.	0
12348	A2KHRTGD54ZY68	I have absolutely loved Baldacci's stories in the past.  I was shocked to be unhappy with this one.  Maybe because it was a short story.	1
12349	A15ZNIADJJG9V1	Not so good. There are many books out there that are a much better to read.  I'd save your money.	0
12350	A2NMP9N41VU6OV	This is one that can be skipped.  I didn't find a strong plot or well developed characters here.  As a result I didn't even finish it.	0
12351	AO8F4CPNTURAD	This book was so slow in the beginning towards the end it felt rushed I was not happy at all so not worth it.	1
12352	A1GEIPO2O5CS18	most of the book is the author explaining how he got each story ad they stories suck. don't waste your money	0
12353	ATO5G6JDKAK1L	The intro was good and hooked you in but it was too short and frustrating as a result, I would try the author again.	0
12354	A2WA96SG30ZH5Q	I suppose I didn't read the description well enough.  It was not a story, but more about dealing in antiques.  Anyway, I didn't finish the book.	1
12355	A2W7ODM1F5U3P8	I thought I was going to get the really nitty-gritty of the undertaker's view- like an episode of Dr. G Medic al Examiner, but alas, it was pretty tame.	1
12356	A3A2RZ90XJC04L	just not my thing.  it quickly degenerated into today's slide into slime.  It is a pity, he used to tell a good tale	0
12357	A3SXUEF05I5W06	Did not like this book as much as I thought I would. The characters were boring to me and I had trouble finishing it.	1
12358	A1SERMB4JPASY3	Didn't care for the plot - characters were o.k. - sorry, just disappointed.  Will again try a William F. Brown book later on.	1
12359	A31PBCSHZO8PM9	Really boring and felt like a first book by a very inexperienced writer. I read it all to be fair.	0
12360	A1K0WHE00KFTCF	Your books are way too short for the money....just when I'm getting into the book....it's over.  Too bad. It starts intetesting	1
12361	A1H4TU6SM9TVJR	The plot was good, but characters not so good. This book was not a page turner...but at the same time would recommend for bored readers.	1
12362	AQCG4DCFJ8YWH	This was okay but needed more to it. I guess it was a let down for me I like a book with more o.f a story to it	1
12363	A1YPIP38H0QHNA	But I really hate when the end just leaves you hanging . To many unanswered question. Not many books get deleted. This one will.	1
12364	A2WNWGTZ2P0T4N	Definitely not worth purchasing. The story line was absolutely ridiculous.  A waste of time and thought. I can't believe someone actually published this. Disappointed.	0
12365	A1DKSI6V4ZSA03	I could not get into the fast one book start off kind of weird so i removed both books. Sorry Richard	0
12366	A1IGW7DRVIW4R5	Eh. It was a good story line just not very well written. Could use some editing also. But over all had a good story behind it. I guess.	0
12367	A1MPADYG3TN0VI	Didn't like this much. Didn't leave much of an impression other than I felt a bit ripped off given the price.	1
12368	A3VSHXUY4O0HS9	Oh dear this book was so totally gross I cannot believe she let a dog have sex with her that is gross.	0
12369	AXH7NGCC36XIR	The author is a good storyteller, but does have some proofreading issues.  I found the errors distracting while reading the story.	1
12370	A21MEENR3PN7DR	I hate these when they put together teasers. It is just my opinion, but to me they are a waste of my time.I should have read the details closer	0
12371	A2XJN58PA73Y7Z	Gross recipes. Does not sound appetizing. Glad the book was free and it has been removed from Kindle. Nothing else to say.	0

12374	AEXG8ERSP4QKQ	Found it long and drawn out, not believable, I could not finish reading this book.  Perhaps another time.  Just did not hold my interest.	0
12375	A3J8KF4WZ4YJL3	I couldn't get through more than a few chapters of this book. It was trite and awkward and unenjoyable. Yuck.	0
12376	AFKRKAZ0DRGI1	Boring, slow, uneventful. I normally read books more than once, but this was a yawn packed novel. Sorry Mr. Peter's.	0
12377	AY7JWB6MCA2R5	This is your run of the mill romance novel, nothing great on the characters or writting.. didnt finish even the first one.	1
12378	A1QJ17BR5K3C8K	This book was too short and it lacked substance I like reading Tymber's books I just didn't like this one as well as the others.	1
12379	A7KRTCFJ48M03	This was a so so book. Not to exciting but a good read. Don't like the way it ended left you wondering.	1
12380	A1G6J2T87JFO6S	None of it makes any sense; sorry I wasted my money; now if I can only figure out how to delete it from my Kindle!	0
12381	A3N6V3L1XFOB6B	Like all the others who were duped, I should have known, there's no free lunch. Cheap shot St. Martin's press for B Delinsky.	0
12382	A1I2UVHIA1C27P	This is not a usual combination for a romance tale.  It touched the heart strings, over simplistic but a nice read all the same.	1
12383	A10FZCFP3GGUP2	I found this story very boring and a bit disjointed .. I was really disappointed, and felt like I had wasted my time and money.	0
12384	ANYU973JNJ67T	Took way to long to get going and when it finally got there, it was nothing new to the genre.	0
12385	A2QU0L4Q1KNKJ0	I got all set to read this book because I love books about Alaska. But I could not get into it so about 50 pages into it i deleted it.	0
12386	AAQILEN2FNL1I	Just OK - not a whole lot of substance. There are predictable characters, with a predictable outcome. It's just OK, for me.	1
12387	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	I am an avid book worm, but this book did not hold my attention. Way too boring.Total waste of money.	0
12388	A3O23ZSEZH588R	I hate to give up on a book, so I muddled through this one. Mildly interesting at first but then became repetitive.	0
12389	A2VFGP7PS5OVA1	if you enjoy indie authors then I would still pass on this book.  not well written and the view of war and world building were sub par.	1
12390	A30HX9CFUECYL2	WoW this was bad bad bad! it was Short Short Short! And its was over! Thank You it WAS FREE	0
12391	A2TZDW14PLBJ4T	no plot no character just a free excuse for a couple of badly written smut scenes. not worth the time to read it	0
12392	A3E8YLPYJZ4BIH	Not scary, same plot different story.  Had everything figured out quite early on in the book.  Just really didn't like it.	1
12393	A1BISS1TN5265G	I very seldom ever do not like a book. This has got to be the most boring book I have ever read.  I am glad I got it free.	0
12394	A2KOHFCY43BX98	again not my kind of book....  pure mysteries and murders for me...the sick and lame and bad meds stories just aren't for me	1
12395	A2V2JUW211J82Z	I expected more of a story to these tales.  These were more like people sitting around telling a paragraph about their animal.	1
12396	A7CKFTC32FGC4	Not impressed by this book. I just think it could have been better. Different strokes for different folks I guess	0
12397	A2UQ2UHZIIK4D7	Was to short! !!!if its a book it should be a full book that way we can give a proper feed back	0
12398	A1SJXH39NTJW1U	It is just too short and you have to buy basically each chapter separately, I would much rather buy a 3 dollar book than do it like this.	1
12399	A1Z61I0NG6SITA	Awful. If I could give it a lesser rating, I would. Definitely shallow. No depth within the story. In one word, Macabre!	0
12400	A3LKJ5P60UPB63	If you want page after page of  clothes closet contents, and fairy headed females fine. If not do not bother with this book.	1
12401	A3AYKQTM1D7L4X	It's a nice pattern which I may do in time it has a lot of parts and I can't start it at the moment.	0
12402	A22SGQWA1VMIA6	did not like this one. a true story and one i didnt need to hear. just wasnt my type and i normally read stories like these.	1
12403	A187AV2P1G7QVF	Poorly written.  Good story.  Needs editor.  Rambles.  I would avoid the work--but give the author another chance should he try again.	0
12404	A2B9C3FMYW18UN	These short stories were good.  The characters were good and the story line was good. I couldn't put this book down until I finished it.	1
12405	A32X7B059IILCS	"Not sure why I read this short story. Not my scene, so I didn't enjoy it. Not a good advertisement for Graham's full novel ""Beyond Justice"" which I did enjoy."	1
12406	A25F0JJMZSUXFT	Faricy's other books are for the most part entertaining, but this is just disgusting. I bought it based on his others and regret I spent my 99 cents.	0
12407	A1U8PC13TJPLFT	This book was boring and very confusing, I read to relax at night but this kept my mind working as to what was going on.I didn't even finish it.	1
12408	A367NFQC0Y3G42	This was not what I was looking for in a game.  I did not like the game and I would not recommend it	0
12409	ASNL5H3QXX7JH	The build-up with character-descriptions goes on forever in the first part of the book. The climax is somewhat dull - it doesn't really get scary. Wouldn't recommend it.	1
12410	A30PSY3CKWURIS	I expected this to be longer. You start reading it and then it's over. Maybe her next one will be better.	1
12411	AQ7WEGRA67FK7	I am a steadfast Agatha Christie reader and this was probably the most disappointing book of hers that I have read.	1
12412	AULQC8ZOD5LCR	I just could not get into this book. The premise is shaky, and the charachters seemed forced. If you have other books to read, read them!	0
12413	A3QFS5Z9L0C08P	Loved it, truly hope there is a part four. This Author is talented I look forward to reading more of his work.	1
12414	A18V52M2SGMKXE	Glad this book was free, I read several chapters but just could not get into it.  I cannot understand anyone comparing it to John Grisham's books.  Don't waste your time.	0
12415	A27BDRVSB63ZH	Was the wrong size for the Kindle I have.  It was a nice design and was shipped fine and dandy, but I couldn't use it.	0
12416	A1GPJYW73DG3G1	I couldn't finish reading it. I think C Sc Colerain is a very disturbed person!  It was really way less than one star!  I hope the author gets some counseling.	0
12417	A35BMVN3ZYKGL	There was really no resolution to the beginning ... which I thought might be the plot ... then with a twist that had no middle or ending. Very disappointed.	0
12418	A25CP6UY1I2W5X	Too vague.  Could not get into understanding characters before they were in bed together.  Needed more of a story line before meeting, to me.	1
12419	A3LXFJGL0TYYW4	Really not worth the read. Boring and not well written, I would suggest finding another story to read as I gave up after the first 5 chapters.	0
12420	A9TJDMW692OCU	I hate that, 48% of an unremarkable book and then  the first few chapters of another one. I feel cheated and won t buy her books again	0
12421	A1H64H6SYNO3Y0	I thought this would give us a quick glimpce and update on the brothers; however, it seemed to jump around and not really give much insight.  I was disappointed.	1
12422	A2FV518RI34QIT	I skimmed over most of the book to get the jest of it.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.	0
12423	A28UOGAHKSLU79	no story line just crude and dirty. Insulting to the readers intelligence no imagination just base, I didn't bother to finish	0
12424	A20BHVD6ARRIC	sorry. didnt like it at all . just couldnt hold my interest.just wasnt what i expected. no interest in this	0
12425	A1Z6H9FISXGPQC	When guys like Tex have nowhere  else to go, they always seem to find the path to some god. What a mess!	0
12426	A1NB8TOO5UKL4T	This is a lightweight, harmless chick flick for readers.  Do not expect more or less.  It IS clean, which is a big plus.	1
12427	A8IWHNLTBMCJT	This was a bunch of rubbish, to be frank. The serial killer angle was absolutely pathetically introduced and handled. The characters are all idiots. Just what!?	0
12428	AQ029QMX4ACIW	A very creepy story is all I can say. Not sure if I will ever be able to go to a circus ever again.	0
12429	AH2N0TAXLZPNB	At least it was free.Way to sappy and nothing BUT sex.  I can only read how much someone is in love so ofter without gagging.	1
12430	A3GTWWTJOJ84WR	The love angle is not really believable. She kind of relies on love at first sight a little too hard	1
12431	A8SLY9R0QAGPL	I really didn't like it that much.  But then again if the audience is 12 year old girls then maybe it's okay.	1
12432	A1CT7CV32SR4AE	This book sounded like it would be good, but it was nothing special.  It was too short and i didn't connect with the characters.  The story line was stupid.	1
12433	A3CRMXOFQKFBIY	The story was great !  The graphic  sex...disgusting and un necessary. I would not recommend this book to anyone that I know.	1
12434	A1C90PRXEYHHEA	I found the book completely predictable. The regency period is rather poorly depicted. Georgette Heyer without her humor and style.	1
12435	A33XDOHIYREE23	I do not care for the author.  He sneaks in his political views and they differ from mine in big ways.	0
12436	A9AGJIA6HFYGL	This was a VERY short story (I read it in about 3 hours).  The story line was boring and pointless.Definitely not worth the $1.99 I paid for it.	0
12437	A2DWN2MQYWKGNX	Read too much like a TV soap opera and too predictable. At this point I ahve no interest in reading the rest of the series.	1
12438	ARFRSW6JDNY0	Good erotica but bad everything else. But I suppose that was the point of it anyways. The characters were flat and there was no real conflict. But great intimate scenes.	1
12439	A1I18KYZZQZ034	I don't know what I was expecting, but there was not too much in this book I cared to make.	1
12440	A20GAMHTCUBCDT	Unfortunately, way too needy gal. Got really tired of her. Mr. Hottie needed someone very different.I kept reading just to finish the story.	1
12441	A3HXT56FN2F66X	Too much attention to detail with the bondage and not enough to an actual story.  Cookie cutter characters.  Thank goodness it was brief.	1
12442	A27LWGZMYW3KR	I didn't much care for the book - this isn't the type of thing I like to read.Jan B.	1
12443	A25BFK8KQ56NL5	Didn't even make it halfway through the book - I just couldn't get into it.  Quit after a few chapters	0
12444	A3M6WUS58PCFJ9	I did not learn one single thing from this book that I did not already know. Almost everything is basic common sense.	0
12445	A23WEMR6HY38W2	Lost me in the first chapter. Can't say much about this book but I slogged though the first few pages and put it down. Not my cup of tea.	1
12446	ANU2ZQ5ZPBQL1	Had I known that was all I'd have I wouldn't bothered with it. That wouldn't have gotten me started and there is no way I would have worried with it.	1
12447	A11VQRVZGD0C8R	Not something I would read again.. Sorry but the stories just lack substance .. It's basically &#34;porn&#34; in written form.. Only thing missing is the cheesy music..	1
12448	A3AB2RZW1DOJ15	I thought this would be a good book.  I did not enjoy it much as some of it didn't make sense and some was just plain boring and dumb.	1
12449	A35U11LXNDUE7X	did not like this book not that it was to raw I can take rawdid not like ripping did not like the lawyer either  not well written	0
12450	A3DQ820TK62K7H	Weird book. I did not even know any of these animals existed anymore. I thought they were all extinct.  Just kidding but we did not like it.	0
12451	A30F034T8117CC	Boring sex scenes and a very poor editing job (should I say NO editing job).  Repetitive sex scenes that I did more skipping past than actually reading.	1
12452	ADJV5NUY9FAU2	Not exactly what I had hoped it would be.  Didn't hold my interest, glad it was free and short.  I probably wouldn't recommend it.	1
12453	A1WAWTXQR7KYBC	This is the first book I have read from Mrs Toltzfus. It was a fast read, short but good. I do plan to read more of her books.	1
12454	A3G7OLIC03JCOC	This book started out really good but took a turn I didn't like. At that point, I was done with it.	1
12455	A2LYK1AGZ4U9L8	two ninety nine for twenty pages.  no just on the face of it.  i am assuming people do this just to cash in on current stuff.	0
12456	A123E7RYDT82BH	All I can think about with the story was the author must have been having an off moment. I found this so very bad, and I usually love her stuff.	0
12457	A115FQU49GAZXR	I usually like Ms. Madeiros work, but she rushed things on this one, which made it completely unbelievable. Boo! Hiss!	0
12458	AWX9VVKK8KTI8	its not the worse, but it had a childish feel - maybe im too picky but nothing I would recommend	0
12459	A7LD1TK5M7VAS	Silly cartoon porn. Not something I let my enemy read far less a friend. Trivial shit waste of the ink and paper that printed it	0
12460	A34CRZDZ2FVJ6W	I must have gotten  bad copy of this book.  I had many typos in my version of the book which made it difficult to read and enjoy.	1
12461	A38GT0INCVRS9	If you enjoy reading about any of the above, then this is the book for you. It is a compilation of traditional gore and horror with a softer human touch.	1
12462	A131K2AZ4LWFHW	And nothing more needs to be said. If you want to have your child preached at. This is the book for you.	0
12463	A1UP8V0VT0S4SY	Thanks netgalley for arc. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/943636926?book_show_action=false	1
12464	A1X8YI8EKM8YRA	This was well written but this is just not my kind of erotica. You may well enjoy this. I only read about 1/2 of the book and stopped.	0
12465	A3JNYBOFBT927V	I couldn't get into this one. Way to much exposition and explanation, not enough action moving the story forward. I didn't connect with the characters, either.	0
12466	A2X50W4XPD37UH	Don't waste you money on this one. Worst book I've read in awhile. Stupid plot, stupid ending and full of filthy language.	0
12467	A2DIS9FFG9O66Z	nothing special but nothing bad either. a harmless read when you have nothing to read and it was freeskip it	1
12468	A2O4GFSXGOAG4D	A bit lame glad it was free. Could of been a bit better with out the use of the word buddy	0
12469	A3TLJ77G5WJQ08	This book takes stupid and silly to a whole new level. From ridiculous secret government agencies to some of the dumbest cops imaginable. Thankfully the villein was even dumber.	0
12470	A36HG626U941VX	I read it to the end but wish I had quit earlier.  A better book on survival in the African desert could be interesting.	1
12471	ACJGM77EQ2VS0	I wanted to try a biker series and started with this set. I thought the first novella was okay, but the other two were just not for me.	1
12472	A38N0E300Y3IT6	A really stupid book with huge holes. It started off okay but evolved into a completely unrealistic story. Don't waste your time.	0
12473	A1SFNZ41NQR7WJ	Interesting read.  Not well organized.  Hurried at the end.  I did enjoy it though.  The heroines are sooooo good, and the villains sooooo evil.	1
12474	A2D8R8T4J1AIOQ	Boring, unrealistic, not erotic, just gross. Waste of energy. Waste of download time. Don't download this. Don't read it. Just don't do it.	0
12475	A4G7280Z32IEE	This book brings everything i did not like about the previous books and magnifies them.Stupid dialogue, unrealistic responses and actions. Dues ex machina up the @#%	0
12476	A2Q1QQ7TSHLBQR	This was a fun book, the story was simple but kept moving.  I will probably continue the series even though I'm getting burn out.	1
12477	A2JD13PAIYPS33	This was a short read, well written, but slow paced and boring. It is a sweet story but was not moving in anyway have a promising start.	1
12478	A1UJ2T7XDNOF25	The very poor grammar and spelling combined with a mediocre story and poor explanation of background science was the reason for the one star rating.	0
12479	A2UQ890ZNCRZ7T	It talks a lot about spanking...... If you are into that. I've read better books. Don't waste your time. Waste of money.	1
12480	A1FRYNZ1CA6YT9	This was so short not sure what to say. More like instead of being on its own, could of been a prologue in the book that will share their story.	1
12481	AZAGV6PAOZSKQ	Like it very much.  I can get back to my Kindle Fire faster than I could with my Kindle Touch.	0
12482	AXFW1QY3EIEVA	It was to corny for words.  I kept reading to find out who done it.  That also was to corny for word	1
12483	A3NDEQIIKP0Q46	This not one book I could recommend. It is very convolutions and boring. It has no ending.  Don't waste your time.	0
12484	A3ND55G05V7W6G	I couldn't even finish it. If I could put 0 I would.Both of them were so ridiculous and stupid.	0

12487	A2SSEMZQYI60MG	It was not what I thought I was getting. It is trashy, and could be a good book witout the trash. Like the story line.	1
12488	A26UGZ1PDF7SGH	Okay. Just really didn't care much for this. But I always finish books I start. Good luck on the next one.	1
12489	ACSH8B812AYGK	I had a hard time getting into this book. I got it for free so I thought I would try it, never finished it.	1
12490	AHMOPOXO5MMRB	With the exception of the Genene Jones and Beverly Alloy cases which have made extensive news coverage, these tales are perfunctory.	1
12491	AORL3TEJXSHIR	This story was just one that I could not get into it just did have the story line that pulled me in.	1
12492	A2EUJVX30XHF2X	I discovered, after downloading it that it only contained one month. Considering you would have to keep purchasing it every month it would get expensive  I deleted it..	0
12493	A3V2AF07TMSCB0	After reading and enjoying the authors other great books, I found this one a big letdown. Half way through it I gave up nothing there.	0
12494	A3UOMPA3YBKBNO	I wasn't impress with this book, maybe someone else will love it, have read her book before and loved them	0
12495	A1RAT2F4TCZA3E	Short and not very good! There was nothing to this NO reality, no excitement! No I won't be reading anything else you write!	0
12496	A1GHV20HSBV5Z	It turns turned out that the bad boy, had to learn from all his male friends, that he was really in love with the good guy,all along.	1
12497	ANODGUSSYQZYI	no character building, no story building, no flesh or meat to the entire plot.  weak characters and weak sex scenes.  attraction between the two main characters wasnt believable.....	1
12498	AIV5BZJX9FP4E	I did not read this book,yet. I'm unable to rate something I have not read as of today, maybe in a couple of weeks	0
12499	A1NKLU4ZIAWMHI	Needs an editor to proof mistakes in story and spelling. Needs to pick up the pace to keep reader engaged	1
12500	A8KQLOBO0YEKK	Slow plot development resulted in lost interest.  I didn't identify with the situation.  I guess I just didn't care to go-on.	1
12501	A12UDATYZEMM20	This story ends before it even begins, you have to buy the whole series straight up to get anywhere in the story.	0
12502	AUDSHKDTG7B9D	Admittedly I only read the first story and I could hardly finish it.  The writing is stilted and the characters unreal.	0
12503	A26JPONZ69BAB3	not worth reading	0
12504	A36HG626U941VX	This book didn't appeal to me, so I didn't finish it.  Since I am not a very discriminating reader I am surprised.	1
12505	A7M68XQKGDSLM	Sorry to say this was the most boring book I have ever read..there was nothing interesting in the lives of the characters.	1
12506	A2JS97Y1A15UHV	I was disappointed..the story line and principal character was far fetched to the point of being hard to believe and a major shortcoming.	1
12507	A35LBI5EE15ETV	Not alot of cohesion in explaining nexus, no depth of character and a predictable ending.I would suggest more thought to want the author wants to express.	0
12508	AVRYGBHNOZLWP	Such a beautiful story with so many editing mistakes! Please consider some editing. Totally worth the effort and the cost!	1
12509	A377OHO2E1V54Q	"Nothing new here, 2 recycled stories with no added material...a rip off in the name of ""Christmas"" how nice."	0
12510	A2J8WQHKV75MAS	Tried but just couldn't get into it....wasted my money and deleted them all....soo wish you could get your money back on kindle books :(	0
12511	A2ORZ3QVBGOCON	The ending, while not expected, has been done before. I didn't expect much from a .99cent book and unfortunately I wasn't disappointed.	1
12512	A11FF0H63VFFMX	Short and to the point. Talk about helping someone and not being quick to pass judgment. I kind of like the western feel of it s well.	1
12513	A2DICUVN6CJE4R	Did not enjoy this book. There was no plot and the whole object seemed to be sex. A little too descriptive and seedy for me.	0
12514	AZY0ZLZHJYTSE	THE IDEA OF THIS SHORT STORY MAY MAKE A GOOD FULL LAUGHT BOOK BUT ITS SO SHORT YOU CANT GET INTO IT GO IT WAS NOT INJOYABLE	1
12515	AF1T973VQAQKR	I FOUND THE BOOK TOO SLOW AND QUIT READING IT BEFORE I GOT PAST THE THIRD CHAPTER. WAS ALL THAT INTERESTED IN FINISHING IT EITHER.	1
12516	A9TPV4O2YQJXO	This book was so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first chapter.  Maybe I'm just not deep enough to appreciate the content.	0
12517	A2ZG4S19AVH2G3	This was a review of a book I think. It was not a book. Did not like it at all.	1
12518	A1NDTNDH1NWF7D	Repetitive to ad nauseam. Superabundance of cliches, stereotypes and telegraphed endings, excruciatingly drawn out to the point of sheer agony. Gah!!!	0
12519	A1ZSFVYGK5HLEF	Why was this book ssssssssssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooo short. Are they serious? I was too mad. I thought I was about to get into some good reading and it just ended.	0
12520	A36O7ZVHONIBRU	I wish I had read the reviews before I downloaded this today.  I wasted precious Sunday reading time with a book filled with errors!!!	0
12521	A11ATXABJX9G79	Started out well, but then the story flat-lined and then, poof, it was over.  The explanations of the depression suffered by our heroine was odd.  Felt incomplete at the end	1
12522	AE5IA4M4NQLY	Not interesting enough or well written enough to be three stars. Not so badly written or dull to be only one.	1
12523	A186GV4AM6ZLRN	The title says it all.  Bad.  Don't waste your time or your money.  There are a lot of good books to read out there.  This is not one of them.	0
12524	A3CIIU9YNK53VK	This was a cute little book,  but the format it displayed as was very hard for my daughter to read.	1
12525	A1BKNLD0QJD4CZ	I can't believe I actually paid for these books.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!  I usually read a book until the end, but the story line; everything bothered me about this book.	0
12526	AIQWMQ4JWKZ3T	Just a lot of what you would expect after reading the title.  Not my cup of tea but to each his own.	0
12527	A3J21U8C97UXZA	This was a different take on the wolf stores but it was a slow read. I prefer fast and more action romance.	1
12528	A2NVD4MFH5TAUS	Did not care for these books.  Wish that I had not purchased them.Had a hard time reading them.  So sad.	0
12529	A1BN6ALH0XCV0H	Okay read. I wouldn't recommend it but if you feel like wasting time. This is the book for you plus its free	1
12530	A245ACVO95ODQ5	The plot was scattered and the introduction seemed to take up at least half of the book. A little too mushy and pointless.	0
12531	AMXIF9QHS0V09	I Dont remember it really, remember thinking it wasnt what I was expecting, obviously not memorable enough to rate earlier	1
12532	A144HNNRXT0W1K	Very mundane book. Too much back and forth between the characters and the police. The plot could have been more suspenseful.	1
12533	A3IODPL4ZJD58N	This story was hard to get through because the grammar was so poor.  Listen, there are several services available for this.  The author could start with spell check.	1
12534	ATUJ0GHYB7RV8	ExcellentAll. Books in Jesus William series are wonderful. My only problemIs I can not put them down. Please keep writing.	1
12535	A150HF52WXHN36	This story had no substance; there were parts that were unrealistic and redundant. I won't be buying the next book in this series.	1
12536	A319NIGXKIFSSW	Not enough variety in fruits. Not enough variety in vegetables. Not enough variety in ideas. Just plain, not enough. I would recommend looking at other diet books.	1
12537	A1L545ISQ41MZJ	DID NOT SERVE AS HOPED ITEM RETURNED PLAN ON SEARCHING FOR ITEM THAT WILL..CASE DID NOT HOLD KINDLE SECURE .SLIPPED OUT WHEN IN STANDING POSITION.	0
12538	A7ZBUTJOWLGEB	It is a short story and as such the pleasure is such. I woudn'y have bought it knowing it was a short story	1
12539	A153CLP1R55I8V	The author had a great story line/idea but 80% of the book was sex scenes. This book just needed more.	1
12540	A2FNN34IFSS5I5	Now I hope the rest of the story is over quickly. Im tiring of the same things being said over and over.. And blah blah blah. Sorry	1
12541	A17PS64UZCXC6Y	I still expect erotica to be written well and some of these stories weren't and some were just dumb.  Most needed a good editor or beta reader.'	1
12542	A2WF93EYZ3A0XX	Truly this was a disappointment.  I did not love it or like the writing of this book.  Please rewrite your story.	0
12543	AQ19VNJBKOX7	Ok this book was super short and kinda weird.  I mean who does what this girl does the FIRST time she meets her boss??  Very strange story...	1
12544	A3KWLE7H7QYUOJ	this book is supposed to be authored by the killer, at bestit is not very good. he blames everyone except himself for thiscrime, do not waste your time	1
12545	A165ZFBYAHWO52	This was a pretty pointless story that I found unsuitable for children of any age. I would not recommend it to any one	0
12546	A13VIG4ZRKG3TH	I found it  very hard to get into the story.  The plot itself seemed okay, it just wasn't for me.	1
12547	AR9RB7WZ3SBJ0	I tried to read this book, but gave up as it didn't seem to appeal to me, sorry maybe for others	0
12548	AGMBIJWLYNM5E	Can we say RAPE-Y!!!  There is no disguising that this was not romance, it was rape!  All the five star reviews are really disturbing!	0
12549	A3UPQVI7JXR7X0	"A kind of cute story, but I don't care for the swearing, especially the ""f"" word.  I probably won't buy one of her books again."	1
12550	A2GYX7MZ67T0C7	No pictures and descriptions are weak. Enthusiastic verbiage and little substance. No mention of where to obtain structures suggested for use in vertical gardening.	1
12551	A1ULRFNOXE2I08	I waited for this stupid third book and it was a complete waste of my time!!!!!!  So stupid and a stupid ending to boot!!!	1
12552	A2B7LDIHK24FOC	This was such a let-down I cannot even remember what it was about.  I could barely get thru it, and it was a very short story....	0
12553	A1C59O7ESMVL8L	Fire creates evidence it doesn't destroy it. Proof that the cops can make a thousand mistakes a crook can only make one.	1
12554	A12DGHTSKZFYLO	There was nothing erotic about that. It was a tease and disappointment instead of erotic romance, did not like it much.	1
12555	A2S3YMM57OHI1J	Lost interest rather quickly. Predictable.	1
12556	A2DICUVN6CJE4R	I couldn't read the whole book. It was really quite boring and predictable. The characters were shallow and the plot did not hold my attention.	1
12557	A2XPHUKLUWEYOV	I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK I GUESS IT JUST WAS NOT MY TYPE IT WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO SUBMISSIVE FOR ME	1
12558	A2Y7ECHF67O226	Some stories were better than others but if you think you want to read straight through don't bother downloading this free book.	1
12559	A3CUWRVAKGEFHL	This book of supposedly best jokes is a joke.  Maybe grade schoolers would enjoy it but I didn't even find one joke mildly amusing.	0
12560	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	If this book is not free, do not both reading it. As long as you don't have to pay, then it isn't that bad.	0
12561	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	Boring book. Didn't take long to figure that one out! Don't waste your hard earned money! Total disappointment! Had to give it the one star!	0
12562	A34KD80BAXVOZ3	The story was too short.  I was very upset because it was a pretty great story line, it was very short lived.  I wanted it to be longer,	0
12563	A3V3OE9BRKSE35	the concept of the story is good  mid-life love, not young loveIt started dragging in the middle  did not finish	1
12564	A1JRRDS066HDXP	I know it was a short story but I think it need a few more pages to finish the story. Felt like I was left hanging in the end.	1
12565	A1MNNZPB4EV169	I aam going to clean out my Kindle today and take this series out.  The stories are so simple that they put me to sleep.  Please don't bother downloading this.	1
12566	A2UEVIIDLL6J4L	I really thought the storyline was dumb.  I could only get about 75% into it.  It was boring and really lame.  I thought it looked intriguing.	0
12567	A2IMMJHL8J9X3F	This is a sweet romance and it has some adventure.  The relationships between the two hero's are funny and rascal which was kind of comical.	1
12568	A1M2EE2RF4UGG7	This book started out great, and it had so much potential.  Everything was over described, but I felt there was nothing to keep me reading.	1
12569	A383RRJFO33TDD	Was hoping for something a little more mystery and challenge. It was a quick read. Okay for a beach read maybe.	1
12570	A1DC00T32U26HC	This is a different book. Not a love story. Lots of fighting and corruption. Not really my interest. Not badly written.	1
12571	A2NV8ECUE5QPAW	Poorly written and ripped from the tabloids. The only redeeming quality is its merciful brevity. Should be rated negative stars, or ten thumbs down.	0
12572	APH9I3BH2F9BA	Had enough, by the end of this.  Not going to start the next if there's a book five.  I came to dislike the Irish redhead...lol	1
12573	A2YDSN72HU0KPR	I didn't finish it.  The writing is a little trite and the characters felt like they came out of a B horror movie.	1
12574	A2AICAH7JA31ZV	I wanted something I could do on road trips.  This one was not very user-friendly for a beginner like me.	1
12575	A2HUVS5F8FQKBG	Please do not read this book it's long drawn out and just plain awful the sad thing is I paid for it	0
12576	A2FAU4U849PEPU	Too graphic for me.  Bought it by mistake.  Sorry I did.  Some people are into this stuff but I am not.	0
12577	ABW8ZL231G2TP	It's not worth the money I spent on this, and it was free.  Weak plot development, almost non-existent character development.  It sucks.	0
12578	A1CYWBI0494JXD	I love the horror genre and picked this book to read at Halloween.  Tried several times to finish it and have not made it past chapter 4 yet.	0
12579	A3IF89JE3HT12D	There are some good ideas here but I really question the carb counts. Bread crumbs and pasta...hum. This book also does not give service size amounts. Glad it was free!	1
12580	A10O47ZJBWM73K	Started in the middle of a story... thrown together.... meant to be fantasy i know.... but unbelievable storyline.... ends suddenly. I am not a writer and could have done better	0
12581	A2K5JIKNF2LMT5	This book is too small and doesn't give enough to describe a fight scene. Write the Fight Right, which was written by professionals, is better than this book.	1
12582	A3HRO0PRVEN7S	I did not find any new information here that has not already been covered at the doctor's office... This may be informative only if you know nothing on the subject.	1
12583	A2WC3U93V68DXR	Funny and interesting! This was a quick tead, but was quirky and fun. It had athe good story. It was worth the quick read.	1

12585	A3R90OQYLOIZMZ	This book reminded me of the cheesy B movies on the SiFy channel. Put together real fast and bad actors.	1
12586	A3LAJTQXS4ZK4C	i was not impressed with this book at all...i have to think of something else to say so that it wll let me save this review. Not Impressed	1
12587	A2968FKGJ9XEAL	This was a mistake on my part. I thought I would like this type of material, but I don't. Please deleted this from my file.	1
12588	AL9EIC4OFHRP2	Not near as good as the first two books. Way over-the-top romantic scenes and the writing left a lot to be desired.  You can definitely tell the authors have changed.	1
12589	A3N03ZI4TN8NG	The game asks you the exact same questions over and over. So it's not any fun or in the least bit challenging.	1
12590	AN2K1EOEPLWF3	It just wasn't for me, I guess.  The &#34;heroine&#34; seemed really insipid... the other characters were bland... it was a very forgetful book.  Sorry.	1
12591	ALHM275M0FKYP	Poorly written and boring the story is all.over the place and the character of Ivy is an idiot and unconvincing	0
12592	A1IIWXM8FQ9DB7	Terrible! I love Victorian but this was vulgar. I never finished the first chapter..I thought the story line was interesting.	0
12593	A2UH7EMPH4GK2L	This story seemed more like several stories shoved together than one, coherent story. The author introduced several plots but then went nowhere with them. I found this book really tiring.	0
12594	A2OAY1UFN99HSX	Too slow of pace. This was actually kind of boring. It's seriously lacking in realism and the characters didn't seem real and I couldn't be drawn into the experience	0
12595	A2EW9VQ5FG1L80	Not well written. Seems to be a collection of homilies by the writer but there is a lack of coherence to the whole thing. I deleted from my Kindle.	0
12596	A2LE6C17O09CR3	I didn't like this book. It was not at all interesting and not what I thought it would be. Do not recommend.	0
12597	A16F370EO0DIB4	This book was ok! It wasn't that much going on! Ended too soon & and it seemed a little rushed	1
12598	ASRM6ZXM5EQS7	A two minute book. You need to think about that .  All It did was make me angry.  I really wanted to read	0
12599	A3FFFZX9SXC74S	I didn't like the writing style of this book. It didn't hold my interest. I just couldn't get into it.	1
12600	A6QKSIUNG8KP7	i guess i just dont like reading about the goings on of the aristocracy. no real surprises. expected more from the novel	1
12601	A25XKFRQN9WJK2	Why pay even a dollar and clutter your kindle when ell of this is available elsewhere - and for free? Just go to the author's blog!	0
12602	AV76UEGYMLFDS	I did not like this book much it was Pain and boring I will not be getting the rest of the series	0
12603	A33COFFCC5DKL8	Silly but fun.  Not much on reality so good to get your mind off your troubles type of book.  I enjoyed it.	1
12604	A23J1UKGS9PMPW	No revelations here or new ideas.  Other than being a 15 minute free read, not much more was offered by the author.	0
12605	A28REJAM6899K8	Nice storyline but it moved a little too slow for me. I think there was too much lagging going on.	1
12606	A10S5XDNWATLRO	The novel focused too much on the gory details of the twisted murders for me. If you like twisted tales of murder you will probably like this.	0
12607	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	I fail to see the humor in this book.It was fortunate that it was a freebie. I found it a waste of time to read. SORRY!	1
12608	A1FWYH1HGGZS9L	Good story...wish it had a natural progression like longer stories...plot was ok not the the greatest..not the best I have read	1
12609	A116NINE21FUNZ	I like this series. I just wish it had been longer and more character background. It is over too quick.	1
12610	ATT80J7U3U6YB	Found I did not like people central to stories or any introduced in first chapter. Glad the book was free.	1
12611	A29OBTJRFR6FVD	I am not saying it was bad it was just in your face sex....... I thought it was a simple love story.	1
12612	A2XD5QYE4JGMMF	I gave this book two stars because I found it to be implausible and simplistic.  It started out alright but became obvious and repetitious.	1
12613	APZKII3BV6SWM	Ummm might be worst book I have ever read!!!! I read the sample and thought it was cute, do not let the sample fool you!	0
12614	ANW4DDF18BMW2	Just couldn't pictures these characters as real and got tired of Kylie and her whiny attitude.  Not worth my time.	1
12615	A1DC00T32U26HC	Lots of different stories with different people. Some better than others. Most were a turn on. Mostly a pretty good read.	1
12616	A1AVMV6L6ARGFG	This story contains all the cliches - forbidden fruit, heavily hung black men, intimidated white husband....it was just awful.I should ask for a refund!	1
12617	AOWINULGE4WM6	The author seems somewhere between a teenager and a librarian. Not only was there no suspense, details were explained in excruciating detail.	0
12618	A3UJA2Q8334B8A	I found this book poorly organized and written. I have deleted it from my Kindle, and I would not suggest it to my students.	0
12619	AOGEZCVSI20MM	This was not an enjoyable read for me. There were too many places where the story got stalled with unneeded details.	1
12620	A2C3ZJT5S4C2T6	I thought the story line was slow and too wordy although the title was intriguing.  I was disappointed once I began reading.	1
12621	A1KRYEH6EDGQ6E	Not very helpful at all.  Didn't have anything that made me glad I bothered with book. There are much better weight watcher books out there.	1
12622	A32AUTWA8MM81K	Wayyyy toooooooo graphic!  This is NOT  REGENCY.  THIS IS TOOOOOOOO GRAPHIC. NO REAL THOUGHT INTO THE BUILD UP. NOT WORTH IT,	0
12623	AJHFQ3CB5TBEP	I really dont even know  where to begin this book was a mess!!!!  All over the place mumbo jumbo! It was awful. Hopefully the author will do better next time.	0
12624	A1LV6FS76T3ROJ	I know this sounds crazy, but many paranormal stories are, at least (Somewhat) believable.  Not this one, everything happened way too fast.	1
12625	A1BAUKLX26XYFW	Not sure what all the 5 stars were about. This was truly terrible. Hoping I can save someone .99 cents	0
12626	A3OGSXZ69GKY2S	I disliked the lead so much I kept wishing she would die. There is nothing I would recommend about this book!	0
12627	A1G6VT6ISLANS3	Missing too much and way, way,way too much descriptive.I like almost barfed. Too much sexual content.like most of the book is just about sex! It's horrible.	0
12628	A3K1A3MUYKQ9B9	What can I say, I did not like this novel at all.  I guess it is just not my 'cup of tea' for good reading.	1
12629	AYB90RJXY32BI	Immensely Strange read. No plot and point that I discern. There is no connection to the characters and story . The characters were very without details.	1
12630	ATDVJ7SL7JDW2	It is an extremely short story. And I would have like it to be a little longer, maybe a love interest.	1
12631	A1Y1TUZOYRDMI6	She meets a man and 8 days later is ready to marry him. It ended to quickly, I felt it could have been written better.	1
12632	A3JN4W4TCJLWXT	The subject matter seemed enticing, but the reading never captured my interest.  I finally gave up.  Who cares if these people have to go to prison?	1
12633	A13YY15JMQ5DC3	I actually was hoping for more.  I read this in 15 minutes.  not speed reading either.  anything that short is not a book.  sorry.	1
12634	AAXLZ5RY8JGD5	Could have done without what basically amounted to bestiality. Wasn't prepared for that, wasn't entirely sure what was going on, nope.	0

12637	A1M43GYGPUA6VO	Too many fat-heavy ingredients.  This book reinforces the sad but too often true portrayal of all southerners as fat and &#34;happy&#34; in their ignorance.	0
12638	A30411QNHGSW5Y	His Island Bride, while not written poorly, was overly simplistic in its telling. It was almost juvenile the way the characters thought and talked.	1
12639	A30T10J3S3CZEF	I could not finish this book.  The author &#34;told&#34; us everything. There was no flow. She needs a good editor.	0
12640	AGXU7GBAHY78S	This book was terrible, one huge cliche.  Hot but conflicted hero, beautiful,classy, perfect, stupid heroine and of coarse mean, evil fiancee of hero.  I returned this for a refund.	0

12645	A2WB908KV1WUG6	These characters are lame. This is the last time I'll read a Manny Williams book. The plot is just too cheesy for me.	0
12646	AEL4IHFON0696	Interactive humor mostly enjoyable but got old and older as things progressed.  Motives and procedures way too convoluted.  Why did it take SO long to solve?	1

12651	AM9EN51BXKPM	It was a novella. It was just okay and that's why I don't generally read them.  Not enough to really get into the story.	1
12652	AQYWYT30BU5GL	in the name of humor ...this  is pure  propoganda against current president. Booo to the Republican author for this sham!a	0
12653	AYFZQGQDXIR5J	Bought this and in reading it, I realized it was totally lifted from one of his books.  I'm disappointed and feel like I've been ripped off.	0
12654	A1CF2XZW51HZRP	I found the whole thing somewhat offensive, and not in a good way. I wouldn't bother if I were you. Needs editing too.	0

12659	A1Y5WY5XCNJJ25	The print version of USA Today has a weekend edition. I never got this while subscribed. Also, I saw a couple photos, but no charts, graphics, etc.	1
12660	A1KQ03LSL10FX1	The blurb captured my attention but it wasn't long before the poor writing and choppy story just became too much to deal with.  Never finished.	1

12664	A2PP0MHQ3DXJN2	This book is basically repeating the same info as as loyalty and respect. Come on now Drea you must do better than this next time.	0
12665	A7BJB12NIAGM4	Not worth the time it took to read. The characters lacked personality and there heroine was too one dimensional. Would definitely not recommend.	0

12670	A2SO0HUALP4C5E	The title for this review tells it all. Started it but quickly grew bored with it and put it down, not to go back to it.	1
12671	A3KUV0F3OV4L64	I wasn't too thrilled with this tale, but it works to some degree. There are parts that held me captive and some that left me wanting. It's just OK.	1
12672	A1U7MB6RWCYUKC	When I thought the book was getting started it was over. What I read was well written and interesting but it was over before it got started.	1
12673	A2539ZDDALTYR7	I guess I don't understand why the characters jumped into bed so quickly. Where I come from people have a relationship first and then sex. It was just ok.	1
12674	A1TGSSYT00RWS6	The book is poorly written.  She did not research that the Amish male and female's do not sit together at church services.  Very boring.	0

12680	A332Q8YWI42J90	I really hated this book to the utmost.  Most of the stories were undefinable, proof readers were asleep and couldnt tell when stories ended.	0
12681	A3M10LCG67EI2R	This is why men think all young women can be disrespected, and do not work hard and earn things academic.	0
12682	AB06148H5TRT7	Not the whole book, has info at end on buying complete story. Not worth reading. Really boring and not much like the description,would hardly call it riveting.	0

12689	A33EXOL2EHAKMO	The premise for this story is ridiculous, it is overdone, and overall just really raunchy. Not worth the free download.	0

12691	A2OYAWB6WBANCI	I usually look forward to a follow up book of a really good first effort but this one not nearly close.	1
12692	AGH741HGPOLV2	I could not make it through this book. Slow and gross. If you are this patient, read OSC's Xenocide or Dickens instead.  Sorry.	0
12693	A2ESQG15E87L4L	Couldn't even get past chapter three. The characters were so bland and boring. There was zero personality. So I'm not even going to bother finishing this book.	0

12709	A3TYWLLZGB1EDR	This is the carp you get when you just willy-nilly grab free books. I did not bother to finish it.	0
12710	A2JFFQN4ZQSQ4O	This book was just not very humorous. I didn't find myself laughing hardly at all. Lots of jokes, just not ones I enjoyed.	1

12716	AVRDLNR8ZTHCE	This book was too short and it didn't have much of a story line to support it.  I would no waste my money.	1
12717	A2DQWWJ2HYR5C0	Tee shirts, bumper stickers, internet memes, and materials stolen from celebrities retold badly and in no particular order. Don't bother.	0

12725	AATLBD76PJ5OW	I didn't enjoy this as I found the plot very week and of little substance. Perhaps a good idea was ruined by not expanding it into a full story.	1
12726	AM8W121W592CP	It wasn't long enough to get the story told. It was boring and even though it was short it was hard for me to finish.	1

12728	ADPNU2HN74FSI	Rather forgettable.  I also would have liked more background about the main character.  I would have liked to have seen the relationship between the girl and the prisoner play out.	1
12729	A2TZDW14PLBJ4T	I was on page 30 before I gave up. Writing style all over the place...	0
12730	A1A8CZ4C7V385N	Did not like at all and would not recommend this book to anyone....too much vulgarity.  Other authors can tell a great story without all the cusing.	0
12731	A1I18PL2FENWY2	I erased this book from my device without finishing it.  I thought it might get interesting once I got into it, but it didn't.	0
12732	AC518E7FF67BF	I enjoyed this novel with so many different situations that kept you wanting to read more. The characters were very interesting.	1
12733	A3RCSUN35QXOPI	Was this even an interracial story. I read the sample and it was all over the place. Will not waste time with purchasing the book.	0
12734	A3GXZHUXGNW502	I've read worse. Nothing really exciting. Very predictable.  Authors meaning is very understandable but not as good as her Fixed trilogy.	1
12735	AIXRHWJ7Z1M6W	This book talks about nothing except drugs. However, I shall continue reading the series in hope of it getting better.	1
12736	A8880EF8FPK22	I would not have purchased this book if I had know it was about some era in the past...never clear when that was....	1
12737	A1DP9LKVRC89LM	I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK OR THE SUBJECT MATERIAL. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS BOOK. HOWEVER I KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD ENJOY IT	1
12738	A35LBI5EE15ETV	Each story I read had the same view of Time travel.  After 4 of them did not finish the book.	0
12739	A1Y5WY5XCNJJ25	I know that some very good books can have unexpected endings, but this was just strange. It was as if someone just chopped off part of the book.	1
12740	ANOSVLTGRKABQ	This diet is such a waste. It's a waste of the paper it was printed on. It has the most basic info, not even worth reading.	0
12741	A26WRBI72Q7OYM	This book is ok, it's the only book I've read with this character.  Not sure I would read others with this character.	1
12742	A2P35QMJT5M7JZ	The writing was very elementary. I hope future stories by the author create a more enchanting picture of the characters world and feelings.	0
12743	A197W8MNF706HT	I got 35% into the book.  If I get that far and I still don't get it, I'm done. I couldn't feel it or really understand it.	0
12744	A279X8Q86JF5VR	Just a table of contents and index , no actual stories, so it wasn't what I was looking for at all.	0
12745	A2TDO3HSOCPZO3	Never liked stories where someone is so desperate to belong that they do anything to get in an organization. Just was not into it.	1
12746	A92P78XO6JJSY	I got it free, glad I didn't pay $$.  I really can't recommend this, you would find better recipes on-line.	1
12747	AG64F1ZZ9GUVY	I think this is a book for teenage girls.Exceedingly simple plot.It held no interest for me at all.	1
12748	A3O93U4B9C94J7	Thought this novella was pointless. I guess I expected more of his POV to make me actually like him but it didn't work out that way.	1
12749	A1WRC15T9EJQOE	It was a great mistake listening to a recommendation. After flipping the pages, this wasn't the type of book that I would have borrowed, would have known better. Sorry.	1
12750	A1FV0SX13TWVXQ	This is another one of those that I didn't finish as I didn't care for it right from the start.	1
12751	AVVEA0Z4U5PFB	I could not get past the first 2 pages. Porn is porn no matter how you try to &#34;dress&#34; it up.	0
12752	A25SSWA53F2YIB	I liked this book, but not as others I have read about Lincoln.It did not give a lot of perspective about his feelings.	0
12753	A1GH0Z016U4UP8	Could've been more in depth truthfully. It Seemed rushed , the story line was nice but it's missing so much that it's hard to actually like the story	1
12754	A04666331NYU0YWTDI5DA	Why why why,when will the happy ending come,I love the mind blowing sex they have,but it's not enough I want it to end already	1
12755	A203JM3B17GVF6	I was hoping for more mystery and less romances. Could have been a goid story if it had less of the the sex scenes.	1
12756	A3D95VGKRXG2O7	This book was so boring that I zoned out while reading this. The most ratchetness I've read ever. I will not be reading number two.	0
12757	A1NSQ9EHF7SM5E	The writing was horrible! The grammatical errors were outrageous and the story had so many unbelievable actions!!!! I'm not she I even want to read the other parts	1
12758	A1TP5R7TPHT7XK	First, cover trashy; nothing til the end even mentioned faith; story line unbelievable.  This should not be offered as Christian fiction.	1
12759	AA8Q9WG76DXR0	I didn't make it through two chapters.  Give me something more original than a pompous 'hero' with a chip on his shoulder.  Boring.	0
12760	AJV87JET57AB0	I actually never read the preview. If it had been the entire book I would have read it and probably enjoyed it. I do like james patterson books	0
12761	AFS3R3PDPPDSG	I haven't used one of these recipes and won't ever. I am not going to give any reasons. I like to come up with my own things I guess.	1
12762	A1UTNYFFVJBOUI	It was rushed, the plot made little to no sense at times. The main character was infuriating. Just, no. Never.	0
12763	A2B69CZ1JT3PKS	This book is ok.... I think maybe it was written by a young child. It's a little weird. At least it's free	1
12764	A54JN5HQVSM5D	Not at all what I expected, just kind of went no where. Good thing it was short or I might not have finished it.	1
12765	A2YFNDNQ8F8JX0	Strange story.  I didn't even finish reading it.  I like the biblical description of Heaven, not this weird place that does not even resemble the truth.	1
12766	A35RQ5CPU9FSO4	Not really ghost stories at all. Short stories that end abruptly just when I was getting interested. Not what I expected at all.	1
12767	AB4V97ANL9BMX	This book is good for a New cake decorator, but has little to nothing for an experianced decorator. The cakes are very simple.	1
12768	A3216OIC4N2V8A	Ok I was really getting into the story and then it stopped! The description didn't say it was a sample......am I missing something??	1
12769	A21K9CF22PAGL5	I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS BOOK. I STARTED READING IT BUT ONLY MADE IT THROUGH THE SAMPLE.  IT JUST DIDN'T HOLD MY ATTENTION.	1
12770	A12DGHTSKZFYLO	It was ok but a little bit of a let down I was expecting a little more umph to the story.	1
12771	A317QDJ4KBVLON	I didn't like the story line, I thought it would be more interesting after her mother's suicide. Its ending I didn't like or how it went.	1
12772	A2X17VSGMYALGC	Two stars for correct grammar and spelling. It is an okay way to waste 20 minutes but nothing new or exciting here.	1
12773	ABUX9ZRT6U66N	I was going to get this book as I was told it was free and when I went to get it was going to be charged. Apparently its a scam	0
12774	A1NP31O522FN1V	Could not even finish the book...In spite of having an intriguing story line and a good start.	1
12775	AWXM7P5KO6DLA	It didn't even start with in the beginning crap I think how.Will children learn with this book ugh rubbish crap	0
12776	A2WZNZSA6ID1AE	Save your money... the cabbage soup diet recipe is FREE online all over the recipe sites, and the original one is even on Wikipedia.	0

12778	A2LW8O5FUAGBHT	I hate this book because they don't give you all of the whole story . I don't recommend this bookLove.Devinity	0
12779	A1WVVKAJ2YPLD	Like warm. Described as hot and dark and it was a bit of a bore. Characters pretty one dimensional. Descriptions of sex lame, &#34;his stalk&#34;? Eww.	1
12780	A21IBKKR6F9YMG	So boring I could not finish reading it.  Gosh I could have written better!  Hate to be so harsh but that's it.	0
12781	AW3W148Q0OKOD	It's really sad to see so many of our young brother's and sister's patronizing and idolizing this kind of violence, vulgarity and poorly-written wanna-be literature. This is just plain awful!	1
12782	AO5Y3RQJEL3MF	These stories went straight to the groin. I was hoping for a little sensual enjoyment. If you want porn, Not found here.	1
12783	AL62PMRZ0KDLV	Was not one that I really enjoyed reading. Thought it was associated with another book I read and wasn't. Not that great a read.	1
12784	A1BS6VRABFIMI7	The story is lacking and parts are rushed with no development of plot or the characters. It had potential but I think it needs work.	1
12785	A21TYX363P1514	seems like common sense to me. everything is self explanatory and just a refresher course in how to survive in a disaster.	1
12786	A2IT8UMUMXR2BS	I'm writing for my husband,he did not like this book he couldn't get in to it.it just wasn't what he wanted to read	1
12787	A2DQWWJ2HYR5C0	Don't bother. It's been done before and by far better writers. The only plus was that this was a freebie.	1
12788	A1OJ3G5TH883QS	I am really looking for a book authors information on drying  foods or using a dehydrator and what ones are better.	1
12789	A1GOGSMOXRTYW8	Not a very substantial book and written in a very sketchy way.  It needed more details, more stories, more meat on the bare bones.	1
12790	A1TT2Z3LIRL4JG	Thin story. Wanted more than just a teaser. The bad thing about books these dayis the series concept. What happened to just one book?	1
12791	A39UA2TO5448N3	This book was so stupid, the plot line so ridiculous that I hope nobody spends a penny on it. It was really stupid and that's being nice!	0
12792	AU5ADU1WXN090	I couldn't find one recipe that I didn't already have or wanted to try. There was nothing new in this book for me.	1
12793	A1KEJMKKQRMDUE	If this is a book it would we'll be trash. Stupid woman getting in harm's way with out a bit of thought.  Stellitos in a bakery what an unprofessional attitude.	1
12794	A3M595YFFY08VZ	Started out seeming like a good, cute story, but the rampant sex scenes quickly took over and I didn't even finish the story.	1
12795	A2B9C3FMYW18UN	I really enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting and the story line was good. I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. It was a short story.	1
12796	AQTD6HHJ4Q132	The ingredients are listed clearly, however, the methods for preparation and cooking are frequently not specific enough for someone new to this type of food preparation.	1
12797	A1WBR1N30XIPDU	It is disappointing that the tense used throughout the story shifts from present to past. It makes it difficult to read.	0
12798	A1KF8SQ291JDIH	I thought it was going to be free all the time and it was just a trial to be free	1
12799	AJPBKCXT80WIP	If I could've rated this book 0 stars, that would've been more accurate. The editing was non-existent. The writing was elementary. The storyline was weak. Need I go on?	0
12800	A37Y1IPBIR51JG	the writing was not smooth too wordy in description kept hoping it would grab me never did hoping for more	0
12801	A10C3068FTNIOC	This was an okay read, but it was too drawn out.  The dialog had much to be desired too.  I liked the characters and the story though.	1
12802	ABQX3ECMZSFLO	How on earth does this qualify as erotic? 50% through all that has happened is a kiss. It felt as though it was written by someone very immature.	1
12803	A19ZGAT6IMFY8L	Gore filled if that is what the reader wants but unbelievable zombies that think, are smart and snack on toddlers.	0
12804	A2URKTSEU0R9YW	I read the book only because I bought it. I suppose I've been too spoiled by other authors as this book lacked serious adventure.	1
12805	A2Q5WE1MY3E1QX	It should be zero. This story is proof you should read the description first. It is prevented and disgusting. Don't waste your time.	0
12806	A31HOMGN89LURN	no plot...ridiculous trash talk...just bad, bad, bad.  I also hate these serial novellas...they are almost always terrible and this one is not exception.	0
12807	AVCJZE9X6VLE3	I was not real pleased with this story. it was especially short and didn't even really start a story line. it was a 7 minute read. disappointed	1
12808	A36OMDARF9HQHJ	The romance between the two Marine officers distracted me from the main plot. To kill off a baby to make the heros love life come together is twisted and sick.	0
12809	A3ESG13CT75CZX	I'm not sure if it's because it's not the about the Hollows, but I can't seem to get into it at all	0
12810	AAKOIU8E3X56L	I did not even finish reading deleted - I hated itWould not recommend at all, a waste of money	0
12811	AK6Z4WDTZBDXY	This was 5 pages of pure crap. No thought behind the story or romance at all. This was far from erotic or even worth the review.	0
12812	A3OC8ZG1S3OAVA	A lot of bickering and misunderstanding, but not a lot else.  Really not much interaction between the parties in this short story.  Didn't impress me.	1
12813	A2D6B2K8CM1FHG	Book ended before it finished.  Could have been a good read.  Will try to stay away from these type of books in the future.	1
12814	A3JUTTIFPQXJ8K	Anna and Dan- what a cute story. I would be interested in reading more of this series by Katie Crabapple.	1
12815	A3TL5R9VXKZHUG	Not that great i D&iacute;d not enjoy this book would not recomnd it.	1
12816	A33XXDOI9X064	Save your money.  Not worth the download even if it was free.  I am not a writer but I could do better than this!	0
12817	AJDAPSUP5XA7T	Was not crazy about the way it was written. Could have been more details. To many gaps between chapters. Unlikable characters.	1
12818	ARP7RFS0DPP8P	Juvenile - horribly juvenile. Ridiculous characters and mechanical sex scenes that are also completely unrealistic. I should have heeded the critical reviews. Returned for refund. Enough said.	0
12819	A2OJ5J9RBMJZZQ	Didnt like the story - it needs a lot more oomph.  I regret buying it and would suggest money could be better off spent elsewhere.	0
12820	A2VVKYAH1ATSM	while it did have some good info, there were only about a dozen herbs mentioned. I was disappointed with that...but it was free at the time so :/	1
12821	A1Q5ZFMWQ6X9C3	Really bad, a lousy love story with unexplainable behavior of the main characters, could have been great, but the too big focus on the love story was a downer.	0
12822	AGXD39481H1CZ	I've. Always been a Koontz fan but this story was a disappointment - seemed forced and disconnected with no real plot line	1
12823	A2GJHBMPZ684IU	This book comes out swinging and does not provide any backing. It's hard to follow. Maybe I missed a series or book to tie this together.	0
12824	A3M6WUS58PCFJ9	Every one of these text look like they were screenshots from 1 or 2 phones.To me it seems like they were created by a writer (single).	1
12825	A1YIGJZKOECU3M	I would not recommend even bothering yo read this short story. It was silly boring and had me wanting it to end.	0
12826	AGWHFW6UNXDL0	This is a very boring book I do not think I will be reading anymore books by this author. It seems as though the writer was very young and inmature.	0
12827	A3VQ34Q8V0J9DW	I was not prepared for this type of a book.  I do not like time travel romances, that I have found out.	1
12828	A38ZV2FL84EUF5	I didn't realize this was this kind of book.  I didn't pay attention.  I was hoping for something more like &#34;What to Expect&#34;.	0
12829	A2VN1ZJY12PKDN	Not a bad taste of the story. Makes you want to know their history, how she became his captive, more of their sex!	1
12830	AQPGZAEKIGOHA	Didn't finish this book it didn't hold my interest in it. It was a a mistAke in ordering it . It wasn't my type of book	0
12831	A38DIX88M5T94P	Another don't. Just let this series goDon't bother to keep looking into what happens. Forget it, look for something else	0
12832	A3361XGKYF17S3	I didn't really care for this book, all the other Brides of Beckham books I've read so far I've loved them, I guess I was alittle disappointed in this one.	1
12833	A2C967K424J0JH	To much going on in the story. Didn't always know who was talking or why things were happening. It was ok but not great and not enough romance.	1
12834	A26QAAOXASG882	Just plain nonsensical on so many levels.  I gave up 2/3rds of the way through, since the suspension of disbelief was simply not possible, as so little made any sense.	0
12835	A658TH2N8M22M	not worth the money. very vague and throw together concepts. this ebook was not that motivational, it did not really address the clutter problem in detail.	0
12836	A165ZFBYAHWO52	I was not please with this series of books that I got for my grandson (he is 13 years old)	0
12837	A1KSD2CR0SZSKX	This book has strong characters, but the fighting, battles and conflicts seem neverending.  While a good military book may catch my imagination, this one is not it.	1
12838	APVZYNOME3CLV	I do not like this one please remove it from my library.  Thanks, cj	0
12839	A1XLWKOY6AC0H8	i was not crazy about this book, i ready didn't like the ending, it should have been diff, but thanks for the read	0
12840	A1SMFSKUDOMV1Q	Good detective story with sexy love backround	1
12841	ABRKZ9QXOGBTF	If you are looking for a quick trifle with plenty of lust, this is just as good as the next. It does, however, come off a bit contrived.	1
12842	ANG3AR9SXMXOR	It wasn't that interesting. Not my kind of book it had supernatural stuff but it was boring. Not gonna try reading book two	0
12843	A2NCFPMDURE5YI	A lote off info on what Coeliac Cisease, little on what food to eat and how to mantan it. Verey over welming.	1
12844	A2R1BCBQ3JXBIU	Maybe it just wasn't a story made for me, but the book was an effort to read. Didn't bond with the characters.	1
12845	A2TGSUC0L20JMO	this book was not engaging at all i couldnt finish it and it wasnt very good at all i dont recommend it	1
12846	A2GIFDZJCAFSLJ	I did not like the plot . It wasn't something that kept me on my toes. All though I do like the characters of the book.	1
12847	A2F5K1M79GW649	Was not expecting the language and the graphic scenesThis is one that you really have to be ready for this one	1
12848	A2F43ZCDNT1FYF	I didn't really care for this book.  II thought I would like it but not my cup of tea.  I would rather have read a story with more detail.	1
12849	A6TEQMZJO7TVY	I guess I'm not as much a panini lover as the other reviewers because I didn't find it nearly as great as others seem to have.  Glad it was free!	1
12850	A321G7GC36M1V6	Not what I expected. Wanted more when story ended. Questions left not answered. Characters not developed. More on why the forest needed protection.	0
12851	A2F0MIJA0O5PW8	sorry - lost interest very quickly. grossly shallow and unrealistic story. we all want a bit of romance and fluff, but this is so way out.	0
12852	A14QSBQKADIRGO	Tried to get into it, just couldn't. Errors and just not an attention grabber. Have to write four more words.	1
12853	A1OB6OAQ2WK5VH	Not so much.  This was more a tale of strangeness rather then a tale of vampires.  Didn't really enjoy this one so much.	1
12854	A29WRHY05JWWAK	I don't like the idea of what you can do while in prison and the fact that they got away with it.	1
12855	A1ZRNZZNB3W1YL	I gave up on this story which is something I never do but I just was not intrigued by the storyline.	0
12856	A165JY8H5LURGM	Made mistake with this one. Too short, strange subject matter, can't be removed from kindle history. Unfortunately the story wasn't written very well.	0
12857	A3GBOAHVE4XJNX	I  almost passed this by, I wish I had. How many books can be a new twist on an old doll story?	1
12858	A47GGCEA6JMUD	Was expecting a longer book.  It is only a fee pages, maybe a dozen.  Good story but too short and fast.  Left out time for real details	0
12859	A3AZYX1V7F5ABM	pictures in this book could have possibly made it better.  ideas would have been conveyed much better.  next time I would pass	1
12860	A1412AJQLEIIAW	I sent it back when I got to the part where the hero, Cole, pushed his young sidekick into a brothel relationship. Not a book for me!	1
12861	A21JYMBV8SOJC8	Worst book ever read. No story line to speak of, felt like I wasted my money..go back to the drawing board with this one.	0
12862	A3LI194S8AIM03	Sex scenes descriptive , but the writing is just plain bad...sometimes short and sweet needs to include Short, Sweet and Good. It's a shame because the plot wasn't half bad.	1
12863	A203ZIQX0HOEGJ	Half way through the book I gave up. This book was just that boring to me. I would not wast my time on it.	0
12864	AKJ9OZUSZUFIL	You can get this much over the phone or at the library plus you get the benefit of personal contact.	0
12865	AHEDJFS7R3EA7	I hate giving bad reviews, but I didn't like this at all. I had to force myself to finish it	0
12866	A3FY5VVYJAKX3U	Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring! Well the shot was all over the place the plots wad weak up no sex no action no real drama.	1
12867	ATEDE2VOPG6PA	I swear a twelve year old wrote this. It was nothing to it. It was so bad I swear gosh	0
12868	AE6NS315DVHWY	A bit of a &#34;nothing&#34; book. Very predictable. Not very coherently written.The cover and words give the impression of quite a different story.	1
12869	A222RDCFF1WCUE	I didn't like this book at all. It had no parts of erotica in it and it spent way too much time with her mental rambling and mousy meekness!	0
12870	A1LF6JD8UEQA7Q	This is just a rehash of a lot of old jokes. Some are taken from Henny Youngman, Rodney Dangerfield etc but they are not credited. Thumbs down.	0
12871	A2O8PHRDGBW1NI	Enjoyed this story but it tended to jump around a little bit which was a tad confusing! Do want to find out what happened?!	1
12872	AABXUSGGXUY1Q	The same story over and over again. Told different ways. Certainly not what I expected. Tacky and lame. What a waste of time.	0
12873	A3V1PYL2CPXNKB	But a little clumsy. Betrays an undeveloped understanding of the world. Will get better the more she writes. May be your cup of tea.	1
12874	A3SC4X9EG92FNV	It was a great story.  Loved the characters, hopefully you will go into them in the other books.  But the typos drove me crazy.	1
12875	A2YCHSR2LELR6P	This book is very slow moving for a Sci-Fi story. A lot more action could be taking place as the main plot hasn't even really developed by chapter 12.	1
12876	A3CY0KMJVYPQMU	At first I liked this author's attempts at humor but as the book went on it got goofier and goofier and I couldn't read any more.	1
12877	A1O2MZTHAQ22I0	I never finished reading the book I lost interest in it. it kinda kept repeating it self. find a better  book.	1
12878	AXOSYBUPHQWRZ	It's sad that vulgar romance novelists list their work as Science Fiction to trick readers into purchasing it. Please Amazon, place more control on how a book may be listed.	0
12879	A3SK6BTH6X3EI3	"Free read, so I should not complain as I am usually a fan of a quick and dirty read. It was dirty, but a little too ""quick"" for me."	1
12880	AUONFFCRVO998	Sorry but there is only one shift in the whole book. And the sex between the 2 main characters takes up the whole book. Where's the story?	1
12881	AXN99ZP1ZZF68	Not crazy about this. I have read better and the scene wasn't good enough for such a short story. Oh well. Better luck next time.	1
12882	ADIAXS54A263Z	Not for beginners. There were no instructions with pictures.	0
12883	AAX5H56252DMR	Don't waste your time.  This is nit one of his best.  I was not at all challenged by the story.	1
12884	A2OPH5WCKZMR53	don't waste your time or money on this one.  You could just google this stuff.  Didn't even bother reading after flipping through it.	0
12885	A2HSWKFP2U1PU0	Another L.Ron Hubbard style cult writing.  Save yourself the time and just get outside and experience nature and be kind to people.	0
12886	A3HIUIVIZCE01M	Did not even finish the book. I was Bored to death!!!!! Off to get a nap.... I got sleepy...Yawns!	0
12887	A2SBBMXYNC81V6	I did not finish it. From what I remember of the plot, it made little sense from the get go.	0

12889	A23TXD0C5CX6IM	No colors, not crazy about the story, but it keeps the kids entertained and happy. Im going to have to research books for a kindle that is pre kindle fire	1
12890	A18V6IN87VHYL6	I didn't like the Theme of the story.  All I can say is that I didn't like the book.  Thank you!	1
12891	A255TOW74IKRE	Books started out good. Lots of hilarious banter between Ali and her best friend. Just book got weird for me towards the end. Didn't end like I thought it would.	1
12892	AKWBRE0JKA2A1	Had to read certain passages twice--typos.  Wish there had been more on how they built up to a relationship.  I felt no chemistry between these two.	1
12893	A35PU678B73IHI	As well intentioned as this book might be,it contains very little news as to the treatment of diabetes.Thank You for your efforts but give us a little more next time,Jay.	0
12894	A20F2WQGGNTILV	I bought this book based on the reviews. People seemed to like it(I don't understand why)This is not a believable story line. No story build up and Badly written.	0
12895	A26Y96G1L0D6UH	It was ok reading. It was not smooth transitioning from one scene to the next. I still enjoyed reading the book.	1
12896	A1BQWDIEOZN3W9	Hope there is someway to get this off of my purchase history.  I did not like the book at all.  Too smutty for my taste.	0
12897	A3N80BBIVW31QP	This story was not very interesting. I wish the author would have made this story more interesting. This was the first time  I ever read a book like this.	0
12898	A3TFAKO8HX82A5	Well, I started reading this book and only continued to find out who did it.  I found it a tedious read at best.	1
12899	A3AY8E8L456T1K	Not what I was expecting in this story, as the story was two men. The story was sweet overall though.	0
12900	A1WQ79SX01W3PS	The editing was horrible and the stories were boring and didn't read well.... it didn't have the umph i was looking for	0
12901	A9R3B0KHAMFCA	This is the first book in the series. A prequel is required. There is a whole nuther story to tell.  That would make this story worth actually reading.	1
12902	AUGPI152KATTR	Ok read, this book has nothing to do with rodeos. Author is very overly descriptive, and there was little happy in this book.	1
12903	A43YKXX0K9Y42	I read this story with my grandson and found it was very hard to get into the story. We only read half the book before choosing something else.	1
12904	AQLETMRNSI3N8	Typical short to the point storyline, meet, sex, dream, ever after. Physique captured me again. Love a mans body. So ok.	1
12905	AGLMUVRBOAM24	She chose LUKE????  (havent read this one)SOMEONE TELL ME EVERYONE IS KIDDING.  IM TOO YOUNG FOR THIS TO HAPPEN!WHY KIRA!	0
12906	A1KI5GFS2FB97Z	It was slow and the subject matter was not to my liking and I didn't find this out until I was a quarter of the way into the book.	1
12907	A2235VVLLAYD31	Very unrealistic and puerile. Just so fantastic as to be unbelievable.  No depth. So not interested in reading the next in the series.	0
12908	A1TAWVMUUE1BV0	"Story started out ok then got really bizarre and too ""graphic"" for me - didn't even finish it. Would not recommend purchase."	0
12909	AFD4C1I927BAW	Story got too wordy at times.  Hard to see when the little girl was cleaning her room.  But my child liked it	1
12910	A2Q571PVNCZN62	It's thriller but action is to slowly for this kind of book.Reading was no emotional, only facts without any excitation.	1
12911	A9KI9TQ6JRN09	I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. NO DOUBT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD STORY BUT IN MY OPINION NOT VERY WELL CRAFTED	0
12912	A16PKYU9671OTT	The story line was very good, but the conversational pieces made me grit my teeth.  I also could not find anything about the author on the internet.	1
12913	A3UCQ3MT3S5J30	It seemed like the writing was very choppy and not smooth and flowing. There was also A LOT of swearing which is not my cup of tea.	1
12914	AK5ETIYOJ5QPI	"Not erotic, definitely not amazing. This collection of ""stories"" is truly terrible. Don't waste your time even if it's free."	0
12915	A1622QQ5BXBKLR	I don't know any thing about this, bet the boyfriend got this too and also probably has not read this one because impulse.	1
12916	A3TJL6EEPTDBAH	Seemed to be a bad term paper to me, lots of reference books. Also interviews with subjects written poorly and confusing.	0
12917	A22CLGQ2Z8L7ND	This story was steamy enough, I just had a problem with the fact that he pretty much forced her to have sex with him.  Not into that.	1
12918	A1HTSJ72VI8XA6	This book has alot of very agressive sex scences in it that will get your blood pressure rising but there isn't much of a story to go along with it.	1
12919	A1S6KXGOPDY16M	Frankly was expecting more based on glowing reviews. A simplistic overview of Evernote not much beyond the embedded help file in the program. A 7 minute read.	1
12920	A2BHEPYIDR182L	I wanted this to be better then it was. It was not. I could not get into it. Should have been written better.	0
12921	A133UF3YWVVUH1	This book was kinda random, like really random thoughts that only my cousin would think about!!!!! It was ok I guess......long, very long.I didn't expect it to be that long!!!!!!	1
12922	A2HK4RZBG0KC71	"A bit hard to read for an ""easy reader"" book. Characters are cute and the story is age appropriate. 2 stars."	1
12923	A1WVJ0XNKZR0Y3	It is well researched, well written, well paced.  At least until 3/4 of the way.  And then...you lost me.  And let's not even talk about the ending.	1
12924	A1C09AU5GF0MRP	This is the dullest, most verbose novel filled with mindless chit chat and sparse action. What a disappointment! I could care less about what they eat, etc.	0
12925	A2S8E2XN241T8O	In my opinion not for anyone who only drinks non alcoholic stuff and is over the age of maybe twenty. I made it to the 3%  mark with great effort.	0
12926	A2QRATIUDJHYDL	Didn't much care for this novel, seemed a little unbelievable/unrealistic. Neither am I into names like Snowflake! Probably won't buy more t. l. peters books.	1
12927	A2UJTG9XC4KISL	Ridiculous story, not a lot to it at all, some of the happenings are like really you think that would happen!  NOT	0
12928	A39JEFQ7TVFGLO	Not quite as funny as I had anticipated.  Great picture on the cover--who doesn't like Groucho glasses?!  As for the book itself, well, that's another story.  Of course, YMMV.	1
12929	AB4V97ANL9BMX	As an Elvis fan I was slightly insulted with the way Elvis' memory was handled.  And the plot development was thin.	1
12930	A28REJAM6899K8	Thought this could have had a little more spice. May be another set for the weird neighbor and his pleasure.	1
12931	A28REJAM6899K8	Not quite what I expected. The sexual scene was interesting. Maybe my next read will get better. Carry on with the reading. On to the next book or short story.	1
12932	A2FGWF9T3D0RJI	It started okay but left me dry and uncaring of any of what happened to the characters. Even the sexual scenes were not pleasing.	1
12933	A2OUV3FTK3UDV5	There was too much sex and not enough story to go around. I am not a prude but I like more involvement in the narrative other than nudity!	0
12934	AF3Q2X8LGGPZC	All these books are the starting books of series, so you aren't able to finish a story line. Very disappointing collection.	0
12935	A5B8GBI93HAH9	Loopy main characters. One of the few books that I have started but neverfinished. The good part is that I will avoid the author in the future.	0
12936	A34W7FMC550OX6	Use your imagination and have fun making smoothies -- nothing here that I hadn't thought of - not sure why I bought it.	1
12937	A28JCMU4AAP3DE	this book was gearing up to be an awesome book, and just abruptly ended. really diappointed. glad it was a free book	1
12938	A3OF9QTH843WL3	This is a fanciful account of the the relationship between the sisters which ended in their estrangement.  There is no factual evidence for the theory.	1
12939	A2FBWJ28RIBA07	I really did not like this book. It would more likely appeal to other persons, It was not a romance  but basically porn.	0
12940	A35FMAMHVGYJ4Q	If there was more build up between the couple instead of having them fall in love so quickly, this story could have been a better read. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish.	1
12941	A3TXQTLMLTSD8G	I thought this book would for y daughter but it was a little to mature for her. I guess if she was older it would have been a good read	1
12942	A13X5H28S22055	I WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A LESBIAN BOOK.MAYB AMAZON SHOULD WRITE A BETTER REVIEW.THIS BOOK SOUNDS LIKE A MAN DREAM ABOUT 2 WOMEN. WASTE OF MY TIME.DIDNOT FINISH	0
12943	AE8STY1FYA73M	Fleming's story was showing great promise but left me looking for the substance.  Funny  I,could,put it down. Reading is one of my pleasures but not this one.	1
12944	A2547RR0GQTRAF	Horrible. I read to chapter 3 praying for it to take off but it never did. Too wordy, too boring, and it wasn't delivered well.	0
12945	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	Couldn't get through it had to give up.	1
12946	APZQ0O7NGJYGU	I could not get into this book. did not care at all for this book.  Don't know what else to tell you.	0
12947	A1W5OZJ9IJTZ6C	I believe a book with this much graphic information and a few choice words should not be considered christian. True christianity needs to be shown to others.	0
12948	AFJOPJTYTKA1X	The picture sold me.  The price was good....free.  But, honestly I don't even remember reading this one, although I know I did once I re-read the preview.  Can't recommend it.	1
12949	A3VD4PLV020VVT	These stories just seem more like something penned by Joe Hill than Stephen King. In any case the stories are way to short for the price.	1
12950	A20HZP3DSR4FWP	The plot/ storyline of this book had potential. However, the constant occurrence of grammatical errors made this a very hard book to finish. It doesn't flow well at all.	1
12951	A37UHCXSW373QL	i read a lot of contemporary romance but this was just a bad plot and idiotic hero...can i getba refund?	0
12952	A3L8XRYMLZZES6	Total waste of money, this book is roughly 7 pages. It is a total rip off and scam. They should tell you .	0
12953	A3IVSZ06K8XFLP	The history was very good. It was just really long and very dry to read. Very difficult to hold my attention.	1
12954	ABI1V8YHNUK87	Just not a good book, poorly written, the characters are not all that likeable.  If you have nothing better to do and nothing better to read go for it.	1
12955	A17J3U3XOZ5A4B	I did not really make it past the second page in this book.  It didn't really capture my interest at all.	0
12956	A199LWM6G9H66J	The characters were very likable,  but the lack of passion I found boring.  I enjoy spice with my romance novels.	1
12957	A1LIS1DJXN2P7C	A typical King James version of the bible that is not always the easiest to read or follow.  A contemporary bible is simplier to read and understand.	1
12958	A2DK02WGRTXLUT	This was it log rough to understand or review.  I must not have gotten the whole book downloaded.  This sucks.	0
12959	AU5K7SFSRXRSR	It was ok. The book was ok if u have nothing else to do, but otherwise, I wouldn't buy it.	1
12960	A61TPF208Q1K6	Logan wasn't dominant, he was angry.  He had angry, vanilla sex.  Nothing intimate, hot, erotic or loving about it whatsoever.	0
12961	A15QN7G31SX0GR	Shame on this person (not author) for tricking people into buying a &#34;book&#34; that is just a commercial for a product that they don't need!	0
12962	A2A8DFY2Y6T1PA	This did not float my boat.  I felt like I got cheated in even paying 99 cents for this on sale.	1
12963	A3B23A2UL9AUOF	I must have missed something.  Did I miss the rest of the story? That can't be all there is.  A great start now how to I get the rest?	1
12964	A3442IFWD5E846	Couldn't finish this. Too predictable and poorly written.  I chose this art because I liked Adrian's other work. This just doesn't measure up	1
12965	A1ESF76N9NLS0P	This book is good for when common sense isn't enough.  Advice your mother could have given you.  You dont need this book to quit job.  2 stars	1
12966	A39BYL5999T3B0	It was like this girl was as accident probe as this book was stupid.  I won't waste anymore time finishing this book.	0
12967	A1QY6FR83J9XZB	This is a very rushed writing job and not up to great  story telling that the author is capable of. Very disappointing and not worth it.	1
12968	A2EI9JWVQLW6RI	2 stars 98% of the jokes in this book were horrible but it was free so I got it if you like dumb jokes this book is for you.	1
12969	A26TJBR4D1NIQ	Grimm Prequels volumes 1-6, I found myself struggling to get through each installment. I wanted to love these, unfortunately I did not.	0

12971	A27YS469HC6N1F	I do not recommend this book. It was a quick read, but definitely one of the worse ones I've read.	0
12972	A37Y8UMHP27L4Q	Wasn't what I thought it was. You have to purchase it in order to get the magazine. It's not free like it says	0
12973	AF7L7JWSRS122	I really didn't like this book at all thought I could get a better understanding if I read the whole boom but it still was not interesting	1
12974	A408A5WB9475J	A mixture of gothic horror story and clownish satire, but not as well mixed as to make it pleasant reading. It might have been...but never reached this goal!	1
12975	AZRUSF6F1WL0N	Too similar to 50 Shades. Didn't even get very far before I lost interest and thought it was just eh.	0
12976	A1MUXEU3VW00UE	This last part seemed rushed!! Good ending but nothing jaw dropping happened in this part and was not expecting that!	1
12977	A3RVRQ2CENY9BC	A lot of the ingredients are things that are out of my budget or out of my diet.  I will try a couple of them though.	1
12978	AXQJX29D9648D	They had a few twist and turns that were interesting but language was a huge factor for me. It was pretty bad.	1
12979	A37KZ9VE383UQZ	This book was ok . But I would not read it again. The beginning was good,So was the ending. Everything else not so much.	1
12980	ASYO81C3PZ1N9	It wasn't what I was looking for, and it was a very short direct girl on girl book.  I should have read a preview before downloading.	0
12981	A3C94VGWAUBW6V	Short and no plot. So glad it was free, I won't be reading the other books. Porn in written form.	0
12982	A3NRFX1Z78TQNZ	I ordered the book because of my interest in Buddhism. This reading didn't provide the teaching I thought it would have.	1
12983	AWQ0H0LL6FRTW	Not great. Should have gone straight to the video.  Could not see the words no matter how I turned the kindle.	0
12984	AKC6F3CYQKBG	Read until I could not keep reading. I was waiting for something to happen and grasp my interest but it just didn't. Very disappointed .	0
12985	A2KFG7MKA5YNS4	I would like a bit more story than this. It just made it so cheap sounding even though they got to know each other before having sex. It was rushed.	1
12986	A9LAPV8XNKZVZ	half a story. Must have had an idea and changed his mind. The talent shows, the effort does not. Have you no shame, sir?	0
12987	A2ED4C0QQV6LCA	THIS BOOK GOES FROM BORING TO EXTREMELY BORING. HOPE I CAN REMEMBER THE AUTHER SO I DO NOT GET ANOTHER ONE OF THE AUTHER'S LITTLE JEMS.	1
12988	ABLPE5T3VCCQ5	I wish I would have looked at the reviews a little closer before getting this one!  Finished it by skimming which made it tolerable.	0
12989	A32PX453MXWTL2	No characterization. Bad punctuation. Little or no intent of normal conversation from characters. I won't buy any other books by this person.Freddie Forte	0
12990	A3B8NBK1HF953R	I would recommend if they have the whole series in one book to buy that. This is very short and not much to read.	1
12991	A2AI4R4JQ6Q772	2stars for an all to short story that sounded to much like many others I have read. I wish she could have continued and Developed the plot more fully.	1
12992	A3FZ5R9XQC9JIV	it just felt like a rough draft of an idea that was doodled on a napkin while waiting for a dinner date with an aquaintence to discuss insurance.  not impressed	1
12993	A8BW9KGCIKPG0	Most of the book was talking about how bad blonds are. But some of them was funny and some are not. Horriblw book!?#	0
12994	A1YGWBMC8SDJVX	...or even if u are...all of this series are moronic..BAD. Simplistic... very juvenile writing. No redeeming features at all.	0
12995	A3FVAHYWXWHWG	This is deceptively like someone gave me the first 3 chapters of a book to tease me into more.  I dislike deception.	1
12996	A1J0CB2ZMZK13O	Seriously not worth my time. I was lured in by the cover, but was disappointed by what wasn't there after.	0
12997	A3HBUORS8GLI4G	Could not get into this book. No excitement to want me to continue reading.  I could predict where the storyline was going.	0
12998	AS6AIXR0EGXMB	It's an okay book. I just couldn't get into it. I hate leaving a bad review but it was just too far fetched for me.	0
12999	AC7C2EWX2I9EX	I started to read this 'book'.  It turned out to be a 'chapter, instead of a book.  Lots of sex verbage but no buy-in for the main characters.	1
13000	A3G62MZBBRDQXZ	Not sure why it said adult version, nothing adult about it. Glad I didn't pay for it. Boring but at least it was over quick.	0
13001	A1JFKURTROWE5H	It seems sort of silly and I can't get into the story.  I didn't read the entire book.  I love James Patterson but just not this book.	1
13002	A350Y4L5YNOUDP	this book was awful very long dull and boring there was nothing but rape and cruelty i read the end and it was stupid very unbelievable.	0
13003	AX3W2FJYMPWZQ	these three books should have been combined. i felt like the separation was a ruse to get me to spend more money.	1
13004	AL62PMRZ0KDLV	Not much to say about this book other than I didn't like it. Would not refer any of my friends to purchase!	1
13005	A368JQF64HIVQ1	It was like watching &#34;Sex & the City 363423&#34;. Completely fake and glossy.	1

13007	A2E6BLX2V50ZPS	I have tried to read this book but it has not caught my attention I keep drifting off. I will try to read it again but I just don't know.	0
13008	A2JYBNXB2UFSO0	Too many words misspelled and grammar problems. It kept me from enjoying the book. Characters seem unbelievable in some cases.	1
13009	A3U3DICM8NYHU2	Should have been much longer. Shame it was not to not to bad at all....such a disappointment...read in like 20 mins	1
13010	AGWRWNMG7O0CQ	Boring, a little.  Really slow but I do like their quirky, semi-sexy interactions.  Love Rafael's mom.	1
13011	AF3E59VMPKTMW	"Thought that this would be more illuminating about the antique trade and instead got page after page of dull  ""adventures"" of a stuffy college student."	1
13012	A2R1TNO2KV5EUV	I really need to lay off the romance novel.  Too much vulgarity in my opinion.  But the storyline was decent.	1
13013	A12N2RH120Q43B	This is story in search of a tale. It failed in its quest. It looked at first to be spinning an interesting yarn. It didn't.	0
13014	A31X23DF54XV3B	Very short. And the whole beginning is just filler. There is no real story at all. Basically just a bunch of nonsense with a sex scene. Then the end.	1

13016	A29GF1ZIH5BJIA	Badly written and very obvious story.  I am surprise with all the good reviews it got. Don't waste you money.	0
13017	ARLNXYSD8GA2S	I thought this would have recipes and fun activities to do with kids i the microwave. I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I skimmed through then deleted it.	0
13018	A3KWLE7H7QYUOJ	i think this is probably a old true crime magazine article which wasdoctored up to take advantage of e-book market. it interesting but the priceis high for what you get.	1
13019	A1S5J5P8Y6YSOV	I liked the story but it was to short. I wish it was longer. I liked how they met and how he calms her. Just wish it was longer.	1
13020	A3NW9Y963QZ8WI	the first quarter was really interesting, then it got loooooong and so angst-ridden.  i couldnt seem to get emotionally involved with the characters.	1
13021	A1TGR96XC9OG7E	I was so ready for this to be really good...unfortunately it was just ok...not as dark as some other reviews led me to believe	1
13022	A1PH0SIPRL5J5Z	I couldn't finish the book. I kept running into these editing issues and it was just too difficult for me to keep reading. So I gave up.	0
13023	AZK0JQBXIH2MJ	Poorly written and chaotic.  Created no real bond between characters.  Plot was all over the place.  Won't quickly buy this author again.	0
13024	A1KCDJRDFZT26B	This is a really offensive book.  After reading 2-3 pages, I returned it.  It is not true to Regency conventions, the language is vulgar, it's plain porn.	0
13025	A315PZT2HV4R9J	The story drags and is odd for shock value as opposed to purpose. Don't bother, its a weird rip off of Hansel and Gretel.	0
13026	AUTXEVTOZT2RM	I just don't get it's to close to bestiality for my taste. I guess I need him to have more of a personality	1
13027	AFHUQMR769QGW	A very short story, a bit too short actually.  Not enough details, feels like the story is just left hanging.	1
13028	A2KHEWJ5INQEL1	I am not a fan of Zane's anyhow, but this book could not have been more boring.  It was short, yet still hard to finish.	0
13029	A4U0QTR71IEGY	I didn't think it was amazing or anything...I felt it could have been a LOT better and it wasn't very interesting. In truth I was disappointed this book	1
13030	A2AJUQCBACY31J	the story was entertaining but too predictable as to what the outcome would be. easy read and someone may enjoy it for the entertainment value	1
13031	A3AP5XDIPXOK9W	I read all James Patterson books and usually can't lay them down.  I have to say I can't into this series!!  Not impressed at all.  I wouldn't buy it.	0
13032	A4SI7Z4XOTI2	THE STORY WASN'T WELL THOUGHT OUT,THE MONSTER WAS WAY OVER THE TOP......	0
13033	ARL2OGQDVPVKE	Thank God this was just a sampler because I wouldn't be able to actually read the whole thing and that is sad 'cause I really wanted to like this.	1

13036	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Two stars for being too short only.  A different take on a fairy tale that uses original story as a point of interest.	1
13037	A1B4I7MHW9DX21	This was a short erotic novel. The premise sounded good but I just couldn't get into it. Not bad for a free book though.	1
13038	ADU1OGV7GG3S6	This book details hardships traveling overland to the Washington/Oregon area by river and wagon travelIn year 1836,  Good read.	1
13039	A3R25LAPU1WXIQ	Do not like!  Disjointed. Unbelievable. Too trite. God is no namby pamby panty waist.Giving this book two stars is being generous.	1
13040	A165ZFBYAHWO52	I read a little bit of it but it never captured my attention so I deleted it off of my kindle.	1
13041	A3CUWRVAKGEFHL	This book was a bit too weird for me. I much prefer crime mystery thrillers and this story was different.	0
13042	A7LD1TK5M7VAS	If these characters had a little more life to them and the story a little more meat it could have been a great horror or thriller.	1
13043	AJ6NMC9P07O5S	It was boring and the romance was nonexistent. Story was more about everyone else than Layne and Jessica. Not worth $3.99	0
13044	A1ZPYD01GM7NK	This just didn't do it for me.  It seemed bland and contrived and a waste of time.  I wasn't disappointed at the end, because I never cared for the story.	1
13045	A1VOPES1YZVL3X	This game is not for the Kindle Fire!  Also I can't purchase it on my Canadian Credit Card, thereby, no sale!!	1
13046	A3RF010MX29BQP	I made the blueberry muffins and I have to say they were not good.  This made me reluctant to try any of the others.	1
13047	A2NN1T9YXW5Y0M	This information could be easily gleaned from any web search. Badly written. A waste of my time, even for a free download.	1
13048	A2JSPG3WLAILRS	Rori is a b!#. I refuse to believe people still think like that....I hate to think about Mike and Rori married life, or how their children will turn out...	0
13049	A2KBMRHLZ6O7V8	Not worth the time or effort.  Cliches abound in the characters and storyline.  I didn't even go past chapter three.	1
13050	ADZPIG9QOCDG5	Short story but not a lot of story depth and too much sexual content for the length of story.  Guess it just wasn't my cup of tea.	0
13051	A1GM07OY3OPI6C	I found the story slow.  I have not finished it. I could not not get into the characters.  It was difficult.	1
13052	A48PQUV156KMQ	I like Nikki's novels in general but this one was not consensual and not for me.  I still like her other novels.	1
13053	A211ERR1J3UW8K	I found the writing had no life, no excitement, pass on this one.The plot has potential - but there's little drama.	1
13054	A39WB9644KI1T0	But nothing specially interesting or relevant. Not gritty, not noir, no particulaly interesting plots or characters.Once read you sense time could have been better spent.	1
13055	A3PUASO90IEW8U	It took me 12 minutes to read. Nothing else to say about this book, except that it should be free!	0
13056	A3KOYLDZEXUPMH	Not very good at all not even for a short story. Couldn't really believe the things that were said won't read the next one	1
13057	A22BZ8XZQKVHOI	I could not stand the vulgar language and I stopped probably 5 minutes into the book. No further comment at this moment.	0
13058	A2DF5TPZQCNMFW	I expected a little more more information for .99 cents. I get he was promoting his other book but really? I felt like a read three sentences!	1
13059	A280EBTOBXQAUQ	This book is a complete waste of anyone's time. The publisher should be ashamed its in &#34;print&#34;. Awful and stupid.	0
13060	A1UNQ523GW6RE1	I didn't read more than a few pages, found it not worth my time. 6 more words required to say skip it.	1
13061	A2VTHX59CH6HN7	This book was okay, but it was definitely not the funniest dog book. It is pretty cute though!!! I recommend it for younger kids:)	1
13062	A19BQ2FXJ5CCOH	very childish read. Thought was written by a child by the way it was protrayed. but know thats not the case. Do not recomend!	0
13063	A39TY6P1V76LKL	Badly written.  Wrong word choices.  Missing words.  Awkward writing.  I'm a high school student and this is terrible.  Not worth reading even if free.	0
13064	A3FA0RACII84DP	If you are young and inexperienced, this is a good help.  If you have been a Mom and housewife for a few years not very helpful at all.	1
13065	A14RPXUQSES4AM	I generally like to complete reading of any books I get but this was not interesting to me.I had to delete after three chapters, I don't care who did it!	1
13066	A3BEEZNJPVWFOF	All over the place and I could not really get in the story. Yes I followed the plot and yadah yadah but I couldn't get into the story.	0
13067	A1QM6MUVNRE7JE	It was too short. It was boring too! I think you should not get this book if you love exciting books like me!!!	0
13068	A3UPIR39YVIDT1	The story had a good beginning. Just when I was getting into the story, it ended!  Wish it was a longer story! The story has good possibilities.	1
13069	A2WJSBJ8XGFOYQ	This book isn't bad.  Its an intro, and it made me immediately go out and buy the 2nd book, which was horrible in my opinion.	0
13070	A89LBLNSNZI26	After reading previous reviews, I was excited to read this story but was very disappointed.. Story never really grabbed me and I guess I finish just to finish.	1
13071	A1CPJD87PMPJQJ	I can't say why I even bought this book as it was 99Cents. I really need to read reviews before I buy	0
13072	AUH5N8V1XHXC2	The female character annoyed me so I didn't finish it. Not worth finishing. Wish I hadn't got it. On to the next.	1
13073	A24G4PIYR0FQBK	the book if you can call it that was to short. I see why it was free and very disappointing.	0
13074	AYXJI61XZP5GI	Very poorly written, I no it's fiction but any reference to history has been poorly researched, agin the book is made up of character description which kills the story line	1
13075	AAYTGCWCP8DRG	The story line Jumps around. Stupid. If I could choose 0 stars I would. Gave up and deleted this one.	0
13076	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	Not a bad book, but not a good book either. Poorly edited, and a very abrupt ending. I won't be reading anything by this author again.	1
13077	A1L6EMVO8SNSED	Probably the worse series I have read. It never really goes any where except maybe from bad to worse, a waste of time to read.	0
13078	A2NIHC9T7FAMGK	WOW. I actually got depressed reading this novel but yet it was intense and addicting to read. I honestly don't know if I would recommend it to anyone or not.	1
13079	A1XSGKY5HTU4U	Where is the rest of it.  This was supposed to be a book not an excerpt of one.  Not happy.	0
13080	A13SSJLEP22WH2	I did not like to this and thought it was very tasteful. I would not read again no story line.	0
13081	A1E0DZM175VGHI	This book is not what I expected for a book of quotes. I do not care for it at all.	1
13082	A2CJRU4KQ8WRC	Needs revisions and better edited. Way too long and tedious. Also fish breathe air not water, thats why they have gills.	1
13083	A30V9M9DZW8SFU	total waste of time. if I read the first book first I would have never wasted the time to get this.DELETE	0
13084	AVKEWDXFYLB7I	Just was not my thing...someone else might give it a five. but it was a quick read, and writing was clear, concise, quick	0
13085	A2UH7EMPH4GK2L	The description of this book sounded intriguing, but I have to admit that I was lost. The author's writing style was confusing, and I gave up shortly into the book.	0
13086	A55OKZL0BR4BK	I haven't finished reading this yet, but I'm a little disappointed!!  I thought this was going to be a page turner but it's not.	1
13087	AFG1HBKPFAG5S	Forget this one.  Unfortunately there is zero character development, zero story and nothing of substance except lots of sex, none of which is very erotic by the way.	0
13088	A1H4TU6SM9TVJR	I read 9 chapters and fell asleep!  Could  not keep  my attention at all.  What a waist of time.Joanna, Tx.	0
13089	A2AK2U6WTC0MK7	I really didn't like this book, I started losing interest in this book after awhile. Didn't keep me on edge.	1
13090	A2H6SOO305GDGU	This was just a silly story.  The best thing about it was that it is short.  Don't waste your money...get it if it is free.	0
13091	A3W6IYKH31V5N	Painful....kept  reading, hoping to find even ONE good story while stuck on a plane ride...no such luck......not sure why these were ever published.	0
13092	A12Z0IYZWWKCS5	way too many typos and too disjointed.  really, does a girl do that and still think she is a nice girl??just not even a good sex description.	0
13093	A15EXAOGJJOK3H	Was psyched that I had found a book I really thought I was going to enjoy....disappointed when it turned into Fifty Shades in Wonderland :(	1
13094	A1VOIJG44KZ4ST	Tycoon(?) says&#34;no strings&#34; but spends too much time trying to get her in the sack! She's a stupid woman. I would've taken the money & run! Really, don't bother.	1
13095	A958HWE7A12HA	While having read the teaser, I expected more. It was quite a flat read. I had really hoped for something more.	1
13096	A2LXICKJ62RUOL	Im just dispontied that she was having sex with a guy who have sex with other women in her group	0
13097	A2FE7W89ZLM6VP	Book was to short. Could of had more to the story. Could of had more interesting things to happen to want you to read more but it did not.	1
13098	ACRQH63K8Z6RU	I my opinion this story was rushed.  There was no proper developement.  I did not like it and would not recommend it to a friend.	0
13099	A2X9BIRSJHFU5W	I did not like the way the story was laid out and the references implied in this book. So my rating is low.	0
13100	AM7OZJUTC3L7P	the book is a little hard to follow and I am having a tough time staying interested enough to finish it,	1
13101	A3RQDA03SY3A20	Most people give a clear ending. There was none and I wanted muchMoreAndBetter story to show an end	1
13102	AKQ1JXCPBDDDU	I deleted this quickly.  I did not make it very far through before I was bored and took it off my list.	0
13103	A1QJDDPFGG3762	I loved it just wish the story was much longer in order for Selena to gain some confidence but other than that it was great.	0
13104	A10O39TIDNC2JA	This book has the potential to be good ,though short the characters are likable. Only gave it two stars because besides kissing not much is going on	1
13105	A2MOOT2TPBDSZZ	Awful storyline and characters. Not worth the time! I even deleted it from my Kindle. Unforunately, the idea was great, but never fully developed as far as I'm concerned.	0
13106	A3AD1F8H0I6AB6	This book isn't great.  I suggest buying the first book to see is you like it before buying trilogy.  It lacked depth and character development.  There are grammar mistakes.	0
13107	A222WQ9VGVPSR5	This was alright, kind of boring but not a bad story at all for as short as it was. I couldn't see it being a longer story though.	1
13108	A18800IOKMBNNW	dome interesting twists and turns but the too blunt writing style kept jerking me out of the moment. The evil mother is not terribly believable.	1
13109	A2FBVXS27USYDU	The jokes were boring and stupid. BUT some jokes did make me laugh. So if you are into kiddy jokes this book is for you.	0
13110	A1OKK00QXX9HFR	"I am all about reading ""fun"" fiction for an escape but there is really nothing fun about this one.  Who really sends their wife into these situations.  Overall disappointing read."	1
13111	A1IIPL5A3UCIXQ	Endless chatter.  Unresolved plot points.  Not remotely entertaining.  The rambling narrative was annoying and served no purpose other than to make it a challenge to finish the story.	0
13112	A2F75O1Y9702R1	I bought this by mistake. Not the Wallbanger I was looking for!!!I guess you can't judge a book by its cover!!!	0
13113	A9R3B0KHAMFCA	Red better. This it turning out to be a long drawn out saga. I don't know if I'll read the next story.	1
13114	A3H562YGOWSDI	This book was a let down.  I cannot understand why the story was written so poorly.  This was not an arrangement of love.	1
13115	AUQTJCZH5XOKB	Following these stories was confusing and way to disjointed. Couldn't follow the stories at all. Did try to make it through all three gave up just wasn't worth it	0
13116	A1HMWW7JXLWHJY	This was not a good choice for me.  I did not like the book at all and actually put it down before I finished it.	0
13117	A6KKRKXMNHCDW	Thomas was a little to quick to claim Cat and be accepting of who she is. They are a cute couple but wish it was not so rushed	1
13118	A2QCM7USXLIO7P	Who the neck is the Duke and what is the reason for his having such prominence in the story. Actually I scanned more than I read.	1
13119	A1XJ8BRL29EO9S	Not for me. This is a quick read that turns classic reads into jokes. I love a good laugh but this book didn't do it for me.	1
13120	A2WOCJZ8STFHDW	Forgettable.  A bit too light in the characterization and plot - enough so that even a few days after reading it I really can't recall a lot about it.	1
13121	AX2G9SEMQWGPG	I didn't find anything useful in this book that the average person doesn't already know. Save your money and use it at someone's sale.	1
13122	A3PWR8RQEMTTXJ	Got this free for my Kindle. Good thing. 'Cause if I paid money for it, I'd be angry that I'd wasted it. Couldn't get past the second chapter. Sorry.	0
13123	AWV3GYEDL91R2	I didn't make through this one - it wasn't what I thought when I picked it. What I did read had some humor.	1
13124	A29NTGB8MOGW36	What can I say? This was juvenile, amateurish, derivative on every level, clumsy etc. Complete waste of the writer's as well as the reader's time.	0
13125	A2JTVE8NWW2X80	It could have been a good book, but it's just like the writer ran out of interesting storyline and just wrote a lot of fill.	1
13126	A15NZD5WINDQZM	i think suspense means you should be wondering who did it?  i found no suspense and found the story just atypical of many others	1
13127	A13E1PKWJA3E8S	one of the stories was actually interesting, the others were just not that exciting. Some of the stories were just not all that great; the snowman story was the best.	1
13128	A1IGZJIN29DBJQ	Really weird book with odd sex. Didn't even finish book because it was so strange. Not my cup of tea.	1
13129	A14G7Q1O0T1AUU	This is a teenagers book, maybe. Predictable plot. Poorly written . I am surprised it took two adults to write this book.	1
13130	A1G7GW8DBJ5MB	downloaded this for kindle started to read it and just couldnt get into it not interested doesnt catch me in the begining	1
13131	A1KF8SQ291JDIH	I already wrote a review for this and don't think I need to send another one in on why I didn't like it	1
13132	A3OKVH4W02ON7P	This is barely a chapter let alone a book. I was soooo disappointed. This author so far deals with a lot of spoiled self centered people who regret too late.	0
13133	A1JK78GTQWZ2UO	What was that? Just when the story starts to get interesting, it ends!!!!! There was nothing at al to hang anything on.	0
13134	A1BQWDIEOZN3W9	Did not like this book at all.  I love romance novels but this book was short and too smutty for my taste.	0
13135	AE5IA4M4NQLY	A very ordinary tale with a handsome but not so bright hero and a beautiful dimwit as the heroine. Okay.	1
13136	A3UL9HOG0I2SZA	This one is about the children. Not as good as first two. Introduces a new charater, that I am not sure I like.	1
13137	A3MZSN527JJ5QI	Maybe I was looking for something different when I chose this book.  There's lots of sex, but nothing I'd consider a fantasy.	0
13138	A3FP52QAO94X30	I did learn a little more about teas than I knew before reading this book.  BUT, I wish there was more substantial information.	1
13139	A2YI1HCMXAH9LB	I should have read the sample before buying the book, but the blurb sounded really good.  I hated the way it ended and the relationship with all the characters.	1
13140	A30QNW64ISXF79	The storyline was good, but there was too much graphical sex! Too many useless words, and too many typos!My granddaughter wrote better when she was 12!	1
13141	AI8JBNTZHEPZJ	Four novels-very bland, very predictable. In no way could I recommend this collection, I forced myself to complete the book, all the while hoping the next one would be better.	1
13142	A3RPL8JIS2XMJ3	i didnt even finish reading the book.... it was just to slow and i couldnt be bothered finishing it so i removed it	1
13143	A1G7GW8DBJ5MB	got the book for free but it wasnt what i expected its ok but i never used it might be better for someone else	1
13144	AD1SDJV8H43KR	I was looking forward to maybe one or two good things to try before I committed, and I only got failures on uploads and frustration. App is junk!	0
13145	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	Book was horribly boring. I normally love the books by this author but this one, no. I actually returned it and got my money back.	0
13146	A1P1XVZ3T92HMC	I am soooo not that crafty. Might be great for a house mom with some time on her hands but I don't have the patience for this kind of stuff.	0
13147	A3CUWRVAKGEFHL	The book held no real appeal for me right from the beginning but I tried to plow through to no avail.	0
13148	ANSKB5TD05G05	About a fourth of the way into this book the print charges into nothing but jibbrish. What's up with that?  A waste of my time!	0
13149	A3YIREZP208T4	Premise for the story was good but execution was  immature.  Liked the characters but dialogue was from wrong era.  Please look up difference between pier and peer...	1
13150	A25VC4BARPMYKM	Not a favorite.  Stopped ready due to language in the story, and too much sexual descriptions. Might be ok for others, just not my style.	1
13151	A2HIT2QIS694MV	I love books where two people don't get along and then fall in love; however, it was the 11th chapter before their love as sparked.	1
13152	A3Q1KLWRFQ59JM	This book suddenly appeared in my book list. It was not ordered and there was no way of canceling it even thought the pricewas extremely &#34;fair.&#34;	0
13153	A2AH2L1VVUUAC7	This book needed more, I still really don't get it. Loved another book from this author Small Town Evil but that also was a bit to short...	1
13154	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	I tried several times to read this and I just couldn't. This story did not keep my interest. I tried, really I did. But no thanks.	0
13155	AB32EKTPOJ2LT	I was not impressed. The story seemed to go no where, the romance was like a side note. And I was not impressed with the &#34;glam&#34; of hollywood.	1
13156	A1XNUZ8KUU5UYX	Low rating because of profanity. I will get my money back for this one. I am not going to pay money to read such stuff.	0
13157	A3JUTTIFPQXJ8K	What a cute short story. It made me want more. I loved the characters. I would recommend this to my friends.	1
13158	A2MWDV98AWW00V	i started reading this, looking for more common quotes, but found it wad mostly religious quotes, it was also difficult to find quotes by topic	1
13159	A2FRD2VV1X4AN2	Starts too slow and just could never get my head around the storyline.  It might be what you like to read though so don't at least try it.	1
13160	A1AW3VU5X0M990	Utter drivel. I guess the readers who are jesus freaks will like it but for the majority of the readers this is just tripe.	0
13161	AD2SY1DBM3RO3	It's BS, as any smoker will tell you. But Carr's holding the carrot out to the smoking crowd. But his little plan doesn't work...or didn't for me.	1
13162	A4L6FZAS5AC5M	It wasn't for me, but I kept reading just because I started it. Better to read then twiddle fingers doing nothing.	1
13163	A11FF0H63VFFMX	Short story full of umm... Same sex.thought reading something different works be a little more editing.but this was fine. Needed a little something more.	1
13164	A3HDBDU450OXI7	This book was no good i did not get it what was the story about. I am sorry i brought this book	0
13165	A3SBCDQ5AQLMKL	I could have gotten this information on WikiLeaks. I like history and historical fiction. This book was a disappointment.Don't waste your money.	1
13166	A1CG7A1KBWAR4H	I wasnt overly impressed with the story, the plot, the characters, basically all of it. I definitely would not suggest this book to anyone.	1
13167	AQKFIPOWQEX46	Usually have enjoyed the Jack Daniels/Harry McGlade novels. This one was more like a first draft of a storyline. Sorry.	1
13168	A2W4Z60T0ND4OT	It was a good book but it was too short why only like a chapter should of told us why his best friend was at odds with each other	0
13169	A28REJAM6899K8	Just don't think it was written well. Would not read the other series. Found them to be too confusing and hard to keep up with.	1
13170	AD9DYEZBHRR3G	this is okay. simple and not much to it but worth downloading. it doesnt hurt anything to read it. go ahead!	1
13171	A2K7H6OEXM8NJV	Not a bad read for a Sunday morning, but feels like there are many details missing and rushed scenes that could had been improved with just a bit more in-depth	1
13172	A2HC0BBMCBR1KW	It was a very very short read not worth the money it should have been a free read I wish I could get my money back	1
13173	A2K3R6PIEHMJGT	There are many recipes in the book but none that I would use. They are dairy free n other weird recipes.	0
13174	ALGJUPAK5743P	not paleo!!!! and some missing ingredients	0
13175	A1AW9TDK2BGI43	I`ll tell you I give it a one and not good. I quit about half way this book was not good	0
13176	A2III2BW37BIAE	"Interesting concept, but all I can really say now is ""WTH..."" I'm so confused... maybe I'll understand better if a second part comes out."	1
13177	A22EY4X88058PP	I wasn't crazy about it....I don't know if it was the story line or that I had to get the chapters in installments???? I won't purchase any additional chapters!!	1
13178	A2BYPERST90D9F	This author writes a good tale. Shame that all her books follow the same sexual exploits. Storylines are good though.	0
13179	A35F12HT747W0H	I started out interested but not one of the five videos I tried to view would play so I deleted the book.	0
13180	ACNT917RKMW3M	Would not recommend this to anyone.  Story lacked interest in titillation, sensibility or originality. Save your money, time and effort.	0
13181	A1HR0WGQO7AUDC	It was terrible. It reminded me of a bad porn movie. Even if this book was free I wouldn't waste my time with it. Just bypass it completely.	0
13182	A16JVQQVD4FP5	The stories were ok..but I thought there should have been more to the story and less sex scenes..just my opinion.	1
13183	A8L86V50G2CLI	First, this booklet is poorly edited. Second, for an instructional piece it I sparse. Both in warning and detail. Not what I would call a prudent resource.	1
13184	A1RX03NMU4VGWM	First book was four stars, second one was a 2.5!  This one was barely a one star since I can't do a half star!	0
13185	A2VPW6AUH2WJTG	It was okay. I did not have a problem downloading it but I did delete it from my Kindle after I read it to the children.	1
13186	AM0CSGOB06ZJG	The author uses the popular boy growing up story line to promote his anti-tracking stance.  The book is mildly interesting, but offensive if you dislike behind used as a pawn.	1
13187	A07221093V3NS0NKIHX6O	Quick and easy does it with these recipes.  Nothing difficult but you will impress your guests with the down home taste that many recipes are lacking	0
13188	A1LCA95T4ATX1F	it's good but short and it leaves you hanging in the worst way. writing is great but I'm really pissed off.	1
13189	A3Q86MZSVUUAD8	i wish that this book was listed as young adult.it was a freebie and that was nice.it held no interest for adult readers.	1
13190	A24BB7ZQSVFD92	I knew this was short, but if it had a good story, I might have liked it. There was nothing I liked about it.	0
13191	A3FSTB28ISLRC9	I got recommended this book series. and I don't like it at all..the dialogue is terrible and its incredibly cheesy	1
13192	A2DM8ISQMH31CF	Just not a good story. Maybe it needed to be a little longer to add more story? I couldn't even think about reading about the other governess'.	1
13193	A1MJIF9GVCM3V1	Could not comprehend the basics. Found this story beyond my realm of realism. Could not find any logic at all.	0
13194	A3S699M4C0J589	how could a person who has professed to be so saved think to write such violence as though the role was was written just as the writer(subconsciously) had wanted to	1
13195	A31CZT0KCFGUF1	It just seemed to rehash everything I read in the series. It was definitely a good series. The characters were very likeable and I always love a female hero.	1
13196	A214RHMT8L3PR6	like a car accident so verry bad but you just can't look away and no matter what you just have to know what happened	1
13197	A2C1D3972SF51O	A lot of fluff and repetition. No real science or research to back claims. A few typos. Some of the claims are more than a little speculative.	0
13198	A1XG6VPBWYXWXE	I tried to finish but I couldn't. I stopped at the 35% mark. The story was moving way to slow and it didn't hold my interest.	1
13199	AVDZZFKFEMM42	Book is to short.... waste of time. Just when it starts to get good it ends!!!!	0
13200	A1V555JQB94P19	An item to take you away from reality. Not very serious reading. But, it is entertaining  and some what funny.	1
13201	A38ZQJCCXSLQJQ	Usually I thoroughly enjoy the mail order bride stories.  However, this one was &#34;simplistic&#34;.  And I didn't appreciate all the sex business which I just skipped.  Frankly I was disappointed.	0
13202	A3SUD3JMVF6DV1	Too short but full of potential... Love the characters of Maggie and Silas. Look forward to reading more about them but hopefully longer stories!	1
13203	A1J6Y4MADVB05Z	This book was not what I thought. It was alright but not a page Turner. The end turned out hood but it wad okay.	1
13204	A24E03EIFLPDA8	This booked moved very fast and was not a good read. The author could have put more into the book	0
13205	A6A6B8I2BK83V	Too slow and i dont like all the violence	1
13206	AI206T5L1QM7X	Oops, wrong one.  Too short to be considered anything but a short story and not very captivating.  Try Baby Blue The Albritton Letters by Lloyd Albritton...	0
13207	A23P53Z5YMD7ZM	This book simply stops in the middle of the story. There is no explanation, no resolution of the plot. It is like the author accidentally published a half written book.	0
13208	A197U7BJARN303	This story is an ok read but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. It starts off ok but the longer I read it the harder it was to keep my attention.	1
13209	A12K5Y2SEANYW0	Not too good this just seemed to be a screen play for a movie or just a dialogue between several people. Just not too interesting.	1
13210	A1R0OW4DOLKVL	Cute stories but not funny by any stretch of the imagination. I could take it or leave it. Keep writing, author. You'll hit your groove.	1
13211	A29LBQI20NW11L	I hated this book. It was poorly written, not funny, and boring. Only made it 30% through before giving up on it.	0
13212	A1LPS6RDS22D5N	Useless. Don't waste your money. Total placebo effect thinking - which might work for a little while, but not in the long run.	0
13213	A38STH7HRC6ACX	I prefer a happier clean ending not such an ambiguous one. I  found the relationships as well as the writing murky and dark.	1
13214	AVN5H64K37AT8	I returned the  Audible edition of this book.  Didn't like the writing, the narrator or the story line.  Very disappointing.	0
13215	A2A3WCQUVZQ70O	Okay book for younger readers perhaps.  Not really my kind of book.  I prefer historical novels rather than futuristic thrillers.	1
13216	A34V5FEWT7G9M1	Had potential but lost me along the way. It was ok in the beginning then it turned left and went south	1
13217	AGFLBA0XAJR8Z	Full of stereotypical depictions of church life. The plot was okay but the author didn't make me care about any of the characters.	0
13218	A3845G5NW1T2WB	Poorly written - thinly disguised porn - a complete waste of time.	1
13219	A16XHXWSB0GYDF	This book was poorly written and full of misinformation. Don't waste your money, just go to Wikipedia and you can find out a lot more information on worm farms.	0
13220	A45VBMWFTE3Z9	Wasn't good. The writing was weak. The story was weak and I found myself bored.  Overpriced too for the length. Almost,was a DNF for me.	0
13221	AOQZ05LNZ0C8J	The book was pretty lame!! I thought it would be much more interesting but ended up being a less than desirable read. This one I would not recommend.	1
13222	A2X8ZAXRT1D8KT	I stopped reading, 20 pages in. If that, it got weird and uncomfortable. Do NOT recommend to anyone under 18.	0
13223	A37GDFS75QLCPB	It wasn't a bad story but I really hate being left hanging and feeling blackmailed into buyingMore books to find out how the story ends.	0
13224	A311PPG2UBENEE	But got boring and just kind of fizzled out at the end. It was as if the author was just trying to fill empty pages.	1
13225	A2IXV49Z9F3UC5	The books were not entertaining at all and need alot of work.  someone should show you how to proof your work before you publish it.	1
13226	AJBABVPZ0URM3	Get it for free if you must.  It is just awfully written with no real character development and even less storyline.	1
13227	A1Y6ZJ2FQH4XIG	I didn't even finish reading this one. SO you can imagine. I didn't like it at all . I guess it wasn't my cup of tea.	0
13228	A8XOQ7VBLW32S	This book was a cute read. It only took a couple hours to finish it. It was just ok for me though.	1
13229	A38DIX88M5T94P	The same as before, to much b rated movie stuff here. Just let it go. Start over.Red some other books and get a good idea on what they are doing	1
13230	A1V45CBREMS2B	Just thought this could have been better. Towards the end , you had mindless babble. I know there is better out there by you.	1
13231	A3APZ6NZUR7EN8	This book was way too short for the price(usually a fan of the author).  Story was really rushed and characters needed to be built.	1
13232	A62L195HRL5LU	A few pages, a short essay.  W h at a set up! It's like a short chapter of a story, very disappointing	1
13233	A3HL7UA6QJB4CN	This was a long series and the ending was terrible.  I regret wasting my time reading it.  The characters were developed, but the ending needed more to conclude it.	1
13234	A3ICJZI2KK6PQF	Too descriptive. Made it boring. Is not a turn-on for me. Maybe it will for you! Could of been a lot hotter story.	1
13235	AKBVPI7KYF5CT	I gave it a 2 for the simple reason of the language and it was only leaving you with taste.	1
13236	A3G62MZBBRDQXZ	A couple of the stories were ok but most ended before they began. I'm glad it was free for sure.	0
13237	A2UUIUNX03MIDL	Books like this are ridiculous! No wonder men treat women like animals. This was borderline abuse both physically and mentally. Junk!	0
13238	AYZ0UEAG98RG5	A story that was as confusing as the characters, who were not only questionable but weak. The book was a weak read and poor.	1
13239	A11TT460OXJPVA	I found that this is not my kind of book.  I like more drama and a good story like vs. nasty big monsters and destruction,	1
13240	A3PNNQCYF9HGNT	2stars for effort, and how the book only got good towards the end... The characters were not interesting at all... not reading the next installment...	1
13241	A1KK9T63DOPGEZ	One of those books that I continued to read even though I didn't know why.  I finished it, but what a waste of time.	1
13242	AXI2Q2XTNSJ65	The title of this should be changed to &#34;Hey guys this isn't for you&#34; as it is the title is just false advertising.	0
13243	A32OUWXAM5LR1B	Ok not what i had in mind but it was an ok book.this book is more fir the crafty and thoughs who like sitting around selling their stuff.	1
13244	A1RCRBYSX7AA1E	I can't tell you exactly why, but this was not my type of story at all. Interestingly enough, I usually love an alpha man and his more delicate counterpart.	0
13245	A2FDHNWDURIZ6V	the information in this book was the same as is most books about the thyroid..nothing new reallythought it might be different or have new ideas	1
13246	A2DG6U47WIEABX	No, thank you! I wanted a fairy tale not a jenny craig fairy tale. Not my thing. Stopped reading after 10-20 pages.	0
13247	A17O3IALB0VVSA	The author writes very well.  The story is short but captivating.  I really wish the story was a lot longer.  The storyline has such potential	1
13248	A1BISS1TN5265G	This book was not very informative.  It was the same information I have heard for 10 years and does not offer hope for insomniacs.	0
13249	A3IQ12USN2WPB0	I didn't particularly like this story I only finished it because i wanted to know if Livie and Cotton ever get back together.	1
13250	A3S2AYBTEGWGZ8	The book seemed to jump around without any cohesiveness.  It never followed andy outline to combine the different chapters.  It could have been good.	0
13251	A262CE3LJ9Y0K8	The book started quite well, and got my expectations up, but it only wen cliche. The main character is a mental and physical drifter, and got quite unlikable.	1
13252	ALKWXV9QFSN01	To short of a story. It had potential, but just did not go far enough for my liking so I can only give it 2 stars.	1
13253	AXYHN7EAAVIVV	Horrifyingly bad. Pointless bloodshed with a weird cover. Do not download. Free is too high a price - save the space on your Kindle.	0
13254	A28REJAM6899K8	I was looking for something a little strained. Found this to be a little boring. Maybe the next one will be better.	1
13255	A33TSAV24FLFJ	Well, this certainly convinced me of Amanda's innocence and lack of involvement.  However, it was pretty dull reading for suchan interesting case.	0
13256	AC6ET6ATEPANY	Very disappointing.  Crummy anticlimactic  non ending.  Cannot believe the author leaves us with such an unimaginative and disappointing state.  Not worth my time or money.	1
13257	A233HGKAJO4YG4	This app is not, not, not free.  They want you to &#34;buy&#34; a subscription.  Get the USA Today app.  It is free and it is very, very, very good.	0
13258	A1PRKOP4DZGZ04	This sounds like some great recipes, but there is only a picture of a camera with an exclamation point. I would love to see photos.	0
13259	A25QOJSQ3LEJ6I	if you need some recipes i guess these books are ok, but im from the country and they are recipes that are not practical for where im from....	0

13261	A2IU8PE4SN0H4Q	Got tired of the whining and griping more then anything. The old ladies were boring as well as the story line.	1
13262	A1XFKGZYK3N43L	Returned it back for my money was not the reading material I wanted to read was under Gay Cowboy Romance and it was not	1
13263	A342XW827RTAEQ	I'm very disappointed. I have read all of her books and was very excited to buy this one. Only one very short chapter. Not worth the money.	0
13264	A3361XGKYF17S3	I don't think so a girl have sex with different men each month. This book is not for me. She makes women look bad.	1
13265	A3VIAB920GVUK3	I have read other things by Ms. McKade and have like them, but this one I could not finish.  I felt it was simplistic and boring.	0
13266	A32AUTWA8MM81K	The writing style is low and wanders.  There is no bite.  And the graphic sex-just because we are married.  IT IS STILL GRAPHIC SEX. NO THANKS!	1
13267	AP1JH819KQFTC	I didn't care for this type of plot, so I didn't finish the book. I guess I'm just not into this type of book.	1
13268	AFCD2VYPAWKNG	Once again, a book that is, for my part, just too basic; and most of the data is outdated.An update to more current business trends would be greatly appreciated.	0
13269	A3AY8E8L456T1K	This book was a very very short read. This book was about the length of one chapter. It was ok to read but not very realistic.	1
13270	A34ACAH25ZUKDX	This is not really my kind of book, I didn't really enjoy it. But it was written well for short stories.	1
13271	A3A7FF87LEVCQ1	"I thought it would be a little more ""doctory"" and a little less romancey.  Overall disappointed that this story was more vanilla than one might think."	1
13272	ALGJUPAK5743P	Nothing new here except that the title of the book is excessive with keywords -  sad to see deception like this on a respected website like Amazon.	0
13273	A2KYSR5JW22C2J	I could not finish this one.  It was trite and shallow.  I feel badly for not doing more reviews, so here is one.	1

13276	A388XBO57T6COX	this was to short and really not a story it could have been good if maybe it was longer it could have been good.	0
13277	A30OVMRHUPTXRP	Read more like  a text book. I was hoping for stories about some of the old Hollywood  filmstars from the past.	1

13279	AVVTVP12ZLNWY	After trying to read this book for the second time, I'm throwing in the towel. It doesn't keep my attention.  The story had potential, but somewhere that was lost.	1
13280	A2WPEJH5WQW6JK	I would not have bought this book had I known it was a very short book. What a waste of time and money	0
13281	A1EE05KGTY3VY6	I am not sure what the point of this story is for. A bunch of cyberspace hookers. No rhyme or  reason. Just a psycho mother withhooker daughters.What the heck?	1
13282	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This ebook was not what I was I expecting. I didn't care for this story plots. It had a little steam.	1
13283	A39K3158E8T26V	A very slow and confusing read. I like a story that starts fast and holds your interest and makes you want to read more. Sorry this did not cut it.	0
13284	A08981692VPAX0WDG69WO	I couldn't get interested in the but would keep coming back to it thinking it would get better. To me  it did't have much of a story. Sorry	1

13286	A19RV6KY64DV95	This is a very cheap  product and broke the second time I used it in my car.  I paid the extra and got a good one.	0
13287	ANNB9P330YYFX	I can hardly remember what happened. The characters are kind of predictable and there are no serioualy exciting turn of event. Not teerrible, but not memorable.	1
13288	A2ZTFVOSGYH6OP	This story was very cute and sweet. It's short and I would have liked a little more meat to the story, their coming together seeming rushed, but it was cute.	1
13289	A2Q95CRI8CONPE	This one was not worth the time and energy it took to click the buy it now button. Really bad.	0
13290	A2QD1N3R1UW7KU	Absolutely horrible. Couldn't even finish this book. Disgusting, and any other kind of name you can think of in that category.	0
13291	A2OPBFL7ELBK6M	I was hopeful of the complete Bible but the Psalms are missing whole parts.  I am not happy with this purchase	1
13292	A3PBE998L2AVJO	Right off, it was formatted badly for the kindle. Then it was more talk than action. It seemed to be written for younger readers	0
13293	A3LKZ2CX7TQJP0	Once again this will be  great book for a child one year of age or younger for a starter book	1
13294	A1SRZ0B5GV3M42	I know to suspend some reality for paranormal reads. I couldn't wrap my head around this. It was a quick read but I wouldn't recommend this.	1
13295	A1FENMNIPDVJ42	OK, This story just seemed ridiculous to me... I like a good romance, but this was a little drastic	1
13296	A2ZN6C51PHTKA6	The killer gets away with it. How ridiculous is that? Cant like a book where that happens. Don't waste your time.	0
13297	A2QF0OA3YH7TJN	I'm not sure what I expected, but was not too impressed with this one. Pretty bland and uninteresting. Hoped for more.	1
13298	AXE0DNM91LC36	this is just the intro to the book. I thought I would have a complete story. I feel ripped off!	1
13299	A0653433291SMBQM1ZO1H	This book was long and boring I think the writer lost track of her own story line and was confusted.	0
13300	AJ8J4AWQB1M1	These novellas are way too short & price has gotten too high. I've enjoyed the series but this will be my last purchase. Not nearly enough bang for the buck.	1
13301	A3JJ58Y8N9SKHB	The writing is very basic, maybe I missed the part where it was for pre-teens.  Good story idea, stilted dialogue. Makes me think I can publish too.	1
13302	A1L9FKVZW5DF8E	A somewhat well written chapter of a story.  No plot and not much of a story.  A waste of  time and money.	1
13303	A3EIMKYQNUEHPK	I didn't like it, the first story was too graphic.....ugh.  If I want to be scared I'll look in the mirror...	0

13308	A3ELQZTSDNBR9C	Ok if you want read about sexual experiences this is great book. I like a story with some romance not just sex.	0
13309	A2Q83ACRPSCWZ2	This story has to many lapses, holes and inconsistencies to be considered a good thriller/mystery .  The dialogue is stilted to the detriment of the story.	0
13310	A34N7F4UPQV86A	Kind of predicatable and not real interesting story. They meet fall in bed and thats it. not a good read	1

13318	A3KUC6OXV807IA	This is just a very short story. I sure would have liked it to be longer and carried on with characters.	1
13319	A1P6FPUE0T9I5T	Strange how so many killers, spies, undercover agents etc could occupy a single site on Mars.  Very poor ending -- continued in the next book?	1

13321	A3FGJIPKR349EL	This is a book of short stories that don't seem to have any real value. I didn't even finish it.	1
13322	A3VZEQDE2YDHLP	Not a great read and not funny. Wish it lived up to the title. It was about bunnies, but my 5 year old did not appreciate it.	0

13325	A35PXO2XEG2Y1L	This boggled the imagination.  Mr.Beard and too many strange characters to keep straight. Too many subplots. I enjoyed the first book but doubt I'll read another	1
13326	A197W8MNF706HT	The story felt rushed, like you were missing the first few chapters. Then there was a lot of missing background on the werewolf pack.	1
13327	A2LS79KXFNB9JQ	Just another love story. I wasn't too thrilled by it. Must be becoming jaded by all the others just like it.	1
13328	A3M6WUS58PCFJ9	This book seemed to end before it began. The pictures were fine and what was there was well edited and formatted.	1

13336	A3AYFYTVQ1TASF	bunch of useless articles that you already know or you just do not need to know. Forst book on Grandma was so good, I got fooled.Not any more.	0
13337	A2CBOVOOK3Q6D4	This story is really, really short. It wasn't bad and it had a lot of potential. This would have ranked higher if it was longer.	1

13340	A3TE038NLTPLYT	I hope I didn't pay for this book..Not a good short story..I'm disappointed ..Not even runoff words for a review..	1
13341	A1R14H15SZ5RG9	It's to short to even develop a story.  Why even bother yourself with a book with nothing to get into for it to be a good read.	1
13342	A23O8GFW3KCL9P	Meh.  This one really sucked which is odd because Bond is usually very good.  I've loved almost all her books.	0

13348	A1XV0X5V8SQN1K	I think this is a pre wool story, but not by Hugh Howery- not overly impressed.  I am thinking copy cat.	1

13350	A0653433291SMBQM1ZO1H	This book was pure trash and it should be rated as such.  This book is erotic trash and  is not worth reading.	0

13355	A2SCAB3VMPVQFH	The picture makes it look better than it is - nice black leather.  However, it is very chincy and definitely not forth $40.  I am actually returning it.	1
13356	A1EET132V3FY0V	This was a good book, but unfortunately it wasn't as informative as I thought it would be. It could have been better.	1
13357	A3TGY3ANGBNK7C	generally MC books and I are friends, but STORM and I were not.  The storyline didn't keep my attention and I didn't particularly like any of the characters.	1
13358	A1MFUAAGOS2KH3	this one will leave you wanting more and more. It also too short and will leave you panting in one seen.	1
13359	A1MFUAAGOS2KH3	you will have to read this to get what I mean by Hot Love so read it and I know you will not regret it if you do.	1

13361	A5ORNL5HK948T	I thought it was a dictionary.iam not reading it.i don't have any thing more to say about the book.goodbye good luck	0
13362	A2XKE02OF6Q1YQ	There's just not that much of a storyline here. I kept waiting for something to happen. Sweet characters but shallow plot.	1
13363	A30MUZK4VLV1KY	I read, I love to read, I read cereal boxes....but I had to make myself finish this book.  The characters did not stand out and the plot was thin.	1
13364	A3NIWNWQN50WSP	This was not what I expected when I purchased this book. It was not worth the price I paid. It was like reading one paragraph	0
13365	A28REJAM6899K8	There was only one instance where the mention of no panties came out. This was a strange read and hard to follow.	1
13366	A1ULRFNOXE2I08	This is a pretty low key book.  I was not impressed.  I almost stopped reading it a couple of  times.  It's pretty dull reading and not a lot of story.	1
13367	A2FMLJZUU1CPHA	Did not read it yet will read it I think it will be a good book and I think I will like it very much.	0
13368	A3JVCBQ0Z3D85I	after a few pages I deleted this book not what I expected. I was not expecting to read about bondage porn what so ever	0

13370	A2Z4MBN9VWMMS	There was nothing to this book. The little drama/action that went on was nothing to brag about. This book lacked a lot and therefore did nothing to the reader's mind.	1
13371	A38CRXBXE7L91R	While it is very erotic. It is very, very short. Really too brief for the price I paid. No world building, characters too shallow. Too expensive.	0
13372	A12OYN0X2GDUB	This is a serialized novella? Very disjointed, poor transitions, no back story.  Not very steamy.  Would definitely not pay for the next 'chapter'.	1
13373	A37V075RLK14A0	I just read the book, it was alright. Kinda weird reading. Not interested in reading part 2 of the story	1
13374	A1H5LEVLLHNB26	i got a headache reading this. It was like just any other book that consist of an ex-married-couple and their &#34;helpful&#34; friends.This should be elaborated.	1
13375	A2HXPF7762U2UO	This story has a very, very weak premise and extremely poor, distracting grammar.  Read only if you can overcome the shortcomings.	1
13376	A3RGFLMAPY11DU	Sorry found it boring , the storyline really didn't pull me in completely , but other reader's might enjoy the storyline .	1
13377	A19KEW2WDSK44I	There was not enough info to gain a knowledge about what I should or should not be eating. Save your money.	1
13378	A2H9JE8YGL44VH	This is a sample of the first few chapters. Why on earth would anyone do this on Amazon, where samples are free?	0
13379	A3UDEHONV7VZ8O	Too little story line, too much sex, but this is better than book #2.  Victoria is not real to me.	1
13380	A2MSTIQS33IZEN	This book started off good and the storyline was a great idea but as the book went on and on it became stale....woefully disappointed..	1
13381	A2JSYYJEWZWOO4	It was a good read but I don't like short stories. I wanted more with this story and was very disappointed that it ended as quickly as it began.	1
13382	A20W0ALUJMJ2F8	Ed Sullivan was an interesting person, but it doesnt come through very well. Too old, too many facts, not enough story. I would not buy again.	1
13383	ACGVE9N7DXHK9	I thought it was really bad - a disjointed story, not fun or compelling, poor grammar thru-out, misspelled words, Missing words, wrong words	0
13384	A3E7M05L9M3ZUC	Book is a real insult to young women. Would not recommend this anyone. Sadly there are some men like the stepfather out there.	0
13385	AG17ES9DSRXA1	It was an ok read. Very different take on santa and Mrs Claus. Not sorry I read it. I'm glad it was a free book.	1
13386	A2IRMNS1JW1GRH	Not my favorite.  I prefer more background stories and romance.	1
13387	A2AY41SQP3SFQJ	The main character was to insecure and the father to subborn for the good of the family he was trying to protect	0
13388	A2JLYQ8XHB6JB6	I love this series and couldn't wait for #6, but it was over before it started and tended to seem to be a prologue for #7.  I hope!!	1
13389	A3RZQK6J8TNPM	Well, I guess I just have no clue.  This was amazingly nothing.  I had to fast forward through it on my Kindle just hoping for something..........anything..........but alas and alack........nada.	0
13390	ACRG4TTEKP1KY	I gained nothing from this book. Common sense would help you more if you want to due clutter your life.	0
13391	A1Q322JUW38F1R	The book is fine, and cake pops make lovely decorations, they are just too much work for a fun snack.	1
13392	A3K2WJLI6B23P9	Sorry, so not my cup of tea, I didnt feel like there was much of a story, I skipped thru most of the book.	0
13393	ALLHJ13XTLLOL	I really didn't care much for this book.Just I really didn't see many recipes I wanted to try.Just my preference is all.	0
13394	AP5SLMENW8ODR	Very poor character development.  The author seems occupied too much with clothes descriptions for every occasion as filler.  The plot implausible and silly. A very weak read.	0
13395	A2YI1HCMXAH9LB	I really expected more and it just felt flat to me and not exciting at all.  I love MC books and this one just fell through.	1
13396	A3OCEYYZM0JLAZ	Weak main character she is always on her pitty pot	0
13397	A38COQA1VRDAMF	For me the book was just so so.  It had a lot of potential but none of it materialized.  Sorry.	1
13398	A2QQDV7Y545VZ3	The Billionaire's Desires Vol 1 was a very lacking read.There was not much substance to it, nor any character or plot development to it.  I was not impressed.	1
13399	AIGVAKWLB7UC8	Good start, needlessly gory, not enough suspense or depth to the story.  Exciting ending, though I won't be reading any more by this written-for-the-masses-writer.	1
13400	A23FKXZ5VNQUN7	I'm submitting this one cause I never got it to read yet.  So  you will see this a lot more.	0
13401	A2D7DS1DGAWGVR	Not really worth the scandal... but ok to read, i read it very quickly wish it was longer than it was	1
13402	ALOAS2HFMMWKE	This story was very long winded and seemed to be going in no particular direction. Very boring read I'm afraid.	0

13405	A302ICKAWESODG	The book my boring. The book had no real romance. The ending was not romantic. It was a predictable book that needs more substance.	1
13406	A2BHEPYIDR182L	I guess this was ment more for teenagers,cause I just did not get it. I was written for the younger crowd.	1
13407	A15LNY1WWTEGAL	This did not do it for me.  I may have inadvertently deLeted it, so I can't recall if I was just pissy.  I didn't enjoy it.	1
13408	A276LUWIEKINRI	"Insipid, juvenile, poorly written and not worth the time to read. ""A Husband for Margaret"" is just as bad. Reads like it was written by a high school student."	0
13409	AS4W8VTS5O3TJ	Distastasteful subject, written with every cop cliche ever invented. Corrupt cop, porn girlfriend, porn producer = predictable crap triangle. Don't waste your time.	1
13410	A2SQJFKA643JEY	It was just ok for me, nothing special . Eh it was a short story, so I can understand what they were saying.	0
13411	A1B3XAD24PWRAP	It was okay but I had a hard time buying the basic premise of the story.  Not sure I got into it very much.  Was also disappointed with the ending	1
13412	A38HEJELJ95UBR	The son in this is a little to innocent. he acted more like he was 10 than 20 or however old he was.	1
13413	A1PH97IIAG6IX0	I just couldn't get excited about the book.  I enjoy a good romance novel and this one seemed lame to me.	1
13414	A16Q5GMVAV27ZN	I gotta stop downloading them these free books..setting myself up for failure, I see. Oh well, better luck next time	0
13415	AX3W2FJYMPWZQ	So far, it's been a good series. Interesting, if not a little too descriptive of hand to hand combat  though.	1
13416	AKS0Y4MCINQF0	Don't even bother!  Very disappointed.  Garbage right from the beginning.  Read one chapter, thinking it has to go SOMEWHERE - - NOT!	0
13417	A29SIJI03D32RV	I liked the story but this needs to be a freebie because it definitely was way to short to be even considered a short story	1
13418	ANYFFX3SIZ57U	These are  NOT what I consider vegetarian.  This was a total disappointment to me.  I will 'll looking for a better book.	0
13419	A2VNSBCN6BMD6N	My cell phone cord works faster. The cord that came with the Kindle Fire should have been the adapter. Not worth the price.	0
13420	A169JX3H48MO0J	Well, if I ever took acid I think it would be like this book, strange...the writing was good it was just so way out there, hard to follow.	1
13421	A2IY7F9RH4KPV1	I got about one third of the way through the book before I gave up and decided to delete it.  Just not my type of book.	0
13422	AOFEF95ER28BO	All I can say about this book is, I am glad that it was free. The storyline was good but where is the rest of the book?	1
13423	A1OC3U7Y1AGFXB	The grammar was so bad, so full of run-on sentences, that I couldn't even get past the first few pages.Don't bother.	0
13424	A2S6318E1GAX5D	I thought this was a little short but a great short story for the most part. It wasn't worth purchasing though.	1
13425	A1NVOLL2JUOHZK	I couldn't enlarged the pages to read.  Deleted it since I wasn't able to read it.  Would have loved to share it with my husband.	0
13426	A1UMSB7LAW0RIR	Not what I had in mind at all. I thought this was going to be like The End of Me by Tara Brown.	0
13427	A3VFBMON7YGE8H	This book sucked! I hated Yung and I think it did not go deep enough into the characters. chante did not have a good storyline.	0
13428	A3U3DICM8NYHU2	This book felt like I was reading something from middle school. The characters were more shallow than a kiddy pool. Save yourself some time and pass on this one.	0
13429	AHEP4N0XIJR1K	Not as good as expected.	1
13430	AVKX9TBN5LD8L	Too short and not very good.  Even if it was a longer version or a different book by this author, I would not purchase any of Bella's books.  Sorry Bella.	1
13431	A3G8CP783TIL9J	It feels like it wasn't the same author who wrote part one.  This book was all over the place, I returned it.  Save your money and just reread part 1.	0

13437	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	okay book for true crimes, have read better.	1
13438	A14LH2NAV320JD	This story needs a different ending.  The ending picture has no connection to the rest of the story.  Rethink this one.	1
13439	A38XHZUHU5Q0RO	I didn't like it at all. Too fast paced and not enough details. I got it for free but it won't be staying on my kindle.	0
13440	A1QJ17BR5K3C8K	This book was too short I didn't connect with any of the characters and really didn't get the story. I am not sure if I will continue the series	1
13441	A37IKXFOAISZ29	This is just an exhaustive list of scripture on angels and demons. Little commentary. It wasn't what I was looking for.	1
13442	A5L5IOMTKXHQA	The story was nothing like I thought it was going to be.  It was not a good book or story at all.	0
13443	A3BJW61587WJUQ	I was highly disappointed in this book.  I think I purchased it for a little of nothing, and now I know why it was so cheap. Don't waste your money.	1

13445	A2I9SOM8NW320O	Not my cup of tea.  First part what super hot...then it got all about the arse ... especially ...to mouth	1
13446	A3BTYCOT0H64ZW	Isn't the kind of diy that I like to make and give. The food recipes are interesting and may be worth an attempt to make.	1
13447	ATN7NTDK6L5BI	Very little plot, needs editing badly. Mostly sex scenes and whiny vampire dialog.  Save your money, there are better books out there	0
13448	AEZTGDAXLO8TV	I had I work to finish this book. It was long and drawn out and underdeveloped. Thank goodness it was free!	1
13449	A3C713428J4MJ7	okay every single one of these stories went no where.not one i would recommend.unless you like stories with no ending at all.they just drop off	0
13450	A2GQ0PYSZCA9W9	I found it to be little more than a hype piece that really didn't offer as much insight into the series as I would have liked.	1

13452	A37YWD5NUX3C9G	Loved this story, but again, it's of a series and got to no conclusion on it.  Would like to see more.	0
13453	A2M2T7I87RVCCR	Started out as a really interesting story then just kinda fizzled and stopped.  Characters never really cam to life for me personally.	1
13454	A20SFN6NWCDBP4	This was a terribly written story. I feel bad saying so, because I suspect it was written by an elementary school student.	0
13455	A22X0PVMB3PC3V	Not sure what I expected but maybe something much different than this. To me the story should have been linger.	1
13456	A2T0TH59LWZS2I	My mother always said, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  So I'm keeping my mouth shut.	1

13459	A157FDWZGYPSW6	Really wanted to like this book but it just didnt get where you wanted it to go and so much talk about drugs was not appealing to me at all.	1
13460	A16W2JPT6X4SUW	I tried, I really did. We're still working on the barking. So many different ideas from different sources. Not easy.	1
13461	AVTOKS08HOEXG	A sweet little meaningless story with a very unlikely plot and an absolutely predictable ending. This is a seasonal tale and a very short read.  Too contrived!!	1
13462	A1SYILNKU2PFDU	SAD story. Settling does not make a good story. Deleted from my kindle. Will not want yo loan to anyone.	0
13463	A1SO8PDVE4AA4I	What a waste of $2.99. Infantile writing. No character development. Many misspelled words ,no editing. Couldn't get past the first 4 chapters or whatever they were. Let me repeat. ..TERRIBLE!!	0
13464	AJXW7ZFPE5LF7	Too short to get a real sense of how to rate it. I guess I would have to buy book 2.	1
13465	A355NQLK6SSIOR	Although the book is well written, the content is redundant and unAmerican.  It is insulting to a patriot to read it.	0
13466	AY81IS1PW4K4U	this is a joke.  what book?  thank goodness i didn't pay for it.  no story nothing	0
13467	A38OZ0XEGRW7G5	Boring book. To many characters at the first.  Not a stand alone book. Cant understand all the good reviews.. Not worth .99 period.	0
13468	A2O5M55DUSBNDM	Terrible story, couldn't even finish it. Has nothing to do with mma/ufc type fights.  Review seemed ok and rated at 4 1/2 stars......... don't waste your time.	0
13469	A2I3B013U3X2C8	Hmmm, the sex was interesting, storyline okay. seven seems overly emotional, cries over everything. Got tired of the waterworks.  Would not read again.	1
13470	A2IKKI4QJDM67Y	I should not have selected this book. It went over the heads of my 10, 9, and 4 year olds	0
13471	A11VVB5KUO817E	First off it is a shadow of all of another author's writing. It started out fine but then it so boring, unrealistic. Sorry.	1
13472	A25Z0YNESIHPMX	Weird storyline.  Boring details.  Weird characters.  Boring locales.  Did I mention weird and boring?  Waste of time.  Sorry so harsh.	1
13473	A3DE6XGZ2EPADS	The writing style is not attractive. After a few pages, I gave up. It is like chowing wood instead of tasting ice cream.	1
13474	AO0XCSHSXC0NX	Wow, a little bit too much hard core for me.  I will admit I was sucked in but will say I am happy it was just a short story	1
13475	A39VI1JDJNICSA	the book started out strange and ended strange and it just ended with out any fan fare like i said before the book was just strange	1
13476	A1QJ17BR5K3C8K	Although this was a short book it fell really flat for me. I enjoy reading F/F and this was not one of them	0
13477	A3RZXB81X0O6EI	It was terribly hard to pronounce the Aztec names & places. Didn't fill the bill. I didn't even finish the book.	0
13478	A23MNCYQZMFHQV	I love to read Simon wood's books. This one is morbid and makes the reader and victims skin crawl. There is not much guessing here. Just outright gruesome.	1
13479	A3801AFH5JO56U	I was disappointed in this book. After reading Crazy Summer this book was a let down. I brought one and two and don't know if I can read number 2.	1
13480	A8SW390Q5JNJX	Wouls not recommend this book as it was trite. Not well written and not very interesting. Barely made it thru this one.	1
13481	A3HIDIUXLK7WJ9	Its very tedious and long winded in places. Don't empathise much with the chief protagonist - she is not very likeable. Some other characters are more likeable.	0
13482	A19EIJ8RE7XA9U	Talking animals? No I didn't think it was cute. The narrative seemed choppy and didn't flow well for me. I couldn't finish it.	0
13483	A2WF93EYZ3A0XX	It first started out good but as it went on it made no sense.  I would not recommed this book to anyone.	0
13484	A8GLSUFX1P9XC	never read it. I did not get around to it. Then I deleted it. It is probally a very good story	0
13485	A332O7GDWT7W1Z	Glad it was a short read.  The story line seemed like it was written as a first reader for Scholastic early elementary school.	1
13486	A2FMLJZUU1CPHA	I have a Kindle fire not a Kindle fire HD I paid for this book but I did not get to read it I didn't read it all the way.	0
13487	A2ZEM3S7UB64OS	writing is trite, language is pot-boiler like,plot uninteresting. Theme could could have been better developed, had possibilities. Faux hip characters.	0
13488	A3LACA14E9P5MP	Great great story, details were very well done. A constant movement within the lives of the characters. I recommend this one.Teresa ReinertWeatherford, TX	0
13489	A2BKX3P162KTY0	B/c that's about how long it took me to read this, way too short, not even long enough to make me enjoy the story	1
13490	A1YEC32BA3N53K	too any confusing story lines and characters. Why so much death? The stories needed a little more construction and a lot less destruction.	0
13491	A1E4DPIKV5HGP3	all i got from this was sex sex sex... not sure what else happened.. the blurb pretty much summed up the whole story	0
13492	A9R3B0KHAMFCA	I hope I didn't pay for this I don't remember. Ok foe a sub sequel. I will definitely not pay for more short stories.	1
13493	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Mistaken identity.  Game playing.  Hot sex.  And more.  Short read, not that I cared to read more.  Glad it was free.  Not terrible	1
13494	A3UIG3YQ6ABHA2	An interesting story line that cannot support all of the drama.  The book is written with broken, choppy sentences that tend to distract the reader.  Not a book  I enjoyed.	0
13495	A34WBC0KCO4P9H	I was not impressed with this book at all. It started off bad and continued throughout. I won't be waiting to see what happens next.	0
13496	A1J9S1Y0X6XLIE	There was no ending to the book. Very disappointing. The book ended without me knowing what happened. Why did they do this?	1
13497	A15BNYZEJ78T0Q	Started book one and just kept going until I finished all three in less than three days  will look for other books by Noel hynd	0
13498	A25CP6UY1I2W5X	Not to my liking.  Felt like I was starting in the middle of a story.  Could not get interested in it.	0
13499	A13WHM5BLPGEBW	Remove the erotica and some violence might be ok for a 10 year old. Too many surprise characters makes the  story hard to follow.	1
13500	A3M3ONSKOWH9GR	This book could have been so much better. The combative relationship between the two leading characters was just silly.  I would not recommend this book.	0
13501	ANGZC8G8G2FMR	This was totally ridiculous. Don't waste your money. If I could have given it 'No' stars I would have. Sorry Ms. Hall.	0
13502	ABTFJSY7FJJ92	Not my favorite of the Sole Regret series.  I may not read anymore after this one.  The ones before this one were good though	1
13503	A3F8ZIQHE0MEUP	Cute story but the characters were rather juvenile.  It was almost like they were mentally challenged rather than mature intelligent adults.  Left you hanging in regards to the letter.	1
13504	A2W784TRZ05K2T	I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE GAME.  WHY DO I NEED A GUIDE TO A GAME THAT I CAN'T EVEN DOWNLOAD ONTO MY KINDLE	0
13505	A25QOJSQ3LEJ6I	this set isnt one of my favorities....i would recommend this set to the younger audience who might be teens or a little older.....	1
13506	A1SFYDUWYRAHH0	Had trouble staying with the story.  Still not for sure why she killed so many people.  Took all day to read	1
13507	A3A7FF87LEVCQ1	"By-the-numbers story with absolutely no surprises.  The descriptions fell short.  The ""oh-my-gosh-this-really-happened"" preface doesn't make up for the completely contrived nature of the situation."	1
13508	A68MOSR2NZID8	I did not find anything even mildly funny in this read.  Lame and clean but some do not even make sense.  Clearly I do not recommend this.	0
13509	A2ESF2SE53GQ0P	DNF at 16%&#8230; total trainwreck, and not the kind you want to rubberneck at.Sorry I was expected so much more from this	0
13510	A17JPUQ6UV424	Returned this book because I can find all of the information straight from online. It's good if your a complete dummy in the head.	1
13511	A1KQA3VU3ALSGR	i really didn't get what was so important about him. the book was to short with not alot of back story to it	1
13512	A3TYJ2S73KS7MP	Reads like a novel from the 1940's - handsome ne'er do well hero meets beautiful love of his life and the good guy always wins.	1
13513	A2JQVCPI9HC72W	Blah.  So bored skipped to last two chapters and found just as uninteresting as the beginning.  Can't wait to delete.Yup	1
13514	A30JL5HND4ZKT3	I did not like all of the cursing words in this book and would not recommend it to anyone.  Also, I did not finished reading it.	1
13515	A1TVD3MJV93510	Stupid, no point to the book. I won't be reading more books by the author. I don't suggest this book to anyone.	0
13516	A3GLKDD9X679JT	It's a really nice love story & I liked the ending.  I just felt like it was missing something. I can't put my finger on it.	1
13517	A1J9MC4ANC9LVZ	I was bored I knew what was going to happen with every turn of the page. Very very very bored	0
13518	A2VZCC8Z6XOZCL	Not much substance to this contemporary romance novella.  Just OK as a light, very light, read. Needs more character development, interaction, and drama.	1
13519	A3T2M22E4B5EL9	I haven't even been able to read through more than three chapters of this book. Maybe someday it will hold my attention but really doesn't keep it at this point.	1
13520	AJRYPPA566O8I	This story is a somewhat different mail order bride book.  It could have been much better. I read it all hoping there would be more to it, unfortunately not.	0
13521	A3SI4OM80M92MP	I tried to give this a shot, as the characters seem well written, but gave up at about 30%. I was bored out of my mind.	1
13522	A1PYPC0SGTL8PV	This was a fast paced and very strange story. I  am not sure if I will read more of this author	1
13523	A3FIQRQK9XMY2R	I thought this would be a good one to share with my grandson. He did not enjoy it so neither did I.	1
13524	AL90H8UKGOIYN	Good thing I got it for free.  Nothing new. Certainly NO secret. Another book that tells you what to do and not how to do it.	1
13525	A3VP3JOYGOBOMH	It is free so nothing lost but the pattern s  must be for tiny people, using a yard of fabric for a skirt. Don't get your hopes up.	0
13526	ALKWXV9QFSN01	I could not get into this book. Made myself read it and no real ending. Frustrating when authors do this.	0
13527	A1NZ9OAHTPJGFB	Didn't like the quality of this book.  Not a lot of information in this short book.  Much of the tips you can just find on the web.	0
13528	A2XU0JKWBZ1ECC	Too much silly romance for me, this is not my type of reading stuff. Apologies to readers who find this entertaining, I will try with other books.	0
13529	A20UE22HSZO7HD	This one could have been better if a little more thought went into it.  It was just too short for me.	0
13530	A2KI4TRB8AUD3J	so bad confuskngglad this was free.  bad beyond belief. deserves a zero star.confusing ridiculous boring repetitive repetitive repetitivehow did this get published??????	0
13531	A2FLLX4CQRUMP3	Pulpy and over-wrought romance.  Will pass on this author, especially marketed in this format, in future.  Try Madelaine Urban and Abigail Roux.	1
13532	AT4NSX17KP674	I am tired of cliff hangers in general, but this one in particular.  Looking for a serial killer  Well, just keep on looking; it's not here	1
13533	A1AQ03E9O4J0ZT	IT was very confusing. used a lot of unacceptable words to me. I would not recommend it to anyone. VERLY poor.	0
13534	A1CQE13M9UBJYR	The first book was boring and pretty predictable. I didn't even bother to read the second 2 because of how little the first held my interest	0
13535	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Actually pretty good.  A short.read.  Liked the story setting.  Could have been more to.it though.  Not quite 3 stars though	1
13536	AVZWI6NFZ608S	Never finished this book.  Started it several times and quit about 1/3rd of the way into it.  Just didn't hold my interest.	1
13537	A30LBR2VOXBST7	Not enough development, even in a short work, for me to enjoy this one. The changes in Evan, are too abrupt, and forced for me.	1
13538	A20B4SMKP7VYQX	this story was too short to enjoy. it ended at the best part. it was written very well, but needs to be longer.	1
13539	A121TEI0LJEGPB	I was not impressed with the writing and could not finish the book.  It was probably my expectations and not the author's failure to entice.	0
13540	A2BHEPYIDR182L	Not a great book at all. I just couldn't get into it. It was beyond boring. Not well written at all.	1
13541	A910I4E613DJN	Pages are missing ,just not complete the pages were repetitive and things were just missing,it's nor organized,a waste if a buck.	0
13542	A134OIV6OF1SKK	I do not know exactly why, but I wasn't hooked by this book and it was sort of flat. The story was predictable and there was a lack of action.	1
13543	AYUMJTUNX4A5R	I finished reading it only because I never leave a book halfway done. The story was decent but I did not particularly like it. Not my cup of tea.	1
13544	A1GSIRUFGBLTAF	a hot mess	0
13545	A1FI3UX24TRLVH	Poorly written, sex short story. Not worth my time.	0
13546	A2MZ8TXGPG607T	Similes oh my, Simile me to death. i had to stop and try to figure out what was what. The whole story tripped and stumbled.	1
13547	A3IYTKFRY1V9Y	Brett Cornell is a very annoying character.  Three chapters of his &#34;ME ME ABD ONLY ME &#34; was too much Brett for me.	0
13548	A324D0KCEO2H4P	Go to Goodreads dot com or AllRomance ebooks. Book was written/published for M/M Romance Group's Love's Landscapes, 2014 Don't Read in the Closet event.	0
13549	AG2KFWY95QZC1	Loved the title of this series, but it should have ended after the first book. The 2nd book really dragged and I almost didn't finish it.	1
13550	A1ZCSUVU953RTC	I was left a little confused through this book, I guess I'll have to keep reading them to see if it starts making more sense	1
13551	A2LLWCQVYKYF0F	I am not into occult, aliens, zombies and etc. others would probably enjoy this, but was not what I thought I bought	1
13552	A32ZH1FZY8FK7B	After 3 pages I was totally turned off. I read some reviews again and gave it another try. Nope, still couldn't tolerate the character or the writing.	0
13553	ADO9QCTOPPQLK	I didn't finish the book	1
13554	A3P9D9ZYQS5MMZ	I couldn't say which story was worse. There were so many typos and mistakes missing words you name it. Very poorly written. Stupid storyline.	1
13555	A2QKG13HMR71Q2	I would have liked to know it was a Spyglass Lane published book. The Christian book I'm into is the Bible and not murder mysteries.	1
13556	A1QDUJ2F7TWX3B	I don't understand why authors separate one story into 3 short ones...oh yeah probably to make more money.  This is a disappointment informally like Kelly's work but this gave nothing	0
13557	A9RQF21KT0J38	Don't waste your time or energy on this story . Thank goodness that it was free and I didn't waste my money :(	0
13558	A2B2YG3CRE2A57	This was a dumb book.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  The first book - 50 Shades of Alice in Wonderland wss much better.	1
13559	A25TQOFU1EAJXF	Short, rushed, an unexpected but also unsatisfying ending. As far as short stories go, this one doesn't even come close to making the favorites list.	0
13560	A17G9P3WV5VVC3	I only had to read a few pages to discover this book to be vulgar and offensive. Therefore, I didn't read any further than that.	0
13561	A1BXXIAROOQYNF	Not really what I was looking for. I just read it because it was free. I will not seek out the rest of the series	1
13562	A2PF93RIN0GRF2	I don't mind these but I think that parents need to have their own style of discipline.  I don't know how I feel about this book.	1
13563	A1OUDZ04L16GK1	Very boring and the h had no backbone. The H was not very endearing and the story line was just okay	0
13564	A2LOHSNIV5E4QT	Poorly written or poorly translated, I'm not sure which.  Too preachy for my taste.  Just not my cup of tea.	1
13565	A1NB5S5340S9TN	It could be better.  It would  be better if there was a bit more info on each persons crime. ok	1
13566	A34RNZ3SQ4ULYH	Not my kind of book so i quit reading and deleted it from my Kindle.  Sorry I wasted my time.	1
13567	A2YC52SMXZ8MQM	This was not thought out well at all.  Too many gaps in the story and then trying to fix it in. Glad it was free.	0
13568	APF7WA8PU5AL9	IMHO ...... jumbled writing....... couldn't read past the first 10 pages....... story wasn't coming together for me at all :(	0
13569	A1YKW12FKX5NXR	This story seemed to have had so much potential, but it was so short, I thought I had missed something, guess I never realised I was getting a short story...disappointed	1
13570	AZ66ODY5UXF4W	Sorta boring..probably would have been better if the story line would have been longer.  I can not think of what else could have helped this book.	0
13571	A134OIV6OF1SKK	I love Gena's Lords series, but this one is not for me. I wasn't captivated by the world og the buildup.	1
13572	AVO8UB9IDYW1I	A cutesy love story, and somewhat predictable. The bedroom scenes were pretty bland. All in all, a little vanilla for my taste...	1
13573	A3PBE998L2AVJO	Seemed to be written for a younger audience. It was way to slow for me. I am only negative because I cannot be positive.	1
13574	AVYOJJDSPWNL9	This book didn't make any sense to me. There was no details, There was no character development, the book was rushed. I don't want to read Part two.	1
13575	A2TC9KURETDVX7	Too much over and over.  These maniacs seem to repeat each other and these books repeat each other.  Not worth the money	1
13576	A2Q95CRI8CONPE	Dumb. This is the only word I really need to use. But since I need a certain amount of words for the comments its a little longer to describe dumb.	0
13577	A11MGRPB39FSED	Rediculous waste of time. Poor character development, unrealistic on too many levels to count, preoccupied with nudity and sex.  Will not read this author again.	0
13578	A5CJ50B3FYF66	It's good story but, don't ordering more little parts of story. So I well not get any more of the story.	1
13579	A2JIVWXEOUBLRK	It doesn't really make since speaking that it's short but part 2 might help??Maybe I should read part 2 + 3?	0
13580	A350Y4L5YNOUDP	when i bought this i had high hopes but this was so dull.  it had no emotion and i felt no connection between the characters. i was very disapointed.	1
13581	A1UK1XN5S70O0R	This is the most stupid book I read in my live very des appointment free is cost more that you think	0
13582	A1GHV20HSBV5Z	It was vague,but good. Maybe too much technical jargon,and a little dry,for little kids to understandI thought that it would bring up love a little more,or lust.	0
13583	A2VD0TY7RU416P	Kind of creepy but not much of a plot line.	1
13584	A11YHUE48RJRTD	a Great first book from the author. Would have enjoyed a more optimistic take. but an engaging read overall. look forward to future works	1
13585	AH3AJ4YZNOP58	These are really archaic recipes.  Interesting as an historical artifact, but I don't actually think I'll be making any of these recipes.	1
13586	A28REJAM6899K8	Practice does make perfect but this was not my forage. Practice with a male would have been better if they were not so selfish.	1
13587	A3B0VXY2UKMSW1	I could not get into this book for some reason.  I got almost half way through and finally gave up.	1
13588	A3P6W3MW9W7DMG	Ehhh, definitely a Lifetime Movie type story.  Cheesy and predictable, plus I didn't really believe any of the romance between the main characters.	1
13589	AS7PMQ1OTFFXQ	I prefer books where the hero doesn't share the heroine with his friends. Other than that, the intensity between the characters was great as was the writing.	1
13590	A22D05OFVKB44J	I found this story very different . Good thing for me that it a short . Tis' the season - give it a try !	1
13591	A2WD0WFFAW7R61	Started this book but didn't enjoy it so I didn't finish it.  It may pick up later in the book but just didn't waste my time.	1
13592	A2WLD5T7QWC2A5	UUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHH! I'm truly annoyed with this cat and mouse game called Great Exploitations. Is she seriously going to drag this out???? I'm more annoyed at myself for buying these books.	1
13593	A28REJAM6899K8	Did not enjoy this. There was not the normal Zane I thought it would be. The forgiveness part was good. People need to really listen sometimes.	0
13594	A2KWG2RILE81WU	Not quite sure about some people who rated this 4+ *hmmm* I was so disappointed and felt I cannot really rely on these ratings anymore. *sighs*	1
13595	AXJOK8KXSBUKK	Usually I read the first fifty pages before I close a bookIt killed me to read that much. Plot was weak and the characters were so undefined.	0
13596	A235FUKFAQKT76	I have liked joe hart from the beginning but did not care much for these short stories...but will continue to try his books	1
13597	A2XFQGY9TL1X02	I really had a hard time reading this one. I really thought it was boring and I do not recommend this at all.	0
13598	A2JFLX1FDSFF5C	English was obviously not her first language! I was expecting more detail;  she really just gives a headline then leaves to the next topic. Disappointing.	0
13599	A3S5CBVNWSRPTV	This book was really lack depth and character. Usually I enjoy books about vampires and werewolves, but I just could seem to get into this one.	1
13600	A3CUWRVAKGEFHL	Too gritty for me. Too much of the underbelly in dirty, disgusting homeless people. I felt like after reading what I could stomach, I needed a shower.	1
13601	A3OIQPWM0F5R63	Didn't get past the second chapter...maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for it that day...or the next...or the next!	1
13602	A18A92OSJT5X9Q	This book has potential, but it is unfinished. So far it is not a book, just two locations and the introduction of the subject.The book is not completely HSP friendly.	1
13603	A2P9IJCJKKR0LI	I am so incredibly sick and tired of these wimpy women. We have brains and backbones. We need books about real women.	0
13604	A1EET132V3FY0V	This was a very steamy novella. And although I did enjoy reading it, I felt like the beginning could've been better. :-;	1
13605	A1FKDYRAHKH1DN	Be fore warned, this is not Christian. Just because a few Bible verses are carelessly thrown throughout this story does NOT make this Christian fiction. Multiple sex scenes as well.	0
13606	AZF1M0BO0JTE4	Not quite what I expected. Not what I want to keep in my reading list. S&M. Glad I got it free - it was worth the price	1
13607	AW1CXD3OQ3XX4	Not worth 99 cents, short and pointless.The main characters aren't worth caring about, the premise is not believable, and the friends are one-dimensional.	1
13608	A1ZA9KQAWM3ZPV	I have a vol. Switch on my fire HE. The on off doesn't. Light up. My plug ins are on the side.	1
13609	A1MGGMVID25VVI	Lacking in pretty much everything. Spelling, grammar, plot, character development... Everything.  A waste of the half hour spent not believing that this was the writers best work.	0
13610	A20NB9K7IXKAH0	This book did not have an ending and this seems to be a normal thing with ebooks. This book had too much profanity and storyline not good.	1
13611	AWC5QLK1KD0SA	Very boring jokes. I didn't like it . I have heard all those jokes before. I might try something else later	0
13612	AVRYGBHNOZLWP	A bad intent of a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray. The characters lack depth and the story is not there.	0
13613	A5Q0JC7MYILG8	It wasn't the best...it was kind of drawn on and didn't grab my interest like some have.  I probably won't be purchasing the next book.	1
13614	A18FN2HD0OME8	It was alright. Nothing special about it but it was a quick read. I can't give it more than two stars though since there really wasn't much to it	1
13615	A6QKSIUNG8KP7	a very short story. didnt seem to go anywhere. was expecting a bit more. would have liked some more background info	0
13616	A2CSXSDT0UJ15T	Started out strong, and then various story elements just fell apart.  There was potential here, but it really never got where it needed to be.	1
13617	A1SPKCPR0BAZMY	This story is ok, but the writing is terribly clumsy and immature and detracts from any of the good bones of the story.  I found it really frustrating to read	1
13618	A1J1K8QRC5YPYU	The ending was garbage on a stick.Ut started out good but then It took a turn for the worst as it approached the end.	1
13619	A3MBCT5HKPSI7K	I didn't enjoy any part of this book.  I enjoy fast paced reads but this book was all over the place.	0
13620	A34FGMJ3K5O6GT	This was a goofy story about a woman getting it three ways by a father a sons that are wolfs. I like wolf stories, but honestly this wasn't.	1
13621	A1SSGNIPF8DVOB	This book was nearly impossible to read because of all the errors.  The ending seemed like it was written in a big hurry.  Don't bother!	0
13622	AMXZEX5LOKDY6	words can not describe how poorly written and racist this is. it had no point. i didn't get it..i just stopped reading . glad it was free	0
13623	A2U9X4JC9F4JWX	It was interesting but too short.  I have read most of the books about Roswell and I am a firm believer that they came from another planet.	1
13624	AEV8N1ELFIIRS	As with the above, I cannot review a book I am not able to read because it will not download onto my Colby Android tablet.  Please cancel this order.	0
13625	A15Z8GJKB4P6A5	Do not waste your money.  It was a badly written  book. A complete waste of time.  Very short. No plot	0
13626	A290Z0REDT7196	DID NOT HOLD INTEREST FOR HALF OF BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER.  RETURNED AFTERWARDS DID NOT WANT TO FINISH	0
13627	A33EU1JHKVRTTK	Was having trouble keeping interested in the story.  Could us a little more help in the beginning of the story.  DIdn't 'take me away' like other books do.	1
13628	ABF1WDL89HOJR	This story needed some work. It's lukewarm to me, and honestly? I didn't pay anything and I still wanted my money back. Couldn't get past the second chapter.	0
13629	A1ZSUFGI6DSAEP	I am so very glad that this book is finally over!! I didn't like it very much at all, it got slightly better the last like 5-10%.	0
13630	AP845FFUU0OO7	This book was interesting but only had 5 chapters!!! And it ended suddenly..I thought that my kindle had not down loaded the whole book becuase of the way it ended..confusing!!!	1
13631	AU2DB1OQ49F1C	Coulda been a lot longer. It felt way too rushed, even for a quickie. But like I said, it was free.	0
13632	A3ANO8MT4P12D8	this started out very good but at the end it just wasn't as good as wanted it to be. I will not be reading part 2.	1
13633	A10ZBE46C6NIKS	this book was an initial attempt  at getting a free Kindle book and wasn't what I thought it would be.	1
13634	A235NU3KW6O9SD	I started this book and just couldn't even make it through two chapters. I don't care for the way it was written, wasn't flowing for me.	1
13635	A32AUTWA8MM81K	Seriously!  This is pornographic!  No thanks!  No imagination!  So written by a man!  No thanks.  So you left all your IQ points somewhere else?	0
13636	A3DD7MIZODJXBC	Too many descriptions of the environment and pages and pages of it while the characters are patiently waiting to play a part.  I cannot get to enjoy this book.	1
13637	A1RKOFP20BTNHG	Once more, a book that was  purchased in error... I did not realize it was written as a stage play..	1
13638	AYB00N9VQAO8W	Sorry, it was just okay. Nothing that I would go out of my way to purchase. I wanted a quick read but this was not satisfying.	0
13639	A2BJ8I16EBFRET	Why? I understand that we all get ideas but some ideas are simply NOT meant to be written about. Great fantasy but not a great short novel. Just no.	1
13640	A2QKFBEZ4QZYNN	I could not finish this bookI tried, I simply couldn't.The premise should be good.  But..  it just dragged.	0
13641	ABE92G9YG2LHB	Forgettable.  Better than the previous 'short' novel I read on line, but didn't make me jot down the author as  a new find.	1
13642	A2U0P722CPY6QM	This book had a good story line going but to short in my opinion the author could have done a lot more.	1
13643	A3UG8USZ9B77IA	It was good as far as it went.  I as expecting a novel and got only a short story.  Wishing it would have been fleshed out into a full story.	1
13644	ADWU48SIFMGO9	I, like S. Wright, expected a story. It doesn't have a good one. skip it. I wish I hadn't paid 0.99 for it.	0
13645	A23BS90GTA9DX9	have liked most of this authors stories, but not this one. I was just not to my taste. But her other things have been great.	1
13646	A223A1YSN6B725	The lead female in this story came off as an idiot. If you are looking for a book with a heroine that has some sense, this is not the one.	0
13647	A1AQNPA5RS4O02	Poorly written for me. I need more details, arranged better and better proofreading. Needs more actual information and less filler.	0
13648	A356K1MI6WSXPS	My niece did not enjoy this book.  I did not enjoy this book.  The cover did not make her want to read it either.	1
13649	A20R37WRPLUM1D	I like the first story, Dirty Boys, but did not care for the rest in this collection. The writing is OK, but the subject matter is not to my taste.	1
13650	A2Y0K749REWG06	I couldnt get into this book. I wound up not even finishing it which is something i never do. Its a shame really	1
13651	A1DFS9ORBOJZ5A	Not as good as thought. Many of the &#34;forbidden books&#34; just ramble and keep repeating themselves; no wonder they were forbidden.	1
13652	A31X23DF54XV3B	Very short and not very hot at all. Rushed sex in the ocean, and a f/f scene with not much detail.	1
13653	ALX73Z37JY4W2	writing was less than	0
13654	AHEP4N0XIJR1K	Could not get into this one.	0
13655	A1HAO8KPV8111I	Nothing a little common sense doesn't cover... maybe ok if you get it free... don't buy it though! Not that good!	0
13656	A1HKCY9ODGA	Don't know----haven't read it yet.  I'm waiting until I have my upcoming surgery and will read them.  Looked like it might be good.	0
13657	ALX9G21BD8MMY	The start was too slow to make further reading worthwhile. I realize that a series may need background, but this is too much background to wade through up front.	1
13658	AF1YKDP1DLZTA	Rehash of bad coke deals and bad writing. sorry. call them the way I see it. too boring in lack of good action and plot	0
13659	ATT80J7U3U6YB	no matter how the writer tries to explain the relationship as consensual submissive and dominant, it just doesn't fly. Hated both characters.	0
13660	A3IF89JE3HT12D	Another useless book. These patterns are awful.  The pictures show the finished project but the projects look like they were done by someone new to crochet.	0
13661	A2P6Q0M2LSCW6N	I did not enjoy these books.  characters were not believeable.  I would not recommend these books to anyone at all	0
13662	A2D7QI059TVT20	I did not read this book, I don't even have this book. It was on my wish list, but not on my tablet	0
13663	A2YTF2KJJRHMXF	you write it	0
13664	A241KGBWGBLNEA	This book didn't inspire the warm, fuzzy feeling like a good romance should. It was a little dry and boring.	0
13665	A7U182M2MZQTR	Ok, so the original 50Shades was crap. Utter cow pat. Boring, inaccurate, uninspired.. WHy people bothered to buy such bootom expulsions is beyond me.This is no better.	0
13666	A1G613GQL0WJ0T	one would have had to read all the previous books on the series to understand this very brief book. Don't recommend	0
13667	AUJ7BG2QB7VPJ	The plot as described seemed interesting but the book diidn't capture my interest after the first dozen pages.The description accompanying the beginning of the story left be uninterested.	1
13668	AGAN6583I4QSF	this book was very hard to read, to many charters, makes you wonder was life really this dull during the war.	1
13669	A1MGGMVID25VVI	I have never read a book with so many pointless product mentions! Like reading a poorly written short story by a middle schooler.  Waste of time.	0
13670	A1KEK1S9VYOJ1Z	I can only view this book as fictional.  This is the first &#34;spiritual&#34; book I have read that has spaceships.  Interesting but should not be classified truly spiritual.J A Druce	1
13671	ALQIYJI7EOZ3T	I,personally did not enjoy this book. It was just too weird and gross and ended strangely. It left too many loose ends.	0
13672	AFRCVOVCZLVJU	The first few chapters were okay. But, then came gibberish  and more gibberish.  I thought it would become funny at least, but no luck.  Too bad.......	0
13673	A1BUA3LAY7A8ZK	I read everything but this was the typical alpha male and the poor confused female that he dominates. It was a free book so I have no complaints.	1
13674	A2VXSQHJWZAQGY	I got this for free and persevered enough to read 3 of the 4 stories. They honestly didn't feel like true romance and some were even a little depressing actually.	0
13675	A3B34HPHFZDODJ	Was not for me. I wanted a cookbook and not the who intro to the blogger and their submitted recipe. I deleated it. Glad I didn't pay for it.	1
13676	A333NNULJZP1AY	The lead character was unredeemably boring and the story lines were uninteresting and not believable.  The only credible relationship was the main character's bonding with her &#34;boyfriend's&#34; son.	0
13677	A2SIRIS6RTGB34	The writing style is rapid and lacks fluidity. Great plot but could benefit from more careful attention to detail. Love the characters.	1
13678	A1DQPMGS3XC6AN	I chose this rating because I really didn't enjoy the book and couldn't finish it.  I was just the wrong audience,.	1
13679	AGFLBA0XAJR8Z	I read a wide variety of stuff and I like anything that's well written. This book is not one of those things. Others may like it. I did not.	0
13680	A2BUUWV88RND8C	I have already deleted Sutton's way, it should not come up on my kindle. already went to the managing area to delete it.	0
13681	A1JJ52EY83US5B	The story plot was good. But I just didn't feel it, like I normally do. Like being in that person's shoes, or actually being there.	1
13682	A3GWYZQ3RDELC4	This storyline had good intentions, but I feel like it could have been written better. There were also too many exclamation (!) points throughout the story. It drove me crazy.	1
13683	A3P9D9ZYQS5MMZ	Dumb no storyline. Characters were boring.the only thing that was good was the love Tom had for Sarah. Don't waste your time.	1
13684	A13U38BET36ST0	This was a very boring book and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Even if it was free I would not read again.	0
13685	A2I6Z9AKM51CZI	I stopped reading after three chapters.  I just did not find this work to be engaging or interesting.  The story had too many odd unexplained events.	0
13686	AOVQ84PXF9EYZ	Spoiler: She just jumped into bed the first chance she got, just from seeing the man naked and hearing him calling her name. Story had no real umph to it.m.du	1
13687	A2RNLWK3J6ODCN	Nice first chapter killed like 15 minutes. Needs more that what it has dull and disappointing needs more to make it work	0
13688	A8E2WA18ERUI	I'm sorry but I've grown to expect a lot more alpha tendencies in Sam's books and Elijah seemed very lacking. Hope the next books are much better	1
13689	AIG0I95Q2H1GF	An F-bomb was dropped pretty early in the story.  I don't read things that include that particular word and try to find clean reads.  So I didn't finish it.	1
13690	A2JH2YC0NWC6MU	What a load of crap!!Don't know how this book got so many stars. Totally beyond me. I found it totally boring	0
13691	A1U0K3LF2ANALJ	You just might like this story.  It has everything thrown in but the kitchen sink.  Not really my cup of tea but other reviews indicate wide appeal.	0
13692	A1ENBKLZGXKRED	Love jasinda's other work, this isn't my favorite ever but is not completely terrible..I think I got it for free, who can complain about free?	1
13693	A1XG6VPBWYXWXE	The characters were off the wall. Violet seemed like a scatter brain. I just could not get into the story. Quit after 5 chapters.	0
13694	A3G03FGT0GJ0A9	This book is boring, poorly written and poorly edited.	1
13695	A3T4AYLZ9K0YYK	I was so disappointed with this. There were some good parts but those could have easily been added to book #3 saving readers several dollars.	1
13696	A15XQYHT2V1275	I could not even get through the first few chapters. I was so confused and it didn't get any better.	0
13697	ASO66E64JPNUK	did not find this book helpful at all.  I can do my own rahrah cheers.  I want tips for low fat, low calorie meal planning	1
13698	AXICH3O86MNUX	I have read and re- read this concept so many times. Just like the other Victorian &#34;Hunt&#34; stories, names and circumstances are different.	1
13699	A1YQ52RMHKOOSC	I did not care for this book. I couldn't get interested in it to begin with, so I didn't finish it. I will delete it soon.	0
13700	AZMMFZKJB8PV6	Unfortunately this book did not hold my attention and halfway through it i clicked out and moved on, sorry .Thank you .	1
13701	A1EIS6PXI6TRJT	It was right to the point. But,as far as a small story line, it needed a little bit more information.	1
13702	AVZ41UBCPF9OO	This is another story much like the other books with the same story line and theme. And it seems like ending too.	0
13703	A3564N8ULFJPTO	Not my cup of tea. Not very realistic. Sweet hmmmm I kept thinking really try frustrated hero and gag me with stick heroine.	1
13704	A1KU0TC2J73DMF	I hated the book and thought it should not be labeled a Christian book.  I would not recommend it if you like clean mysteries.	0
13705	AI07A11PUOGTZ	About halfway through the book I wanted it to just be over. I thought it was drawn out and it actually took me two tries to get through it.	0
13706	A3U1ORIAKU6WWF	Not worth at all. Wish I could get my money back. Yuck yuck yuck. Childish at best. Pass this one by	0
13707	AQYOTGM83AFXK	A waste of my money this book was so poorly written and it ended very stupid I want my money back!!!!	0
13708	A1OJ3G5TH883QS	This story starts out good then it goes to just violence.  It was a good beginning I just wish there was more.	1
13709	A3RG118D4XU2UN	I did not finish this book as I did not realise that it was a childrens, or at best a tweeny's adventure book.	0
13710	A4SNUKSJQFK3Y	For me this was just ok story.I don't have the urge to go buy the next part. Not saying it is bad. The story just didn't keep me interested.	1
13711	A28VV9S2NAVV8S	Several obvious edits need to be made.Good story but lacking originality.Could have given more detail and background to each main character.	1
13712	A3MSI4YLWOJNM4	It was just bad.  Badly written, the story line had potential, but somehow it just went off into the ditch.	0
13713	AA9VZCSXFGZSM	A novel is a complete story - beginning, middle and end. This book doesn't have an ending, it just stops. To call this book a novel is deceiving.	1
13714	A3OUOIHX3A34QV	The story nor the characters were believable.  Elizabeth was very angry for something that was very petty.  The angst was unnecessary.	1
13715	AKZT0YTIO9WUJ	If you are harrowing fan this may be your cup of tea but if you enjoy depth...do not waste your time	0
13716	A28UBGRX5D560I	Not at all what I thought it was going to be. It was good read but not scary. Some of the story's my girl's found funny	1
13717	A1YI8ILV6V4YVH	Sorry, just not good enough to take the trouble to write very much. Couldn't recommend it to anyone to be honest. Didn't like the cover artwork either.	1
13718	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	This story was waaayyyy to short. Not even worth the 99 cents I paid for it. Save your money & read something else.	0
13719	A1C3UGJF6YHLMV	this story was all over the place.........It started off well but the characters could have been developed better; short story.	1
13720	ARE2L71C2ECGP	So close to the 50 shades of grey books, at least it would help if the story line were to be original. Highly dissapointed.	0
13721	A317YD3C1B79LP	I just could not get into this book.  The development was so slow that I gave up after a few chapters. I could not recommend this book.	0
13722	AGH779X3GUUN9	Wasn't what I was expecting, I thought it was 40 days worth of prayers. I deleted it I didn't wanna read stories for 40 days	1
13723	A1QJ17BR5K3C8K	This book was ok it was short I hope that the next one is better than this one. I will read because I want to know what happened	1
13724	A2N8AHAHUPERAI	Book just brushes over a topic. A lot of expertise is already required.  Definitely not a beginner book.  Guess you get what you pay for here.	0
13725	A1HX2UIUMHVARZ	This book could have been much better had it had a quicker pace. It was a slow struggle to read.  I gave up after Chapter 3	1
13726	A25PN0244XJM7Y	I only read a few chapters.  If I wanted to read porn, I would just buy Playboy.  The characters were not realistic.	0
13727	A1PEWDXCUAIF6P	have deleted it.	0
13728	AT9TAULHMYMGS	A predictable plot that lacked imagination. I struggled to finish this one but kept hoping the story would improve. The final twist didn't do it for me.	1
13729	A16IMRPEALMMJD	Very sophomoric.  Not too interesting	0
13730	A34HOAP32OW0SY	This e book is  Not  what I expected. A few twist and turns. Their sex is ho hum at best. Author story.  Along with plot lines was the same.	0
13731	A1GKJH8FACQ4YY	The language in the first few pages was not what I prefer to read. The stories may be good, but I will not read the off-color language for fun.	0
13732	A2ZKDELYABRGRB	Even though I thought the storyline sounded interesting, I couldn't get past the first chapter because of the excessive use of predictable dialogue.	0
13733	AVWLL6WJPKVLT	What a disappointing story! Don't waste your time on this one.  It's not the full book just a snipit then you have to down load the rest of it	0
13734	A2M5HXUM4MCQQE	This book was boring and not going anywhere so I didn't even finish 4 chapters  Waste of time and effort.	0
13735	A2N8XI9PTDAC3K	Although the idea of this story was good, the book itself was a disappointment. It was slow, and the characters were not well developed	1
13736	A2FVY6I3C354RR	Rushed story line bad style and predictable good effort glad she took a chance but there is much work needed	0
13737	A1O79BLZSTP53I	This was just ok. I struggled to get into it. I just felt disconnected to the story. The writing style was alright but never grabbed my attention.	1
13738	A2RRQ8FKMKFKHY	Good story line, bad execution. This story has so much potential but it just fell short. There is not enough background story.	1
13739	AF43N9PXI79G3	Didn't try any of the uses.. But were good ideas. Didn't download until after christmas, but plan to user ideas next year	1
13740	A1K2I48ARXAWRK	Was not thrilledBoring did not understand this and thatDid not need cuss wordsAnd did not like it	0
13741	A29NB0MYA4EQXY	Very poorly written, both in typos, incorrect grammar, and story problems. There is a tiny bit of useful info, and the price was cheap, so I gave it 2 stars.	1
13742	A24GYW80U9G7Z9	I have no idea how this book got so many five star ratings. Poor plot, bad writing, and just boring. Glad I got it free and didn't pay for it.	0
13743	A32PYP772QZE4T	This presentation of the Grimm's Fairy Tales may have pretty pictures, but the translation is turgid and archaic. No wonder the book doesn't even say who the translator was!	0
13744	A3JB1KHA2QON2G	This is not as good as his usual books. A bit too science fiction & fantasy for me not my type of book.	1
13745	A24NR1Z5R91FEY	This is basically a repeat of Blood of Destiny, just told a little different from Kallen's side. Nothing new added	0
13746	A1YK3DC6S21DER	this book was nothing what i expected it was as though i was reading it in somekind code or something.	0
13747	A3F9RA0NGCV3K7	Here is a quote from this book; &#34;She was overpowered by dick lust and she grabbed it.&#34; You have been warned. *shakes head & mutters to self*	1
13748	A1YTQLQIYCFYJK	The storyline offers the promise of a great book. That promise however is destroyed by terrible grammar and inconsistencies. Please do us all a favor and seek an editor!	0
13749	ASQ3TTXMPGARQ	I found it rather insulting, however a novice to tech stuff may find some useful tips to help them out.	0
13750	A1JZFVP2PSQV6C	Not really a great read, two story neither really hitting the spot maybe it just wasn't the right book for me	1
13751	A1TVLBH7XEUS9T	Wanted info on more areas of interest as compared to previous books on kindle fire.  Very disappointed in this book.	1
13752	A1WIDTO69N3GCP	I never finished reading this, it just didn't keep my attention long enough. Pretty sure i got it for free, so at least that is a plus.	1
13753	A3V5YJJZI2G2NN	I haven't read this book yet hope to read it soon, it sounded interesting and I have a list I want to read love my Kindle	1
13754	AGORW02J2U6ON	I went ahead and bought this because at first she seemed sassy and fun,but no way.typical.As usual with books lately, she was self absorbed, immature and whiny.	1
13755	A3TMAY4C07JQVO	book would keep me in stitches.  However, it was at best mildly amusing but not something which made me laugh out loud.	1
13756	A35JJZBBB811E9	Not a good novel at all.  Characters not likeable and when the counsins 'shacked up' that was it for me.  Deleted off my Kindle.	0
13757	A3TNAAJ066E0I6	A.R Winters is an obvious fan of Janet Evanovich.  Her characters closely resemble those of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  Much too close.  Not the best attempts at humor.	1
13758	A3UOFUBJB7091Q	A supernatural school that seems to have it all. Another twist on vampire/human hybrids.  The story has potential but needs further development.	1
13759	A3ATDMWWSC89LV	SURRENDER AT DAWN is a very short story, timewise and length of tale.  It has danger, unfriendly interaction, some sex, and a mutual parting of ways.	1
13760	A15NZD5WINDQZM	in fairness i only read 20 percent of the book as it kept putting me to sleep and so i gave up	1
13761	A3RC9RHMXKWTRR	Missing from the beginning. So much more could have been said and done for this book. It is missing about half the plot.	0
13762	A2TMLXYCSP9IEI	It was short, story was a little bizarre but creative. I was a little lost at one point but it was an interesting short story.	1
13763	AORDRXJUKUNLH	Story was that of a short story, just didn't seem to be finished.  As if there was more that could have been written.	1
13764	A2HS7K379UG0G5	this was bought in error, i did not read so i could not tell you if i like it or not	0
13765	AKQI4EWEJI6OV	The book was to short for me but they were well written shorty stories would recommend if you like them	1
13766	A1PQ1WONMEYM0X	Thank goodness I only bought the introduction. That was bad enough. Definitely one for the &#34;do not buy&#34; list. Badly written, totally unbelievable rubbish.	0
13767	AVHRVXTNKPXCP	Same rehash of the same 30 or so standard slow cooker recipes. If you kept your slow cooker manual, you already have all of these.	0
13768	A2VPW6AUH2WJTG	We were disappointed that it was not the story of someone's new pet. It was about several different pets that people have had over time.	1
13769	A21A30O4IYPCGN	Maggie's bounty hunter started out great,but it lacked plot. it made me feel cheated out of what could of been a great love story.	1
13770	AWFW1Y8GL0SNP	I choose this rating because I didn't like this book. I disliked it because it had less information. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes video games.	0
13771	A331AEXEDG8EW9	Ok beginning. Not enough to make me purchase the next book in the series. Didn't get to see enough character development to care. Sex scenes were ok. Just ok	1
13772	A1AYGBTUQF7E8W	What a waste, it really had potential, but went nowhere!  You read expecting something and get unansweredquestions on the last few pages--good thing it was free.	0
13773	A36AUTZ88E7V0F	Somewhat implausible, which is acceptable for an escape from realism, but many of the elements were somewhat unpleasant, not a positive element to escapism.	1
13774	A8ATEKPFABSDD	I wouldn't recommend anyone to read this nor the other two to follow. The books will have you lost and confused. Honestly it's not even worth a star	0
13775	A19BJ98AAMGA9J	I felt for Wild but didn't quite like his &#34;old lady&#34;. The story peeked me interest enough to buy the next book.	1
13776	A2PGFYM8J0N46A	Not a good story line. Keep going back  to see if I missed something. Will not read this author again.	0
13777	A2ZOX31E1B1FB6	I had hoped for a greater selection of different types of apps.  This gave me no useful info at all.	0
13778	AZFOVV3U6VE2P	Good story but a small book	1
13779	A12WR6RHQAHBIW	This little book was weird.  I will not read it again.  Dean Koontz is a good writer.  But this one falls short.	1
13780	A21K9CF22PAGL5	SORRY I COULDN'T GET INTO THIS BOOK AT ALL.  I REALLY CANNOT PROPERLY RATE IT BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET PAST THE FIRST CHAPTER.	0
13781	A28DMVM1R0A3LM	Tool me forever to read this short book because it wasn't interesting or captivating in the slightest. Standard romance formula.	0
13782	A1ZS5FZ921G1EV	This book was entertaining but had typos and grammatical errors. The storyline was a bit unrealistic and overall not quite worth the $0.99 paid to read it.	1
13783	A3B3ODDZ59Y4II	This book is short yes but it could have been better without making the strip club a whore house. Disappointing.	0
13784	A22SPZZM9EX8BO	Te author is  a romantic writer in a fantasy world.  No resemblance to reality at all.  If you like romantic novels, you will love this series	1
13785	A1FMGA5AED6EE5	Yet another 15 page nonsense written by some poor ghost writer in the Philippines. Don't waste your money!	0
13786	A1NMLD5IJR2YYE	There are a lot of grammatical errors and not much of a story or characterization. BUT IF YOU LIKE Erotica, you,'ll like this. Not my cup of tea.	0
13787	A5OY5R73QUBED	I had really hard time to focus on the story,the book is hard to read and there is  no good flow therefore after few chapters I deleted it.	0
13788	A1A4QVX9RTCLVW	These protectors are not thick enough. They bubbled on me. I had my Samsung protectors for years without it doing that. You get two, but both did it.	1
13789	A1PVE8D7IZEZPI	Very basic stuff. Almost as if goggles and cut and pasted what was the first thing to pop up. .....	1
13790	A2RJYNYWB65WWG	Although it was an interesting beginning, didn't hold my interest. It is fine for a young adult /  teen read	1
13791	A1PH0SIPRL5J5Z	I had trouble finding the story line. I mean there's people interacting but I couldn't find much more than having no money and then having money.	1
13792	A1X6MD84APQVLO	"I was disappointed this wasn't longer. When I got to the end and found ""previews"" of other stories...I'm sorry I wasted $.99 cents on this story that went nowhere."	1
13793	A10ANCEOWK5GBN	Fun. I mean it's erotica, it's not going to be a super deep plot or characterization. Would recommend if you like reading this stuff.	0
13794	A1T72Z52TO7SLR	This was TERRIBLE. It made absolutely no sense, it was just a lot of ideas thrown together. I'm glad it was free!	0
13795	A32G78C5PHSRHA	Not really my type of story.  I could not settle into the storyline and just skipped to the end and I don't think I missed much...bleh..	1
13796	A1FZ3GSPZ2XM2N	This story suck. It is missing some real reasons for the actions taken. It needs more concrete reasons. I feel I wasted my time.	1
13797	A1LPS6RDS22D5N	Just another fad, crash diet. It may work in the short run, but is not sustainable, and not a healthy way to eat.	1
13798	A7W1T9CXHUCM	Good guys, bad guys, the impression that this is a patchwork of memes picked from other novels or sci-fi films, loosely knitted together, forgettable characters, forgettable narrative, un-sparkling dialogues.	1
13799	A1R9OKIXL3OUSP	It was a good book, just too short. Overall, a good book and will still read more from this author.	1
13800	AGNHYWO4AS0KU	Another Theory presented as to the Roswell mystery albeit not too well. Very short story with little or no editing. I really was hoping and expecting more.	1
13801	A3AY3YALNGT63M	Where Mistletoe Magic drew you in and gave you a very quick magical read, it was disappointing because it just ended.	1
13802	A3Q278JFRXRBOB	Umm no.., couldn't finish	0
13803	A10S049RIL1LY0	I looked forward to reading about Nikola Tesla. This is not the book for that. Its about other geniuses, inventors, etc.	1
13804	A14QSBQKADIRGO	Tried to read through this but it dragged and dragged so I finally just deleted it. Not enough plot or personality to engage anyone.	1
13805	A31OUO838IXVCC	This book wasn't what I thought it would be. I didn't enjoy it , the title was deceiving. I thought that it was a romance novel.	1
13806	A2QKG13HMR71Q2	Confusing as to characters, no context, not worth the 99 cents (plus tax) and Stuck with a Stiff wasn't memorable either.	1
13807	AHUWTLC984TNR	I'm still confused about the characters because the writing wasn't consistent. This needs work. The author needs to review her writing before throwing it out there. Not worth $2.99.	1
13808	A1Q7AW26RPL88U	Just thought it was too dumb to suggest to anyone else.  I asked my husband to read it and he had the same thoughts.	1
13809	AGORW02J2U6ON	The narrator's voice was simply too detached for me to make a connection. Flat characters and scenes that just didn't flow.	1
13810	A3AAMMQR4WIDI5	This was a super short read. I probably would have given this a higher rating had I been a guy.	1
13811	A2WPEJH5WQW6JK	I think there aS to much sex in the book. That's all there was . No real story.would not share it with others	0
13812	A1PSQJGV5RQK7S	Hoping for something fresh and new but it is now the same story again with new names but not so much as a new twist	1
13813	A3U7TAQCXOLO6W	Not one of my favorites, but not too bad.  Took awhile to finish it just dragged on and on sometimes.  Don't think I will continue the series :(	1
13814	AJJ01DX5PRKUU	THis was not the same quialty as others and I did not even finish it as it lacked the grace and poise I like .	1
13815	AAUJ332T3WR67	I guess there a folks who like these kind of stories.I found it a good read before going retiring for theevening.	1
13816	A2PR9ZNBHZMXE	i must have missed the male on male description, either was I did not enjoy this book at all. sorry	0
13817	A223RFO7ND5UWD	Ehhhh.....not as I remembered from my childhood.	1
13818	A39Y0VVO8YF19Z	Not enough in the book I needed more and the way it ended was typical Nico messing up  when is part 2 coming hopefully it's better	1
13819	ALPIN1ZX8B41M	This novella is very very similiar to another one of Maya Banks books.  I cannot remember the name, either way, doesn't matter.  Not really worth the time or energy.	1
13820	A24AE9S4FLDA5H	This is nothing like I thought it would be, I'm glad it was free.  I know I would not read it again.	1
13821	A1NYXNBP05FD8Y	too short... the characters werent developed before the story ended.	1
13822	A1I5MZ7V5AU95T	I gave this book 2 stars because just gave me a basis for salads in a jar and the recipe selections were not really for me.	1
13823	A1XX88SJ23WEOY	Just the beginning of Mac and Kalan.  It is very short.  If you like this series,  I think you will want to read this short story.	1
13824	A2P3LIKG2H56VD	Not well written at all. Typical sex scenes, no story or character development. Would think a girl could write about this stuff better.	1
13825	A1BQWDIEOZN3W9	Couldn't finish.  Too many grammatical errors!  Perhaps it got better but I could not keep reading it.  Do these books not have editors.	0
13826	A1FQ6CZILA7EQ2	Probably not worth the time you spend reading it . The information is available right from your Fire,much ado about nothing.	1
13827	ANUAJ3OMUH893	Read the free excerpt and then purchased the book, but I was disappointed. It seemed like a whole different book then how it started.	1
13828	A20MLP027RDS1T	i was looking for something new when i got this book, i really should have continued my search.not of a read for ME	1
13829	AYZQB1IDVQYKA	It started slow and continued endlessly.  I never really connected with the characters and felt the plot never went anywhere.	1
13830	A1S67VXI8CEQVO	seem slow and I wasn't interested in the characters. Maybe some other time I'll pick it up again and feel differently.	1
13831	A1AVCRY84JQKUX	I made it through the first story. Just barely. I don't understand the necessity for the racial stereotypes. I've read better and I'm glad this was free.	0
13832	AL9EIC4OFHRP2	Cute, but the pacing is a little off. It's a strange mix of fantasy and steampunk that just didn't quite work for me.	1
13833	A2ZN55YFFC3UQM	Michael, it is time to cut down on the length of your novels, too many books in the same story tend to make reading stale.	0
13834	A26EZBMJHVHOSC	had this been a script, the story could have worked better, but it was a story instead and such it was very poorly written and told.	0
13835	A3TYWLLZGB1EDR	Instant attraction. Instant lust. No reaction to being ripped from the streets to be raped, and bred. Lousy dialogue. Werewolves. Sort of. Humans. Not quite.Good premise, though.Thankfully short.	0
13836	A1HAZ6H0OOM5VZ	Really? In the face of life threatening, flight or fight moments, our internal dialogue is admiring someones ass, bulges in tee shirts or pants?	0
13837	A3UTQQXJFZOMKN	There were just blank pages after one recipe.  Extremely disappointed, was looking forward to  some tasty dishes for my freezer.	0
13838	AJ6NMC9P07O5S	Couldn't see the importance of the relationship between them. Would have been better if the author developed the main characters relationship beyond the physical. Love scenes were boring and quick.	1
13839	A3BZWHJRLO42ST	I found this book to be a rambling story and it was a lot of filler to make a weak story.	1
13840	APC3Y3FVB34ST	I read about 25% of this book and just couldn't get into it. The story didn't flow for me and I gave up.	1
13841	A1WI0R8QOMP12P	I knew it was a short story going into it but it was too much too soon for a erotic book.	1
13842	A5V9K2ZQNRME2	Very, very basic. There is a huge lack of original ideas or tips. I'm not even sure a newlywed moving into their first home would benefit much from this book.	1
13843	A27FUC0EH0PRQD	I liked the idea, but it became smutty.  I thought this would be a clean read, so sad good authors with good ideas ruin books with porn.	0
13844	A2IOZ6UYTUSUV3	This was done because he visited Amazon in TN. I really didn't read it as most of it was on TV.	0
13845	A2VW4FSYEDWAD	Got halfway through the book and finally put it in archives.  The story was way to predictable, I lost interest.	1
13846	A34X9CGJCEE5Q5	This was a very boring book not much to it, would not recommend this book unless you like boring romance.	0
13847	A1RN93FCV9O6CK	This is a very short predictable story with no surprises or intrigue.  I got it for free but I would not recommend it.	1
13848	A6SR7U2PNGN0N	This story was not my cup of tea, because it was not the way the plot was going to like I thought.	1
13849	A1AVMV6L6ARGFG	This isn't a good story.  I didn't like this story at all. This story didn't make any sense so I stopped reading it.	0
13850	A75RG7QXRCPCU	I thought this book was ok.  Not much else to say.  I wish I could even say what i did not like but this book was forgettable for me.	1
13851	A1ZOE9J3OPTQFE	I like the book is was definitely different I'll have to get the next one.Thank you Ruby Miller I'd try it out.	1
13852	A1OQNNY3RZNKGV	Not even the most craven homophobe would enjoy this tale, it is childishly done and  totally inappropriate for an intelligent mind	0
13853	A39TQHDTMJFEFH	Suspending one's disbelief is an utter necessity with this book.  There is a lot to disbelieve.  That's an okay requirement IF you're not constantly reminded how ridiculous the book is.	0
13854	A373ZJ6943ZVA8	Disappointed in the intensity and real Reacher style. I missed the attitude. Not a Jack Reacher novel. Will not follow up on further novels.	1
13855	AY0CFQJYJYPB9	Everything happened too fast with no background stories to flesh out the characters.  I liked the plot description when I bought it, thank goodness it was free.	0
13856	AKD3H4TY6C8D0	This was not my type of book. I actually didn't read a lot of it because I don't like this type of stories.	0
13857	A1LVNJW6044JOD	Book would have been better without the whole &#34;intimate&#34; family thing!  Could not bring my self to buy the second book in this series.	0
13858	A27WVS7N7SVMQ0	A short story with not much of a  plot to to hold the reader's interest. I finished it, but when I put it down, I just said to myself, ho-hum.	1
13859	A2OAJX7CMKHOSD	I ordered this book and the second one because they seemed interesting being written by the crimina...they both weren't worth the money inspent	0
13860	A2N484P77PUSPM	Was not impressed with this sequel it left a lot to be desired.  Sorry I read it will pay more attention to did not like reviews	1
13861	AKKKYKW4Z30M1	There is no table of Continent and it is more difficult to navigate than any other Bible that I have on my Kindle.	1
13862	A2C1AZGM3GCZUV	If you want to read about sex and bondage, well this is whst you want to read. If you want to read a story with a plot, this ain't it	0
13863	A8K4YA1E3OE32	Sad and at times depressing.  Austen books usually entertain and teach the reader.  This story line left me empty compared with others Ihave read.	1
13864	A3W039PLNCWKRY	Boring.  Skip it.	0
13865	A2P4GIYPG2CVVN	I just did not care for the book. I could not get into it. I tried, but it was a little too slow.	0
13866	A2UR06TAQKFIG5	Loved My Nights with Kate but gotta say this one fell short for me....  Came across kinda cheesy to me and I just couldn't get into it.	1
13867	A4XBWFEC32ES6	It's short and way too much thinking and pondering. I skipped most of the last quarter of the book because of it. I think this book was free, thankfully.	1
13868	AG2V7FMENH1Z6	Because of the end very disappointing was not aware that it was a short terrible ending book. Really??? Would like to know what happened with them.	0
13869	A3QNRKLE3DHLKX	Ian Irvine again ~ sorry but no I won't be bribed into buying part 2!!!!!! Sad that any author should agree to this type of business	0
13870	A3KUG4Y7V9H4B9	Not my type of book. Plenty of foul language and crude sexual innuendos.Will not be reading the last two books of the trilogy.	0
13871	A3MYVXDQEHCPKF	They repeated themselves a lot, told us things we already knew, and over all weren't that much help. Not impressed.	1
13872	A12UDATYZEMM20	Read it within an hour, not much to review as it was over before the story had begun. Rip off!	0
13873	A2UFJC04MZTQAX	Very light read. Pleasant to read but very light. Not much substance but light entertainment and easy readingNot for the gutsy reader..	1

13875	A12K5Y2SEANYW0	This was not what I thought it would be, nor did it follow any sensible path, therefore I did not finish the story.	1
13876	A34FKMV6SWUBPH	It is a kids book you wood think there would  be something redamble but no it was bad just bad	0
13877	A2PDAT5MVMN326	Didn't realize this was the 'teaser' to the entire book.  Had an exceptional beginning - but was left standing without an ending.	0
13878	A10DX2CTHA4GRU	I don't like this. I consider those spankings abuse. Too much for my taste. Less is better.  Otherwise a good book.	1
13879	A1A0OBUWMLUKNG	Not very interesting to me, so I couldn't get into the story and never could read very much.  I Just stopped reading and picked up another book.	1
13880	A3HOA380TKCYWF	Very hard to keep track, was boring and no plot. I will not recommend this read to anyone. Please do not purchase	0
13881	A34V74W6RSUR7J	This book kept me on my toes from beginning to end...excellent book!!!!!!!!!!!! This author is off the chain!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Always does the job!!!!!	1
13882	AD20B29YQDZYQ	Had so much promise but the book rapidly tanked.  Too bad really.  So much potential.  I would pass on it.	0
13883	A2H19TYZFH5RGY	I want the time back I wasted on this extremely boring silly excuse called a book. Not worth buying very glad it was a freebie  .	0

13885	A2IS4MCXAE8E6X	I like Catherine Byrne.that's why I picked this book. I didn't know it was a werewolf story. I will read more reviews next time. I did finish the book though.	1
13886	A26MCQ8LJDRB3J	This is not a book nor a finished story.  This is a cheat designed to get you to buy the book.	0
13887	A343Y6PAFSKKYM	A total waste of time.  Just a bunch of obvious dribble to fill pages. Really, who doesn't know how to masturbate? If it feels good...do it!	0
13888	A2LMF4HG470CNF	We knew Joseph was awful. To pay money to see how awful wasn't necessary. The story do don't move us forward - it only made us more ill.	0
13889	A1U45ZC4N2B7XZ	It was very boring, I didn't enjoy it.  Too predictable, I would not recommend.  Just wasn't what I expected it to be.	0
13890	A3I0HJL85GA7X0	Not sure why this would be listed under Christian. More evil darkness than good. Not that good of a read to me.	1
13891	A3KUVJQFNNKDA6	Way too short. There was no story and the book ended too soon. I would have liked to see the story continue with a little romance and detail	1
13892	A162VMYK5AAJZX	This is ok if you like this type of book. It just wasn't my thing. Nothing against the writer or the story.	1
13893	A3BKV9ZKRVMKWW	very boring need to come to the point quicker not interest at all beginning to add up to the end	0
13894	A22TQE24Y2HAIR	It was a very short read...I found it difficult to connect with the characters. This my first Laura Cooper read, maybe others are better.	1
13895	ANRWUARV66LWQ	Although I enjoyed the story the grammatical errorsWas very distracting....author needs an editor.Or at least a teacher or someone to proofread for her.	1
13896	A1RAT2F4TCZA3E	This book just rambled on and really didn't tell a story. I don't think I will read anything else she writes.	0
13897	A1P6FPUE0T9I5T	Is this really for a youth reader?  I never hooked me in.  It seemed dull never getting anywhere.  Sorry I didn't get it.	1
13898	AX529SEU0E051	I started this book but doubt I will ever finish it. It's just plain bad - poorly written, no discernable plot and boring, boring, boring.	0
13899	A2LWJZVF9DS7H5	I would say whoever edited this book should probably reconsider their career. the book itself is pretty predictable and not a great suspense.	0
13900	A1UCGBDNHGKNCP	Romance, long lost love denied because of a tragedy in the past. The answer is a threesome, makes the story interesting.	1
13901	A2BHEPYIDR182L	I wanted to like it,but it was just too boring. I should have been written better,with better flow. Got a refund.	1
13902	A14XCEQVA119WV	Very erotic and that's about it (and not very good erotica either), lust and love are very different, there's no love here.	1
13903	A2QD1N3R1UW7KU	Definitely not the best book I've ever read.  Would have been more interesting if the writing column had been left out.  Too much jumping from one topic to another.	1
13904	A36JELIH955MWD	short and not worth it that it would be sweet and fun but it didn't really mean much. there are better books out there	0
13905	A33UJC53W5BJPR	I did not order this book! and would not spend money on this type of book.  End of this review	1
13906	A1EVY3RDX8GXCL	Not a survival story, Just a few hours before being found.  Disappointing.  Spent a lot of the book bragging about his drug use.	1
13907	A2HBMN6Y5N41QW	I was hoping for a great story, but it never happened.  I didn't finish this book because it took too long for the plot to develop.	1
13908	A3DKATZ60E2M0T	I started reading this but it just didn't do it for me.  It felt...I cant explain it.  Maybe this was their first book?  I couldn't finish it.	1
13909	A2QKVEN8EX5WD2	The story seemed very simple minded at times, going on in cliches and nonsense.Characters aren't really believable, and the plot was ridiculous.	1
13910	A9PF3Z54EB4YC	The author would greatly benefit from classes and workshops before attempting to pub another book. Also should consider an editor.	0
13911	A2EKSOLTKBGWTK	"Book is O.K.I am reviewing because this comes up under ""Childrens Stories""?I believe Amazon should have an age setting (my daughter is 6) to make this catagory more appropriate."	1
13912	A15T45VLAFQVTD	I really didn't care for this story in fact I didn't finish it.  The writing style wasn't good and I didn't like the characters	0
13913	A3GDKIBWJZWM36	Looks like a potential good read. The book is 153 pages and is 4.99. Seriously...., 4.99 for not even a full book?  No thanks.	0
13914	AJHTEJKFK6HZW	Nothing like fifty shades at all it was more of STALKER much. I also figured out her big secret  by end of first short book.	1
13915	ALHM275M0FKYP	"This ""prequel"" is no such thing it is just a chapter or so from the full book from a slightly different view point and doesn't even follow the story correctly."	0
13916	A2UHPYO7GN7KFV	It was an okay book a little boring but good recommended  for age group 12-14  the ending of the book was pretty good	1
13917	A24S19G1YGH0FY	Good plot.  needs to be filled out more, more complexity, more detail. With work this could be a really great book.	1
13918	AU1E976Q40EYJ	Cuddly romance needed to be drawn out a whole lot more.maybe more build up before really placing the call to her.	1
13919	A2N3G22USXWRT8	Compared to beautiful thin or whatever, not much was a bit bored and wanted it to end halfway through. A bit funny in some parts though.	1
13920	AJRYPPA566O8I	This could have been a much better story if more of the story would have been expanded on. Book is ok but could have been better	1
13921	AG5WTGV9XWXBM	I liked this books style but felt the writing could use some streaming up. The ending was lame. The engagement was unnecessary but the reconnect with Heath was cute.	1
13922	A1YQ1FCM5JRS1M	Gage is a piece of s*** & Kayla is an idiotThat is not love at allThese are the worst books I've ever read	0
13923	AJN59DT6L5TLQ	Too predictable.As the author says in the beginning, This wasn't accepted for publication  when first  written and probably should not have been at all.'	1
13924	A28E0GLT066V8E	Could use help in the innovative thought processes.  Some Vampire stories sex scenes are much better written.  Cover art was sexiest part of the book.	0
13925	A1A8X70KQQ4T1T	Whats to say? more junk literature and not much help in a real life situation. Just didn't care for it.	1
13926	A356K1MI6WSXPS	i was intrigued by the titled.  i was intrigued by the preface. the story really did stink.  the killer stunk more.	1
13927	A3GUF8HV1M9Q33	This is a short story not a book. While it might be interesting, selling it as a book is disengenious and a waste of money.	0
13928	A14AMX0ULLEN1G	If this book wasn't free I wouldn't have read it.  I couldn't connect with any of the characters especially the main character.	1
13929	A350FKSZ6JD3AY	Two stars the best I could give this book. The only reson I finished this boo is because I paid for it.	1
13930	A2AB80GT8OLR4W	It took me a long time to finish this book. It was an ok story, not near as good as her other ones. It was hard keeping my attention.	1
13931	A3798UU0L5DCM7	First few books were great this one gets harder and harder to keep reading. to much time on the main characters mental break down.	1
13932	A3HO302JT2N85Q	Some words of advice for all aspiring authors: If you won't bother to edit out numerous errors, I won't bother to read it.	0
13933	A21RF3DDGLD40Y	It's okay I guess	1
13934	AKK7D0330MGO7	I hope I didn't pay for this book. Poorly written.  Terrible plot. Unlike able characters. Sometimes I couldn't even figure out where people was when they starting talking.	1
13935	A1CHBNT96KKZR0	Lacked Character development.  I couldn't get emotionally attached to it.  Wanted more....sexual exploration, reasons for marriage.  Just needed more.  Too trite!	1
13936	A2NN2T8Z97SZ8I	These stories needed a good editor = major inconsistencies with character development and plot. A tough read getting through the errors.	0
13937	AC60HVSSKPWEB	This book is ok it is very graphic and leave s not much for your imagination.  I did read the book pretty quickly.	1
13938	A3ISLJLMCU94FV	The poor grammar does not add to the story or the authenticity of the main character. In fact, I find it rather insulting.	1
13939	AA5QBTB1IXWSY	Save your money, don't bother.  I expected more from Baldacci.There is little more for me to add about this book.	0
13940	ANUAJ3OMUH893	A little uninspired story that I did not really find interest in. I've read Christie before, but never the Pyne character. Maybe I just started with the wrong story.	1
13941	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	Do not enjoy books that are boring. Disappointed in this one, it looked good, but isn't at all! Don't waste your heard earned money!	0
13942	A2P8NDKGLZE3YW	She tells all in the preview of the book.  Then the book describes in detail.  No surprises.  Too sad for me to read after I know what to expect!	1
13943	A1BHX6GZYHAV9U	I am unable to even finish this book, it's just so clunky, poorly written and poorly edited.  Wow!  Good thing it was free.	0
13944	A3MZSN527JJ5QI	I didn't find the characters particularly interesting in this book.  The book didn't capture or keep my attention nor my imagination.	1
13945	AXW0PWCB9D251	This was a stupid story..thank God it was only a 10 min  read...has a good story line but needs more thought into it..	0
13946	A1KADAOKG5WWTR	This book gives only some very general information, one specific recipe, and really has no value for someone seriously looking for practical advice.	1
13947	A1EH9IG8KRABXN	The very beginning of this short story was well done. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the rest of the story did not fulfill the early promise. Deleted from my archives.	1
13948	A23WEMR6HY38W2	Just couldn't get into this book. By chapter 5 or so gave up. Just not interesting enough to stay with it.	0
13949	A9TJDMW692OCU	was equally non significant and really a waste of a book, just as bad as the first one (or vice versa?)	1
13950	A1IO64VZRGWRUI	No words, no time, no interest, and I don't like kindle, anyway, or having to write a stupid review for  absolutely EVERYTHING	0

13953	A3A05QCWDVJF1E	there is no possible excuse to Not proofread and edit this drivel. &#34;Teutonic Plates&#34;?Why bother? This man is no writer. It is an insult.	0
13954	A1NFCWB9BURNM2	I misunderstood the description. This ebook only has the Book of Matthew from the New Testament.	1
13955	A32ZKSH0HK1K2F	I'm not sure what I expected, but I didn't get it.  Extremely short, very formulaic. It was very disappointing to me.	1
13956	A1FWVYPBW0HG2I	I started reading this but stopped after a few chapters. I couldn't tell you why but it just doesn't hold my interest. Maybe I'll try it again another time.	1
13957	A356RIL6BIUGHK	Found myself just flipping through. I did not even finish this book.I expected a better story, spicer maybe, somehow did not wheel me in!	1
13958	A2MUGF5KD2L2B7	this app for my kindle fire was okay but it wasn't for me. the story was ok and interesting but there was too much smut for my taste.	1
13959	A206LLY9XAVZWR	Not my kind of Jokes. Title misleading.  I expected the jokes to be funnier. I removed it from my Kindle.	1

13961	A26W9M7XK0U85A	Downloaded only to find out in order to read the magazine I had to buy it. Don't say free unless you mean it. Deleted it from my Kindle.	0
13962	A2HBOZK1SO4A6M	I think this book was to hard core for me. It was just a lot of people having sex nasty	0
13963	A254U7JJ578KF8	I found it very hard to read. It didn't keep my attention like I thought it might. It could be me .	1
13964	A3MZF65ZEW1VV5	I did not finish this because I lost interest very quickly. It was slow paced and I couldn't bring myself to finish it.	1
13965	A2PLWP269C9DF6	There was no plot.  There were too many characters to follow. Some of the storyline was believable but blown to the 10th power.  This just wasn't for me.	1
13966	A2A8DFY2Y6T1PA	I didn't like the way she treated Kane. I felt like she was only using him and he deserved better.	1
13967	A3H562YGOWSDI	I read the entire book and it was not bad but it was not the story that I thought it was.	1

13972	AJXY5026F3N3N	I guess I'm not a Sherlock Holmes fan.  I really didn't care for this book.  If you enjoy mysteries, you'd probably like  it though.	1
13973	ALZHWI9G814KA	Exciting at the beginning but got too far fetched.I'm a Christian but this was too much.I confess I didn't even finish it.	1
13974	A27GC533M5PSJW	No passion, sounds like a horny teenager wrote it. He raped her and she allowed him to. Needs a lot more detail and information. It sucked.	0
13975	A32GCVUCYYORME	nothing really wrong with the book, I just couldnt get into the book. It just didnt capture my interest within the first few chapters.	0
13976	A3UBCYKE00HKQN	Did not like the book;  regret downloading the book; would not recommend the book; and a complete waste of my time...simply stated:  pure political propaganda and disgusting content.	0
13977	A2BL4B2DKBUKF2	Not really what I Was looking for. Not the inspirational material I was hoping it would be. Might help to catorigize your motives if you are in doubt.	0

13981	AKYZ3ZGKG5K9D	This was a story?  I am sitting here, dazed and wondering what it was.  Did I say weird?  It was that and something more, but I haven't yet decided what!!!!!!	0
13982	A31S8ME48HYF9L	dumb story line nothing exciting to draw a person to want to finish reading this book. I strongly suggest not to buy this book	0
13983	A5NQLAJLUBLA1	Kinda hard to keep up with who is who and not really much of a plot.  All in all mostly a waste of time to me	1
13984	A2WJY2CMB5NHVZ	It was FREE.That about sums it up.If your a guy who wants to read about having sex with multiple women, this is the story for you.	0
13985	A1T8MJ71STPPC0	Silly. Laborious - not a good read.  Hard to get into and stay focussed.  Not recommending this author.  Not a good buy	0
13986	A2W1E2JYR4540G	This book gives you the same stuff all the others like this do. Was nothing new to really read about	1
13987	A3QRH5R1RXXHOH	As short stories go it was OK but the ending was very weak in my opinion.  I wish Child had developed the story further into a full book.	1
13988	ATHD9KHUGV12Z	Very disappointed in this book.  Hard to make myself read the whole book.  Can't recommend this book.  Don't waste your money.	1
13989	A190IDZ5VTUHJM	I loved the first book but this one lost all its steam.  It had potential but it could make it happen	0
13990	A2499RZFTT64Z9	Was relieved when it ended. Yet I still have to write another few words. I was going to say nothing, but this request to comment came via email.	1
13991	A18O9A44NSD4K7	Had a difficult time getting and staying interested in this story.  Not my cup of tea, too many fantastical beings.	1
13992	A1VRZ4K6PJZQ07	I want a full book; not a clip of one. I am tired of authors splitting their book up and not having resolution.	1
13993	A1X8YI8EKM8YRA	I just did not get it. To me this book made absolutely no sense what so ever. Did I miss something?	0
13994	A2WX2VCZ1MU5WK	Maybe it is just me but I find this very hard to navigate. When it comes to a Thesaurus, I will stick with paper.	0
13995	A26W9M7XK0U85A	Predictable. Was glad it was not any longer than it was. Thankfully it was free. Would have been a waste of money otherwise.	1
13996	A13BKDOO4M5ZRB	Biggest waste, i mean wasted of my time, i mean my mind not to whisper money,, u know mullah or greens	0
13997	A14ZEGY2GDYZWD	I loved the first 2 books in this series, but I was disappointed in the direction this one took.  I can't help but root for Johnathan!	1
13998	A33ORAQ6NYZBA	I thought that all the recipes listed were in this book. Not so you receive some cake,cupcake and truffle recipes.	0
13999	A35LBI5EE15ETV	There was so much blah, blah, blah and common sense deductions I didn't even care to read the recipies. I kept thinking really?  Would recommend for a pre-teen's consumption	0
14000	A2LHL3RYUYLCN8	Mildly entertaining, but a mess. Three characters names Jake, back and forth between the 19th century and today and a incredible, as in unbelievable, ending.	1
14001	AXJOK8KXSBUKK	I'm sorry but the plot was weak and was not worth the money I paid for it.Save your money	0
14002	A3FICFRS7CF5II	Connor is the worst. I'm surprised that I seem to be the only one who has a problem with him. Belittling her about her job........sickening.	0
14003	A2LCGE9XD29IJ8	This never got off the ground for me. Both main characters were flat. This is a semi YA. Struggled to make it half way through.	1
14004	A32QMCHPYLK8QW	...I only genuinely laughed at about 20 of the jokes. I thought that maybe the jokes will be more Facebook-specific, but most of the jokes are found everywhere else.	1
14005	A1JCVLU1YXKNRA	Terribly written.  Terribly edited. Completely unbelievable.  Total waste of money.  Repetitious sex scenes (which is all the book basically was).  Stupid...stupid...stupid!!!!!	0
14006	A3QBDVJULWSYVW	Are u serious it is getting to be ridiculous and crazy everyone is dropping dead even the police is being used as well come on are u serious.	1
14007	AQAS1MX0EG5J2	It was a slow read.. It ended crazy.. I'm glad that it was free and that it didn't have a second book..	1
14008	A1G3XQ9MCU9KXU	this book was honestly terrible. Poorly written and completely forgettable. I don't think there was any story line worth reading. Save your money and move on.	0
14009	A3O6MS0D8AWNZ7	I am a John Grisham fan but was very disappointed in this story.  Left me wishing I hadn't read it.	0
14010	A1FWMW42ZN7TX	I downloaded this anthology so I could sample new authors. I did not find any that personally appealed to me. The stories are really quite dark to downright gruesome.	1
14011	A3JE3PLS4FYIS	I didn't like this at all I felt as though you weren't able to truly get to know the character	0
14012	A29SU4SY820B9D	The story plot sounded good but was so dragged out it didn't hold my interest.  I'm so sorry.  Spoiler totally bad ending.	1
14013	A1MAX2T31XVX03	there was nothing about the charecters or plot I found remotely entertaining. Don't waste your time and hopefully the hourglass will run out. Glass half empty on this one.	0
14014	A2MO5M17T6W83X	The book just basically listed the sites..did not say if author tried the sites and made money. Nothing special in my opinion.	1
14015	A35NC9FMG7FCU	I could never understand the plot to this book.  As a SEAL fan, and one who's written 3 books about SEALs, it's unbelievable to me.	0
14016	A3HA4AIV9DIY1R	I Really didnt like this book... it wasn't my cup of tea. I wouldn't tell anyone to read it.  Z	0
14017	A1H58I96123UAS	I don't like the idea of serial novels featuring the same tired charachters. If new ones are introduced with first characters in the background it would be more interesting.	1
14018	A1HW0WEB1LNLV3	This reads as if it was writing by younger author, it was also highly predictable. Nothing really outstanding about it.	1
14019	AHCOZGZ9LWAGO	The female seemed very juvenile and the male very unsure. Did not like this bookHope the author improve in subsequent books.Will be returning book	0
14020	A2OFQ74YWFFWC8	By the time you figure out what is going on in this book it is over. The second one is just as short.	1
14021	A3J8BKYJUF77U5	It is hard to read a book in a first person set up.  I like a book which draws you into the story.  To me, the characters don't develop quickly.	1
14022	A1N06EKVN7PP5Z	Couldn't really get into this book. I didn't even make it halfway through it before I decided to stop torturing myself.	1
14023	A36LFO7BF1DH92	Though tense and thought provoking, I found the story a bit to short. With a bit more development it could be a good story.	1
14024	A2DYA33FR9XGYL	I'll withhold my opinion until after I finish the book. Which may take awhile.I'm having a problem getting past page one.	0
14025	A2O4TTVDSVHFOG	Took me about 15 minutes to read. I agree with the reviewer who said its the 1st chapter of a good novel. At least it's priced right.	1
14026	AP8VWJNGMUPZ0	If you are looking for something quirky, this is it. The characters do not have much depth and a whole lotta baggage. The plus is that it was unpredictable.	1
14027	A4WHQ3T8EUU1L	This is no better than the other so it will not get any more of my money. The hope is the author will develop.	0
14028	A21OFMU4ID0USM	Kind of a stupid book, but it passed the time. I will probably not read any more books by the author.	0
14029	A1LHXNN8TGBY0Q	Only read this because l wanted to be prepared to discuss it intelligently.  Pure propaganda.  Will be hesitant to recommend it.	1
14030	A3KQDCFLA7ACQE	Poorly written, I like crime fiction and am used to violence but this was awful and overboard. I was quickly bored and couldn't even get to the third chapter.	0
14031	A3JWV2T9M1EG3H	This was a simple story, not much to it.  I hated the sex part and would not recommend this to anyone.  A mystery does not need sex to be good.	1
14032	A38UQSQ0CCJN6K	Just average speed, expected it to be faster from the way it was advertised.  That said, it is better than no charger than  at all.	0
14033	A2FXT42ESL0QA5	this is so predictable and except for the names of the main characters and the author, it's the same story as My Defiant Fiancee.	1
14034	A3CNWYFJPBXT2N	I didn't like this storyIt wasn't a storyIt was all about cruel sexShe was with a stranger and let him do anything	0
14035	A3KWLE7H7QYUOJ	things for guys to chomp on while watching tv sports or playingcards. nothing really unique offered. albout what you could come up withon your own.	1
14036	A2I6BB8R7L2R4L	This was just plain awful. Downloaded it for free but will be deleting it off my cloud. And apparently this is a series? Who pays for this stuff?	0
14037	A3CQJZ8ZA8RFPL	this could have been any detective short,very short, story.  there was none of the character of Rutledge at all.  waste of money	0
14038	A1BY4NLRFSDLKS	This book was not a very direct view of God. Many of the stories were dark rather than positive. I was disappointed.	1
14039	A2JA23ASSRCYH1	Was a sweet story but was over to quickly. 60% into the ebook and the story was over. Should be advertised as a short story!	0
14040	AA2EV7INCX78X	Please see my review of the entire Turbulence series in &#34;Turbulence 7:  Radio Silence&#34;.  In short, this series is a crashing disaster (pun intended).	1
14041	A5RX8JTDW08PT	It seems like all it is is meeting the opposite sex and hopping into bed.I dont read this kind of book	0
14042	A38CDA01D3C6FH	I wanted simple and this was a long drawn out history - just not what I was looking for at the time.	0
14043	A35DLEU7FTK83H	Ugh. I got it because it was a sequel, and I wasn't thrilled with the first. I had to put this one down half way through. God awful.	0
14044	A3JAUBU55BLJSY	first time reading this author.  He is too hard core for my tastes.  I won't buy another book from him.	1
14045	A332G12IN7RNHE	So unrealistic!  Could not keep up with the true character of the book at any real time. Also a little to sadistic for me.	1
14046	ABECGT9AOX5X5	I have other Feng Shui books, and this one seems too simple and at times, it contradicts the other information.	1
14047	ALQGOMOY1F5X9	Boring and did not keep my attention in the least! Hate books that don't! Really thought it was a waste of money!	0
14048	A3K4Z5R20ZKVNF	It was really boring, I wasn't interested in the love story at all. It says it's &#34;a sweet, contemporary romance&#34; - I guess it was too sweet for my taste.	1
14049	A1J9DRPXY9ME8Q	An interesting concept but poorly executed. The storyline is familiar enough (Think: Aliens)but the writing style, plodding. Worse, the editing is atrocious  e.g., ''their safe'' and ''your right''.	1
14050	A1XGH28T5YAFSX	i was disappointed in this book. Very short & hardly any new information. I was hoping for more insight I to each guys pov. Too similar to the first book.	1
14051	A26U9W79S8WA63	It is excerpts. From other books. It is. Just alright . It is too bad that that wasn't made clear.	0
14052	A28IW5BS6GEO3Y	Save your money and your time (or waste them elsewhere).  This is just the standard old drivel re-packaged.  Not worth your time or money.	0
14053	A3UU1RDA1GB1V6	I did not like the ending.  It left you up in the air. I thought something could have been added to the story.	1
14054	ARAJXGCQAW6HD	I like romance novels, but I don't like novels that gives descriptions like I'm reading porn. If you like descriptive sex scenes, you will like this book	1
14055	A1R80I3FS4UKPA	My daughter wouldn't sit through this book and she is 3 years old.  Maybe an older child would like this.	0
14056	A1ZN1MTMY2DK7J	I waited a long time for this sequel and still Jaime and Remy don&#8216;t  end up together.  Y not?  I would like a HEA,	1
14057	A1FI3UX24TRLVH	The base story line was disturbing at best and disgusting overall. Unlikable characters, questionable ideals, not worth the download! Overall don't waste your time.	0
14058	A27QLU2S5VT6LI	This books is about 4,000 words. A nice love story with ups and downs, but I feel that it started and ended way to quickly.	1
14059	A1WVJ0XNKZR0Y3	"Narrative is beautiful.  Story well thought out.  Ingenious setting.  The only naughty thing is the ending.  I don't get ""it.""  Shall look online if the author has other books."	1
14060	A1GHV20HSBV5Z	A very short story about BDSM, but pretty good anyway,with a bit of a twist in the end,by the wife.	1
14061	A1FC1O32GWOYFZ	To be fair it is a novella..... but, the characters we're not developed, the story was ok. Overall it was simply.... eh.	1
14062	A3DSYHA7P7CYA4	It was kind of boring and slow.  Detail were in the book that were not really necessary to the store,  I was disappointed.	1
14063	A2FSBGV74SWAQK	Save it for later when there id nothing else good to read, it as so predictable and one can basically write the ending	0
14064	AVWLL6WJPKVLT	Very lame.  I Won't download another even if they are freebees.  Very very lame . . . . . .	0
14065	A8G4IH5994DOV	Could not get into this book so only read half before putting it to sleep.Light reading but did not grab me.	0
14066	A2J7RBEAOTT2J0	I know it was a short story, but it was short on plot and character development. Light and easy to read.	1
14067	A31DM4NZ9G60YD	I expected romance, I expected the characters to have depth and I received nothing! This is one of the most horribly written and conceived series.	0
14068	A16YOJJNSXIVLV	This book was aimed at children more than adults. Perhaps 12 to 14 yr olds.  I would have liked to see a disclaimer about that befor I bought.	1
14069	A1FMST0KODWBU4	Tiresome boring and just plain not worth the time it takes to read it. There are better books out there folks keep looking!	0
14070	APITHXHWG0D4Q	this book was something and read and asked myself really? I kepted hoping it would get better. total waste of time.	1

14074	AVME21TX56BSW	This was so badly written in was pathetic!The &#34;book&#34; was read from start to finish in about 20 minutes.  Sorry I wasted my money on this one	0
14075	A18JHVX925K101	This was far too short to develop a 'relationship' with the story.  I liked the idea, saw potential for more for this horror story about what happens after death.	1
14076	AL0URJ8F78NQ2	It is like the author took three or four different stories and just smashed them all together to make one.  Would have been mi	1
14077	A31XW1RTQ4ZG9W	This was not worth a read so I closed it up early on and started reading something better..I would not recommend this to anyone I know.,.	1
14078	A3SQHJP1ODGLS0	it was a waste of money.  i did not like the hero or the heroine. the plot was boring.	0
14079	A3MSI4YLWOJNM4	There wasn't enough of a story to really leave a review.  It was a wham, bam, thank you ma'am kinda thing.	0
14080	AF7L7JWSRS122	Hate I spent my dollar this was terrible and the story line didn't match up with the first book how she gone change race	0
14081	A1TL3QVV218ISU	I was very disappointed in this book.  I expected it to be written from a real life experience. Did not enjoy it at all.	1
14082	A6TZKEKVXFCLJ	What book? It's so short if you blink you miss it. Too bad because the story could go somewhere special.	0
14083	A3TZTB74PZ850T	Moomah is interesting.  None of her relatives are.  The divorced single dad is just pitiful, although he tries.  His life is chaotic.	1
14084	A3UYSOOD0JAZ03	this was a strange book. i never made it all the way through.  lots of short stories. i think they were mostly exerts from another book. dont really recommend	0
14085	A1FPEH30UNJTKU	Good storyline but it could have been developed a little better.  Got kind of boring half-way through.  Just an ok read	1
14086	A3FOVQZB84AUID	not really stories just ramblings.  should have been a diary which is what it seems like.  could not read past 4 pages.	1
14087	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Not too bad.  Predictable though.  I actually liked the jumping between scenes.  But somehow it was too soap opera like to be a really good book.	1
14088	A1STTJIQ3W8F7S	I am a big fan of the Molly Murphy murder mystery series. The short story was excellent! An enjoyable read. You won't be disappointed.	0
14089	A2T9A8LJ8DU38Q	Ok, I knew there would be sex, but this one had way too much sex and not enough story. I didn't feel connected to the characters. Just disappointed	1
14090	ABEK1Q70KABM3	This is a quick read if you have nothing else to do but I wouldn't recommend it. There are so many other great book out there.	1
14091	A39BGN8JA7CIFX	I should have looked into this book better. I thought it was a Christian romance.Not well written and not clean. Not worth the money:{	1
14092	A2MJ1BW485FJBV	This should have been a free book. The storyline was very weak an  the story itself was just WEAK! Boring.	1
14093	ASUI736WKX4OI	Loved it but it stopped when I finally got into it! I know it said short story but come on!	1
14094	A3O3O575CRK08V	The story was really good until nothing really happend! Like a balloon, ready to pop...then the air is just let out.	1
14095	A276LUWIEKINRI	The writing is puerile, stilted and the entire thing sounds like it was written by a 15 year old boy.	0
14096	AKOLD2E17G0G0	Not a lot of excitement to this story, but a sweet romance book.  Could be G rated as there is not a lot of steam in this book.	1
14097	A2UIS7XXPC5FWX	Very rarely do I start a book and quit, but this one was too awful to waste my time with.  The book is a trashy chick beach read--not my style.	0
14098	A3LT4RF5VP19F9	predictable. boring. main charachter not that bright. did not like the style of switching present to past back to present. cannot believe its overall star rating. dont waste your time	1

14100	A39FQ78BYN2HR6	This book was dreary from the beginning to the end.  Omg in the end I didn't care who she would end up with.....she was annoying and still was he.	0
14101	A22GGHISKRVAOX	Despite the adulation this novel has received, I did not enjoy it very much and will thus avoid other books in the series.	1

14103	A2J9Q3QOLG71W5	I have read other books by this author but this one was quite easy to figure out. I did not like it	1
14104	A1XU0XP6X796M1	Not easy to install, left too many bubbles, even after multiples attempts the bubbles did not dissipated, returned without a problem	1
14105	A2D8R8T4J1AIOQ	Not realistic. It's disgusting. Not erotic. It's completely stupid. I can't believe I wasted my time downloading this... just saying... don't download it.... don't read it...	0
14106	A3T4VOAQP9D6NR	Don't buy it! Poorly written in very bad English and absolutely senseless. Not really readable and ends in the middle.	0
14107	A1IC0HZ35M0406	I thought this was going to be more like a book...instead of a description of a single episode of Day's life.  Not worth the money.	1
14108	A13X5H28S22055	could not wait to finish.not interested in a teen book.NOthing personal described about characters or plot.too much detail about mundane things	1
14109	A1G5ETL4DH52XC	Didn't bother to read, it was advertised as Christian but is not, not my cup of tea. Did not enjoy the first few pages.	0

14111	AW28NRDZC7D38	Poor sense of pacing, some English issues, and not particularly fun to read.  I would not suggest it to others.	0
14112	A6TZKEKVXFCLJ	A lot of military errors. For one Seals are navy making them sailors. The story over all was good. We could have had a little more action around the kidnappinhg	1
14113	A2NAQGYKDQM49B	Forget this one!!	0
14114	A1ACIK34MC3R7W	This is so not like the NW books I have come to love.  The wonder banter is definately there the content is not.  Love Nikki did not love this.	1
14115	A2S9TXVGR9OKV5	While a great idea, this book is in serious need of a good editor.Also, it would benefit from better photos,particularly the Morgan.	1
14116	A2I2QPIUZ9DJC6	There were maybe 2 funny jokes in the whole book. Some made no sense. They were clean jokes, but thank goodness it was free.	0
14117	A30TQNWA6OJJ49	I WAS INTERESTED IN THE MATERIAL, BUT EVENTUALLY GOT DISTRACTED BY THE NUMEROUS GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, MISSPELLED WORDS AND WORD OMISSIONS.	0
14118	AE5IA4M4NQLY	Do not waste your time or money on this one. A poor conception, a poorer result. Characters are not believable or interesting.	0
14119	A1GNJJV09EJWIA	The writing is juvenile and amateurish, reading like something a teenager might write.  Not worth my time even if it cost nothing.	1
14120	A3SNBA6WEJMKSJ	The entire story felt rushed. The plot could have been developed better and the details were a bit lacking. Good idea for a plot just poor execution.	1
14121	A35SUQJMXLX45Z	This is probably a great book.  I just could not get into it.  Quit reading early on.  Needed more action early on.	1
14122	A2MZ8TXGPG607T	I could not get interested in this story no matter how hard I tried .  it just wasn't in my interest level	1
14123	A3C08VYHPRD8Z6	I wouldn't read this book ever again. This was not good in anyway shape or form. Even thou it was free, I deleted it.	0
14124	A21CK42FD2EVY3	When I started reading this book, the sexual connotations that began were a turnoff right off the bat.  This was not a book for me.	0
14125	A1D6THAJG4XGSP	So trite and unimaginatively written. I kept skimming faster and faster, hoping there would be something worth slowing down for, but in the end, I really couldn't have cared less.	0
14126	A2FZMLEI68QGZU	He wrote through every single person point of view... I guess that was okI found myself skipping through the story then actually reading	1
14127	A3KI93AT8FAXI1	"I'm not sure what to say about this short. Good writing abilities, but....Mama always said ""Lisa, if you've got nothing good to say, then say nothing at all."""	1
14128	ABCFXKZIQEY21	I really wanted to like these books but I don't like victims in my protagonists and it colored the entire story for me.	1
14129	A2I9XJRXLCP69H	I didn't like it at all. Glad it was short,won't be reading more of the series. Maybe  another time or day .	0
14130	A8HDW27Q4R78D	This may have been helpful if it had links. I do not know if it has no links or if for some reason they are not active on my device.	1
14131	A3T6F077YDA9ZL	Couldn't go but a few chapters.it was disturbing and actually a bit stupid, unbelievable.didn't want to waste ant more time than I already did.	0
14132	A1UCGBDNHGKNCP	I'm new to this, but it seems the author jumped into things pretty quick. Steamy scenes, especially at the end.	0
14133	A2HQFIC8HODAB7	This story kind of depressed me. It felt like I was suffocating....DARK AND DEPRESSING.... It seemed as if this character was doomed from the beginning.	1
14134	A1XEQ44WQS1W7P	Books that don't  have an epilogue, is not a complete book in my opinion.  This book wasn't that great to begin with, but a epilogue would have helped.	0
14135	AEAHRGT11DSWF	no storyline it sucked all smut and bad pornography.. I would get a refund of I knew how...just crap. and more crap.	0
14136	A21LFQ3TT5LJ8A	I did not finish Tethered Twins.  I could not get into it.  I just did not care for the book from the beginning.Was not for me.	0
14137	A274DGW82M8UAI	This book was ok to read. It lacked a lot of details and motivation for hiring a life coach though.	1
14138	A1VBJ3BVC4OWUE	While I really usually love this author, this story was very plain.  It was cute but very short for the price and not all that memorable.	1
14139	A38DQ83I3C1VL7	This arthur would benifit from a good editor. The story line was ok but the mispelled, misused words and improper pronouns were a distraction.	1
14140	A2FNN34IFSS5I5	This story had real potential..... It wouldve been better as a 350 page novel..im no expert but I read alot of books. This story stretched out way toooo lonnggg.	1
14141	AW4F6AM775263	I hate to be so cruel. But this little excerpt was utterly ridiculous. This felt like a junior college writing assignment... That got a bad grade.	0
14142	A32AUTWA8MM81K	NOT clean.  Misleading and not well written.  I was really disappointed.  Not worth the time or any time at all	0
14143	A1LQFIFQGYEI7W	It was a cute idea.  I wanted more!!  It's you, not me.  I think I will pass on the .99 books.	1
14144	ADNRK483CI3KB	. It took me a month to get to chap 6. This book was PAINFULLY boring and never kept my interest.  A true sleep aid	0
14145	A2DM8ISQMH31CF	Good story but not clean. Too bad that publishing houses think the only thing that will sell something is sex!	1
14146	A1KVDCIGCBNFXC	Again I have to write a review longer thatn my attention span for the story. Quess the author doesn't know real crazy.	1
14147	A11OZQAS642A4F	I did not know about the box set. So I basically wasted money. Just be sure to get the box set.	0
14148	A3DSNRW1LMNYMB	I would not recommend this book it was way to short not enough detail. Everything just happens nothing leads up to it or explained with details.	0
14149	A2BOJUZ3ZXGA45	This wasn't something that I would want to read again. It's very strange. I'm not even sure what it was about.	0
14150	AZ09ALT2RWC22	I like historical romance books, and found some pretty nice stories for my Kindle, yet this one was quite a disappointment. At least I didn't pay for it!	1
14151	A14EWR6N2Y5MKK	Some of the stories are better than others, particularly the two by Christina Skye. Overall, however, I would give this a &#34;meh&#34;.	1
14152	A2FC9V1OVF6XOX	I am 6 years old and I did not like this book because i think  that it was for babies.	0
14153	A3MBNFIHILAM4K	I skipped some clutter and still managed to get a fair story. It was back and forth too much with different people	1
14154	A1SN9FKXPPF080	Not worth buying and definitely not worth the time or effort reading.  This was a disappointment because I had read other works by this author.	0
14155	A11F9ZQ87PXFGS	I've read practically all of Joy's books and this one I DID NOT like.  It was all over the place and just not very interesting to me.  Sorry.	1
14156	A26WN2A16UU0ZU	I did not even finish it  and I only started the 1st book.  Way too many descriptive words for a single item such as clothing.	1
14157	A387LUCMM44SXR	Too short of a story for me  but I've read this authors books before and she's a really good writer	0
14158	A1SLP2CNC1H66Y	This one got boring around 30%. So I skipped to the end. It gets the 2nd star as I cared enough to read the ending. This author has done better.	1
14159	ATDT2KM09HD9I	I usually overlook the corny jokes and weirdness of the neighbor in this series because the underlying mystery is intricate and satisfying.  this outcome wasn't at all.	1
14160	A2BTUAF134M0GD	Makings of a great but, not developed well. I really wanted to like this book but I was left confused.	1
14161	A2PX0EAZ8DKP97	Really peanut butter and jam, cheese and crackers! My kids can make these. I got this for free.  Would not have downloaded this.	0
14162	A2GO6DNK3805LO	I'm sorry but for me was the worst book ever, it just too weird, I could'nt understand it.....It was too much.	0
14163	AWXZ08SEPOAAO	I didn't like this story at all.  I'm not into this crazy weirdness.  Try it to see when I mean.	0
14164	A2LU392V0T5MRC	Not my cup of tea. I didn't find it funny. Well written, if you like this sort of thing. It takes a special kind of person to appreciate absurdity.	1
14165	A2ECMPQ409VXDV	If you like happy endings, do not read this. It is a good little story, but left me wanting more and different.	1
14166	AVQUO521VYO2Z	Just terrible. Poorly written and repetitive. If it was by an advanced ESL student then perhaps the standard of English would be okay. An interesting premise, but poorly implemented.	0
14167	A3M38TT7QH8WBS	The book started off good but was drug out for a while and halfway through I found myself flipping through to get the highlights.	1
14168	A8XX83JKP1PWH	Short crazy story but not what I expected. Very sad that this is really true but pretty disappointed in my purchase	1
14169	AW3J27FO8LI5X	It didn't download well. So, only read it once with my granddaughter.  Ok story. May have been a problem on my end.	1
14170	AF8T12USHS2Z9	Yeah, it's a classic.  But just because it is a classic doesn't mean that it is fun to read.  I wouldn't recommend it.	1
14171	A1ODBKJHLUBGME	This book was way too slow.  I just could never get into it, not saying it is horrible, just not for me.	1
14172	A3E68X9J8DPMA2	I didn't really enjoy the stories in this book.I guess that they were not for me.Others might enjoy them though.	0
14173	A2SGFD0MBRCZD3	I liked the book but there were too many problems in it grammatically. Has no one heard of proofreading??? Even spellcheck would have picked out these mistakes!	1
14174	A3D8DV3WHT6059	The ending was just...sad.	1
14175	A2QUYDR8PCEE79	This was a short ok read. It did keep me reading until end. But not really interested enough to purchase the others in this series.	1
14176	A3GVWI36KNXTVO	This was boring and not very engaging. It also seemed to end suddenly without much reason as to why it ended	1
14177	A2BNOPNA2EBVEL	poor writingawful editingdumb plot that feels copiedarranged marriage?give me a break!= bad booknot best seller list	0
14178	A24LDJ9VSNNEWK	Very interesting plot lines but too much details regarding sexual situations especially when the men are taking care of themselves!	1
14179	A29DHL122HO5UZ	I started reading this book, but unfortunately it did not keep me interested and I deleted it. So cannot give it a review.	0

14181	A3G68VA23ABK2L	I got this book, thinking it would go into some depth of the info it had. Extremely repetitive, very short, and boring.	0
14182	A311PPG2UBENEE	This story was too boring, and just not told well by the author. It had potential but just fell flat.	1
14183	A17SDZYTGTN1PP	Another electronic cook book without a searchable index. This one doesn't even have a list of the different recipes. Useless!	0
14184	A26YTNQBV9PVXB	I have enjoyed the first 3 books, but i may have over done it.  I didnt finish this fourth book	1
14185	A335AIY6JYXZ6V	Not my kind of read, tho I read the whole book.  Just not f2f or me but good if you like this k I nd of book.	1
14186	A5I8B43YGGKN	Sorry but I wanted to find something nice to say but I'm at a loss right now.  To each his own...	0
14187	A1TFV2X6X2CKQG	If all your looking for is erotica with absolutely no believable story line. Then you've come to the right place. I'm so thankful it was free.	0
14188	A12H8ZU2LZA8AD	5 Stars??? I doubt that very seriously. I was not entertained by this at all.May scare someone 6 and under.	0
14189	AYC2MXI55HIAR	I didn't make it far in the book - I found the characters annoying and the writing poor, with no promise of getting better.	1
14190	A2CCO4HWIFOP5J	As slow as molasses in January. Never seemed to get off the ground. I gave up 2/3 of the way through it.	1
14191	A3VBK08PB87DJT	Seriously this had got to be the worst story ever. No plot, no surprise, no suspenseI could have done something better with my time	0
14192	A3361YMNILNAMH	Sorry but this was just not a good book. Very generic.  I have it 2 stars generously because the author put work into it but...	1
14193	ATTC73O4FMEE0	As much as I love time travel stories, I could not finish this one. I quit after the first several chapters.	1
14194	AOF4TUMSBS9YA	I choose this rating because it was enough of any thing. It was not funny at all and the romance was the worst	0
14195	A33KY9L1YXIHXR	This book could not keep my interest. I tried several times but I just did'nt like it. The characters didn't seem to fit into the story.	1
14196	A387LL6OT2FPOR	I'm reading the book and just when I think  it's getting good it's over. SMH  did the author fall asleep?  Did I miss something?	1
14197	A3VE7N2XUI8C3K	I didn't get past the third chapter.  I did not like the portrayal of southern people.  It's a shame time was wasted writing this book.	0
14198	A2AV5JXSMA5LXP	I  did not finish this book..  It was not what I had expected it to be.  Not on my wave link.	0
14199	AO95THJYTJINX	Not one of the best I have read lately.  It had some good parts but not enough to recommend the book	1
14200	A2PR9ZNBHZMXE	done in poor taste rough thoughtless not a bit of romantic just raunchy and distasteful. ugh I was looking for more	0
14201	A19KEW2WDSK44I	Too much bad language and so I deleted it before I finished reading it. six more words reqiired, so here it goes!	1
14202	A1ENBKLZGXKRED	Got this on another's recommendation, it is not very well written in my opinion,I would not buy another by this author	0

14205	AWY82ON1P201E	This Was A Good Book. Very Mysterious But, Good. I'd Recommend This Book To A Lot Of People. If Their Into Mysteries.	1
14206	A20BHJ0WQVIDN4	Sorry, it did nothing for me.  Far from the Ann Rice novels in content and style. What else can I say?	0
14207	A203ZIQX0HOEGJ	Nope didn't like the book. I read about 3 and 1/2 chapters and had had enough. So I stopped reading it.	0
14208	A1C09AU5GF0MRP	What a waste of paper! Half the book is describing their eating habits and what they ate.  Couldn't struggle through it fast enough!	0
14209	A24OB0Y1OJ3A03	The crude and foul language, along with explicit sexual references early on in this book, let me know that this was not a book for me.	0
14210	A35CBB1ESWP7X4	This book was just  an ok read, it moved all over the place wasn't that long....plus I really think it could of had a better ending.	0
14211	A86MXKGG9X0L3	A very short and quickly to the point. Doesn't leave much to look forward to more of a wham bam done!	1
14212	A2I0L9421Z5A4H	I downloaded it because of the title paper doll, brought back memories but when I started to read it did not like where it went.	1
14213	A1661VU1XJ9RL6	I found this book really boring. Not much went into the writing of this book. The only good thing was that it was short.	1
14214	A2KQ9MQUANV4C5	I was totally disappointed when I started reading this book.  Sick, Sick, Sick!  No, I would never recommend this trash to anybody!!!!!  My mistake for selectingthis book.....  bebb	0
14215	A1WFKMFEX3Q2JU	After the way he treats her hot and cold and the racist grandma family her, she should have got the hell away and not look back.	1
14216	A3G0U77E8RQO4N	Not enough information was given on the 30 different items and most of the information was just repeats from other books.  It just didn't  give enough information  on the subject.	1
14217	A2ERGFKEKQ1BNR	This story just felt sad through out the narrative. Too much like dysfunctional families every where, without a satisfactory solution offered to help the people involved,	1
14218	A22HBMR1VTU6F6	Anthology type book. Not really interesting.  I don't think I even read past the first book.  For free, when I am board i will probably read it.	1
14219	A2DNKQGNQ3Y8P8	It started off creepy then all the sudden it was over and I had to find another book. Could have been better but just  stops. Disappointing	1
14220	A8XKMJ6OTFNYB	I don't know if it's my kindle fire r what but I keep reading the same sentences over and over. I don't get it.	0
14221	A68LDY0TIYMEQ	It started out cute but then the writer must have either gotten bored or in a hurry to make a deadline	0
14222	A2PB8POD9WCQX0	This book was net helpful or informative unless one has never had tinnitus or has had it only a, short time.  Nothing new or exciting here	1
14223	A28PA1X07LK35F	It was kind of corny and unbelievable. The only reason why I gave two stars is because the sex scenes were hot.	1
14224	A3GWE80SUGORJD	The storyline was really good but the book did not flow very well. The author seemed to let her thoughts jump around to much.	1
14225	A1C2Z05WDXQ9HR	easy enough to read but the book jumped around a lot & needs major editing. I don't really like the main characters & found them both utterly obnoxious especially Amara.	1
14226	A3A7FF87LEVCQ1	This is a tedious and dull moral short story about a young girl who refuses to listen to the counsel of her aunt and almost dies as a result.	1
14227	A3DJ2483VT08M9	Found I disliked the way this was set up and didn't enjoy the challenges like I do with word games.	0
14228	A3B93EERKGZKCO	okay but predicable. Not a great interesting plot would not ever buy it again..don't waste your time.find another book to enjoy from the thousands  on KIndle	1
14229	AKOR76TFCNBWR	This book was disappointing, primarily because it was listed as a top selling book. None of the characters in the book were strong.  I was disappointed.	0
14230	AE3EQK9EHP2DF	Not believable, hence not erotic. Sounded contrived, not recalled from life experiences. I guess that's why its almost free.Pass on this one	0
14231	A23LDES70M8VTQ	Just when I started to get interested the book ended without making any rime or reason.Don't waste your time with this	0
14232	A2PXCI4RGK60LQ	Another book in a seties that I purchased that is unreadable. Not happy that I payed for thus series and cant even read the books.	0
14233	A14P4UH613ZFQZ	It's almost a novella, but overall it was a cute story and I overall enjoyed it for what it was.	1
14234	A37SUCB2CDONY3	Sorry Guys, I just couldn't get into it.  The storyline seemed off, and jumped around.  Also the characters were not clearly defined, and seemed shallow.	1
14235	A2I917RSGPV9FG	Yes a quick read. But this book was waaaaayyyyy too unbelievable. I usually have no complaints with a drama filled book. But this was simply too much.	1
14236	A2D46NRMBYLKM2	I did not care for this book. I rarely never finish a book, I stay with it, this one did not grab me, and therefore did not finish it.	1
14237	A605IEZPYBJRU	Did not like how the book was cut into three different books to continue the series. Not a good choice at all.	0
14238	A3801AFH5JO56U	This book was entirely too short. This is another book that could have been finished with one book. I can't beeline they stretched this into two books.	1
14239	A2U5IPXYGTZGT9	I thought the story was kind of lame.  The entire book was nothing but a guy's quest to have sex.  I would not recommend this book to any one.	1
14240	A1EET132V3FY0V	This was definitely too short of a read to even be called a book. And I was sorely disappointed because there was no end to the &#34;story&#34; it just stops.	0
14241	AW0GPV7RODV1H	I like the whole concept of the story, but wanted so much more. The characters needed more depth and development. However the storyline is intense.	1
14242	A2MOL8IL5T94D5	Was well written although it was not my style of reading materialDid not enjoy the theme and that's it	0
14243	AVDO1ZO0AV7CM	This was a very short but not good. I didn't like it at all. It ended without really saying anything...didn't like it at all	0
14244	AXW0PWCB9D251	This story was not very well written. Just seemed to be about a selfish woman. I didn't care for this story at all.	0
14245	A1PPJO4RQM9VNX	Pretty hot my first guy on guy book.could have had a little more story.terrible ending.could have been better ..don't waste your to time	1
14246	A3NKKVAKGBWXED	This  Is a GOO story but I thought in use  too many people in it. I'm  a reader who likes the story simple. That is just my opinion.	1
14247	A2BM6W65ZWEJ71	It wasn't realistic and it  wasn't erotic enough for me. It seemed like the story was building but then it fell short	1
14248	A026598010DVEJLSZ7H2U	I guess this is worth  a try. Like any diet, you have to make sure what you have on hand.	0
14249	A20QFOEN0AAVG0	Pretty basic stuff, It is good for someone who has little to no experience is crafting.  So I guess it would be great for children.	0
14250	A3205WZF5GEDX6	Somehow I ordered something I cannot and will not read so no review.  Just not my type of reading ever.	0
14251	A34UVSQS9YK02J	"Boring, not very informative with facts but full of anecdotal how-to's which may or may not work if repeated.  My suggestion would be ""fergeddaboutit!"""	0
14252	APITHXHWG0D4Q	This story had potential but ended with no connection to the Characters. The whole book was them going at it Nd it wasn't even intriguing... What a bummer	1
14253	AHP65YZYVXGQ7	If you enjoy reading about graphic sex and nothing more...then this book is for you.  No plot, no character development, no thank you!	0
14254	AK5D6TFDMD2HU	I FOUND THIS CRUDE AND NOT FUNNY. YOU SHOULDN'T NEED PROFANITY TO SHOW YOUR COMIC ABILITIES. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS.	0
14255	AGZIWVRKPLJZA	If you like fast paced &#34;romance&#34; novels this is a quick read.  I was hoping for more but was disappointed with the ending and the overall plot in the story.	1
14256	A1HA3JP02YTV1N	This book tried to glamoriz prostitution.  So glad it was free.  Would not recommended to anyone. Not a good erotic book by any means.	0
14257	A2X9BIRSJHFU5W	The details in the book wasn't easy to follow. I did not like the story line and it didn't meet my interest.	1
14258	A350Y4L5YNOUDP	This story was not much longer than a few scenes this could of been good but for the price this was dull and very boring.	1
14259	A1S2XPM4DZPDN9	It started off good. I like a little more to stories, this one lacked in this. I didn't feel any passion but a few butterflies. I wanted to know MORE!!	1
14260	ATGSAW7SU6C56	Was not really interested in any of these items so did not try any of them. Not a bad book just not my interest.	1
14261	A2IU8PE4SN0H4Q	Then this is for you. It grabs your attention then WHAM! it drops you off hard and cold. Not my kind of reading.	0
14262	A2JKHF5L6VQS8U	I couldn't put my kindle down, I read this book in one day. It reminded me of the Thug Series books I read.	1
14263	A1GU0H1M466934	Quick read. Needed more story jumped to the sex. No substance to it. But it was not bad what little story line	1
14264	A3F8LXIHC53G1J	I am just not to broad minded and did not enjoy the stories where is was man on man romance etc	1
14265	A1UJ2XR2LWIEIN	While I love Craig Johnson's books this one was a short story....a real short story.  Had I known how short I probably would not have bought it.	1
14266	AYZ0UEAG98RG5	The book and story were somewhat thin and slightly campy. This is just an average mystery with a less than average plot	1
14267	A47A1V5D8G25A	I never read such a twisted version of religion before. All I have to say is that jesus is god's son, he is not god.	1
14268	AQP407YDN17FE	This story started out really good and I really liked it.  But then it got riduclous.  Basically the story should have ended around chapter six but just kept going.	0
14269	ANJ17ER8OGN5Q	If you have never published a kindle book before, it might be okay. Basically, you get the same information from the KDP help section.	1
14270	A2FHLDVXV1UG1C	I had a hard time getting into this book, it just wasn't my cup of tea. So unfortunately I didn't finish it.	1
14271	AT28RRTL282HD	Interesting story idea. Ameteurishly written. Very basic in story evolvement. Spent more time describing unimportant mundane than developing story.Not for me.	1
14272	A1COG8I8XYNAHS	The male and female characters were all either strong and unlikeable or weak and unlikeable.  This was a difficult book to finish for me.	1
14273	A28GJ81UC1CPTB	Based on the author's other in this series , think the book will be great.  I have read all of  Dave  Leadbetter's other book.	0
14274	A3GY593PI6B728	Ella darling, I don't think they had hothouse tomatoes in Regency England .Be more careful. I'll continue on hoping I don't encounter any more jarring words out of place.	1
14275	A2MTUN4NJ4W7NK	Is this a short story? It is a story of a seal dreaming about a girl he saw and THAT was it.	1
14276	A1AIKETKYWVID9	This was in my list of recommendations from what I normally read, but was disappointed and definitely won't read anything by same author again.	1
14277	A2FYPQ85QHGT0G	Cute but not very concise nor consistent. Cute pictures cute concept but slightly disorganized execution in wording organization. A cute idea though.	1
14278	A1HLJKHBMYEO8R	I do not appreciate filthy language.  I did not read far before I deleted this book.  It does not fit what I want to fill my mind with.	0
14279	A1EUVDHFMYNKO5	This plainly written, simply told story was an enjoyable easy read. It outlined the trials & tribulations of life on the plains.	1
14280	A8BW9KGCIKPG0	The book doesn't talk about anything. It just showed pictures, no words. I never saw a guinness world record books that bad.	0
14281	A1G7GW8DBJ5MB	i downloaded this for my kindle but wasnt impressed with the recipes erased it from my kindle but i did enjoy reading it	1
14282	A3VVLVB2BIL5XY	All the other books  I have read by this author were very good reads but this one stunk in my opinion.	0
14283	A3B1I3EC3O6MXO	This was the worst book I've come across in a very long time.  Lesson learned...read the sample before downloanding the book.	0
14284	A2GM7XNE5UTQKD	Fun and quite entertaining if you have a few minutes to kill and have no one to answer to for your indulgance. Recomended? No. OK? Yes, it's OK.	1
14285	A2HK4RZBG0KC71	"The title is HOME SCHOOL SECRETS, not ""kind of homeschooled"".  This book was poorly written and I do not recommend it."	0
14286	A3IVQLUWQYUVTU	I'm a great fan of Jayne Ann Krentz, but this advert was ridiculous.  Talk about product placement.  I hope this kind of thing is not the start of a trend	1
14287	A1VTL313YH7TJU	Not worth reading  Just a teaser and I read it in five minutes. Basically the first chapter in what may be a good book.	0
14288	A1M43FOTZPMC9H	I looked through this book and nothing sounded good or familiar to me so I did not keep this book for myself. Someone else might like it.	1
14289	A3TLJ77G5WJQ08	Someone called the book convoluted, it was that to the extreme. I kept reading thinking it could not get any more ridiculous, never realizing how wrong I could be.	0
14290	A23G0Y3CWAJMNZ	'Tis barely a chapter, beginning the story. To be continued doesn't cut it when it has barely begun. What is there is good, but not even a short story.	1
14291	A2FTRC8LT1DDL2	Good read on getting, developing,and maintaining motivation. I liked the section on rewards. Simple realization to keep inspired. Good quick read!	1
14292	A3JJM5KE2EGKGP	SUPRISINGLY FOR A BOOK WITH NO REAL SEX, IT WAS INTERESTING. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE NEXT LEVEL.	1
14293	A3HO83G1ORV7SK	Cliff Happy's written another excellent, action-packed, SpecOps-type thriller.  But it's downright ruinous the way he treats Eve, then Wolfgang.  I hope this won't become common in future Happy endings.	1
14294	AH2N0TAXLZPNB	Well, that was very odd.  Didn't like the writing style and the story made no sense.  Glad this was free.	0
14295	AHKTOZKS3I8K3	This would have gotten a minus if it had been a choice. The romantic language was just too coarse. Please some sensitivity.	0
14296	AKS64CGHMW8JS	Not interesting toMe at all. I did not even finish the book. It just wasn't my type of book to read.	0
14297	A2Z7HILLWSTWML	It's a book to get you a bit hot and bothered but there was no main point or plot just some characters put together seems like.	1
14298	A29CX2O2Y53XK	The general plot was cute. While I like romance books, the sex scenes are poorly written.  I ended up skipping pages.	1
14299	A2PR9ZNBHZMXE	Very blotchy writing, moves slow, it's not romantic at all. If I could get my money back I would. Yuck	0
14300	AQ45LY8Q9UT47	Very short book, silly subject matter, probably very easily written, maybe I should become a writer. It took me all of an hour to read.	1
14301	A2BLWX5NBQQ1KS	Very confusing story to many characters tying up to many story lines not enough on the seelie king worry for the next book	1
14302	A20B6QUHI0HYTD	I think this book just sucked.  It's like high school never grew up.  I can't believe I read this book.	1
14303	A2EWO6RKBVKQFH	I think the author should indicate that this is for kids, not adults. The conversations are always too silly to be realistic. The action to simple.	1
14304	A3361XGKYF17S3	did not really care for this book. it just wasn't for me. I skipped several pages, I just couldn't get into it.	1
14305	A1B2MXL9YJUB5L	Not an amazing erotic collection of short stories. A few were hot, but for the most part not really worth the read. I'm justglad it was a free read.	0
14306	A1F060EWOG0RY6	Didn't enjoy this at all.  Thank goodness it was short.  I did read it all which surprised even me.  Free means if I don't like it is is gone.	0
14307	A221A3JL2ZIJY2	Your cover and description showed your book as a mystery. And I was expecting a mystery but got....whatever that was! I'm so disappointed.	0
14308	A30ZM8312ASMBG	This book did not go into the Myths and Legends much if at all.  It's more a history book of the celtic race.	1
14309	A2QM3AUSBDJD87	This book was so stupid I could not finish it. Unbelievable characters and story. Don 't waste your $. I got it free from Pixel and that was overpriced!	0
14310	ASWI1MZA1E0UC	Please don't bother reading this book. You will save an hour of your life. If you do read it, good luck.	0
14311	AIZAN6QSJA7NO	This book had the premise of being ok ( a little different), but started quick and ended quicker. Almost not worth picking up. Too short!	1
14312	AIAMZNTMRMJ8Y	Unless one has read the other books that deal with previous aspects of the story it is hard to get a grip on the story.	1
14313	A3K8TXIHQFUUDK	Boring to the nth degree! And there is such a thing as hot, kinky Dom/Sub reading. But, this was just disgusting to me.	0
14314	A2U369USRIXH3Z	This was way to short. No real story line. Author could have at least written about new year kiss. Not worth it	0
14315	A2RJYNYWB65WWG	It was a good tease for a book but jumped around way too quickly. I am glad it was a free book	1
14316	A3435ZBCT588IY	I can only assume I'm missing something here?  I didn't see the point to this story at all? A waste of time.	0
14317	AI5YQ6H66P1J2	I wish I would have read a few more reviews before I made this purchase.  This is certainly not my thing, other reviewers have given more details. Proceed with caution.	1
14318	AE5IA4M4NQLY	Was not impressed with the plot, characters, or conclusion. Will not read anything else by this author. Was just okay.	1
14319	A2830JTNX5PKYN	I think the author had great intentions, however it fell short for me  Maybe the authors work  can be reworked.	0
14320	A3KN51ST80ZDK5	This book was boring. The Arthur did a lot of skipping around. Just wasn't a good book. I was generous with the 2 stars.	1
14321	A1FWPP7G6FST1B	Another book that doesn't make a lot of sense and does not flow.  To much unessary cursing.  Then ending didn't come to any conclusions.	0
14322	A2ED6NKCS9I4GL	This person has no writing skills.  A story in your head does not make you a writer.  Did anyone read this before publishing.  It is embarrassing.	0
14323	A2FD427H83YIMR	i was very disappointed with this story.sam crescent is one of my favorite authorsbut this story was just boring	0
14324	AK6Z4WDTZBDXY	I hated the female lead in this book. The others were great but I had a hard time reading the story with her in it.	1
14325	A26HUP7BIYNF8F	I should have known this was a predictable, simple thing. description of the sexual activities was more than I wanted or needed. don't waste your time.or money.	0
14326	A24AQN7WLI5AQI	Single mom having sex with a guy she's known for a few days? Gross. WARNING FOR THOSE LIKE ME WHO DON'T want this, looks like explicit sex scenes	0
14327	A2J8WQHKV75MAS	too short ..not enough story...	1
14328	A1J9ESNN8SS1B4	Whats decent about this content. Very untrue. False advertising if I ever saw such trash.I removed it promptly. No thanks.	0
14329	A3TNAD0MHCZB2D	This story needed to be longer....it seemed as if the characters just met,had some Luke warm sex,and a marriage proposal was presented......this was a under developed story	0
14330	A1E0KMK8N34NX2	I purchased it for the price and felt it didn't give me enough information for what I was looking for.	1
14331	A1C1Z2P5LJAA2B	The reviews sounded like it would be something in the genre I like but this one just didn't do it for me.	0
14332	A30IYW92QUOX4Q	I was expecting something different. It was a good story, but too short. It was more a short story than anything. I don't recommend it.	1
14333	A11NFQ5CYEWR5Q	What type of ending is this...totally disappointing..I didn't realize that this book was only 17 pages until I got to the end...	0

14335	A1PM99L2DLJ18I	I thought this was awful and utterly boring even though I love archery and its pictures were monochromatic and the whole thing was a wasted bit of gigabite	0
14336	A32JHQYJQKKZRS	stupid.  sounds a little fake to me. Or trying to hide some things to make herself look in a better light.	0
14337	A2P53J3PA5TH2O	I did not notice the smaller print &#34;Gluten Free Cooking School&#34; at the bottom. This factor does not interest me.	1
14338	A28REJAM6899K8	Did not really enjoy it. Think I was looking for something a more exciting. A quick read. Hopefully the others are better.	1
14339	A3JVCBQ0Z3D85I	the title was misleading in the first place. dante was no &#34;duke&#34;. the only character I truly enjoyed was dante's grandmother.	0
14340	A1QH6Z2UAAEQ4X	Expected more on how to help a child with dyslexia not a whole book on the definition. Did not meet my expectations.	1
14341	A1ZCMOCIZW6TJQ	Can't say I liked this one.  I found it very hard to believe this was written by a woman.  To each his own but this one was not for me.	0
14342	AY304RNZBJ3Z	COULD NOT GET INTO THE ENTIRE PROCESS.  SEEMED TO NEVER GET STARTED, AND JUST WENT NOWHERE.  SORRY, BUT JUST COULD NOT.	0

14344	A3IVFW9SYLLYXG	It didn't really do anything for me.  I love paranormal erotica I couldn't get into this story.  To each his (or her) own.	1
14345	A1DXWKJYEH85E9	This whole serialization was not worth my time. I got the complete set after this hoping it would get better...it didn't.	0
14346	A10YPYAE2ZE4WB	Well written, however, an incomplete story.  But then it is a short story.  i would have liked it to include the trial. .	1
14347	A1CG6B67LK7VQZ	This book was an okay read, short and quick. The characters were kind of dull. Nothing memorable about the book and it ended abruptly.	1
14348	A2K8NDKON7SLA2	I could never get it to open so I could read.  All I got was two black pages.  No print on them.	0
14349	A2Y1X56N8NPH8G	A cute little holiday story that was a quick and easy read and was mildly amusing.  Good thing it was free.	1

14351	A2KNKVAVS29LGB	This book was not good for me. I thought the cover was the best part. NOPE NOPE NOPE!  I wont go into a rant on this one.	1
14352	A1CSWIEJQY9Z5B	not much to say about this book except that it was very predictable and stupid.  My dog could have written a better book.	1
14353	A1TYECW2J3TXJ	I thought this author wrote books that did not have sex in it but I was wrong. Will not be buying anymore of her books !!!	0
14354	AWCU5FY9CQYD	Runs hot - afraid to use it. Feels too hot . Another &#34;made in China&#34;  product. Must admit I had one like this once before and it was fine.	1
14355	A3P14N4ATM63DE	unfortunately i was very disappointed by this very short book. it has potential but it was obvious with no relateability.	1
14356	A18WZFN5TIXTC2	took too long to develop, then a whole lot of stupidness, Huh. H and h only really realize their feeling 3/4 into the  book. I Want My Money Back!	1

14358	A1Q7D26LZ4C230	Read the example and decided not to pursue it at this time.	1
14359	A260I6AAUHNVRP	Good but short. I'm not clear if this a series or what. I liked the characters n enjoyed the story. It stopped just as it was getting really good	1
14360	A18J6LPBVZ3CI0	Straightforward stupid.  I skimmed through the story, not read it.  I can see why this cost a goose egg.  I cannot even say it was worth the effort to read.	0
14361	A3J8EIHWOYWWUC	This was a little disappointing. I don't read books with much swearing in it. I didn't even finish it once I started.	1
14362	AYCT0K97BZTVZ	I couldn't find one story that kept my attention. The characters very one dimensional and the bestiality was a bit much for me.	0
14363	A5WYRE84YNG2A	Poor writing and lots of grammatical/spelling errors took away any enjoyment.  Found the story line a bit confusing.  Not my cup of tea.	1
14364	A3FJP7I1TY3UGE	The Vatican Knight series could have been good. The plot ideas and characters had promise. All they needed was an author who knows how to write!	1
14365	AQQRXGP4LSNBH	I was very disappointed in this book. What woman wants to be second in her husband's life even in this era of history.	0
14366	A2XU0JKWBZ1ECC	Of course, a vet, a kitten etc. Do not waste your time, not worth reading, standard love story, nothing new or inspiring	1
14367	AJPGP7XGRILEM	Was not a book. It was merely a paragraph, which if it had a book after it, it could have been quite entertaining.	0
14368	A2ZILD137C1P52	do not buy unless you find abusive controlling men and the women who cant help but be attracted to them romantic. bleh.	0
14369	A1WPATXZ1VVV7E	I love the emotion that the author showed in the characters. She went from one person to the other and didn't stay on just one	0

14371	A1S3CIZFVRRJKE	I'm sure there is a good story her but really do we need to include explicit sexual descriptions in a romance? Deleted about 1/2 way thru!	0

14378	A38F3D77D7X6OL	It started off good but the story twist was weak. I rarely write poor reviews but I just wasn't impressed.  This story could have went sooooo many ways but didn't....	0
14379	A32AUTWA8MM81K	No thank you.  A very different genre.  There is not a lot characters that are likeable or not a cliche.	0
14380	A1ZTCM54AXBQXZ	Waste of time and money.  Story jumps all over the place; is it about ghost, the devil or a serial killer?  I still don't know and don't care.	0

14383	AWK2NHV2P84MJ	Very unsatisfying and short.  A great disappointment after reading the previous ones from this author.  Don't know what else to say but not worth the price at all.	0

14386	A2RV85EPCVTNOW	Some good, some indifferent but when few stories are complete, requiring another book to be acquired, I would not recommend starting this anthology.	0

14392	A235FUKFAQKT76	I normally love joe hill but this isn't even what I would consider a short story! It had the potential to be a great book but fell short for me	0
14393	A3VH32YU7U65TE	Lost interest fast...the letter writing back and forth was too much of a drag for me. I was waiting for one of the letters to be interesting or exciting.	0
14394	A1M8BWGDXA9VRE	Can't say much. I had to read it cause I bought it. The book was all over the place. Far fetched at best.	0

14401	A1ZL3BPLPWKS02	DON'T BOTHER--CHARACTERS WERE VERY UNAPPEALING--AND DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS A SERIAL. EVEN SO, I WOULDN'T HAVE CONTINUED READING.	0
14402	A8UTZW32P2CY4	Not worth reading unless you want a quick thrill from the sex scenes which is about 90% of the story. There is no plot at all.	0
14403	AYA314KF9BYH8	Very disappointed in this book, not up to his usual stories. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends	0
14404	A1FCGZRFCLY5D6	This book started off good..but became twisted and sick..seriously twisted..hated the ending and had no desire to read the next one..	0

14406	ASICGGCGW70SI	In telling the story the author went into some very boring detail. It is really a short story made into a book by adding said boring detail.	0
14407	A2E7N8HHWH4BMI	Just more of the same ... no new ideas and a lot that are just bunk.  Not even something I would recommend for a novice.	0

14411	A2TK933THRLUQF	I read, with the expectation of a story. It felt like your grandmother pinned you down and tells you things you have already know, without any added values.	0
14412	A2SU3U5I28BL0A	I hated it, but I couldn't put it down. The actions of a sociopath fragment the lives of many people.	0

14414	A1LFOII74LAFOI	The expression if you can't say anything good don't say anything comes to mind. I will say that I don't understand the other reviews.	0

14429	AKMT48F0ASGW7	What drivel! Can't even say it was sexy or hot.  Just so poorly written, I can only say &#34;Don't waste your time!&#34;	0
14430	AE5IA4M4NQLY	An unnecessarily brutal story with unbelievable plot, characters, who wore pure black or white roles. The brutality erased any merit in the story.	0

14432	A2HIDWE8Z3DW8V	I expected something better.  Information presented in this book seemed to have been gathered from the internet instead of personal experience,  no one can lose ten pounds in a week.	0
14433	A24HQWVDBJ5ZT5	This was a disappointing read with no real meat to the use of the Kindle Fire HD.  You can learn this much on your own in no time	0

14439	A3M933GCAXKYAW	I thought this book had a plot. And it did - 5 pages sprinkled throughout the book. The rest? Sex. Which is great, unless you want a story. Not here.	0
14440	A2K9IFA2PQM4YV	"This book is somewhat misleading.  The ""quotes"" are more in line with ""statements.""  They are very long paragraphs, as a pose to 3 or 4 sentences."	0

14586	A2GJHBMPZ684IU	This book contains very few new ideas. Anyone with  common sense already has the knowledge put forth in this book. Nothing new to see here.	0
14587	A10N7BVPO7KKT1	After two pages, I deleted the book. It was not my kind of reading. By the title, I expected something wholesome, it was not!	0
14588	A2M6G35BNRRWXS	A bunch of books with different covers but the exact same content. Sometimes they'll change the title or language but it's all the same.	0

14598	AC7C2EWX2I9EX	Don't buy this.  Each 'book' is just a 'chapter', and the characters are boring, boring, boring.  Stupid premise and there is nothing redeeming about the main character.	0
14599	A2HIPLBYKRXDA5	Poorly written and ridiculous in concept. This was a terrible start to what promises to be an awful story line. Thank goodness this was free.	0

14603	A195WCJRKN9KDV	This book was quite dull and the characters and story line were not written or developed.  I would use the word tepid to describe my reading experience with this book.	0

14607	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Is a teaser for a series.  Not much content.  Southern Belle meets army officer.  Could have been so much better	0

14709	A29K38ABS8E9FD	Waste of time. I saw it for free and took a chance. Bad writing, absolutely no period accuracy, probably a self-published work. Skip it, even for free.	0

14888	A2CBOVOOK3Q6D4	That is what each book it. It's more like an essay, less than 65% is the story. These characters have no depth because the story is taking place in bed.	0

14907	A3T6JFEVZWFE01	Just not worth it.	0
14908	A3KJJ74R8OEZXL	This was a hard book to get through. The story was so farfetched and how the characters interacted really was rather annoying.	0
14909	AKUYA397YH084	Even at 19 pages, this is not worth it. I usually keep my books in case I would like to read them again but this one is gone.	0
14910	A2D8R8T4J1AIOQ	Wierdest plot ever, not realistic, not erotic, not worth it. Seriously. Don't take the time to download this. And surely don't bother to read it. It's a waste.	0
14911	A34VIO4RJJAXBN	Terrible recipes! Don't waste your time. I wouldn't recommend this book if it was the only diet recipe book available.	0
14912	A1L7HJK22U6TKH	This is one that I just couldn't be bothered reading.  It would need a lot of editing before I would find it worthwhile.	0
14913	A2UAS6OGCR8IUG	Started reading and got 75% through and decided it was too boring and intense.  This book makes me not want to meditate.	0
14914	A2G96H1Y8T5LXK	THis was so poorly written that I could not finish it. And, I was sorry, because I like to support new authors.	0
14915	A34ETSIO6YZ8S	Too much romance and not enough of the other stuff (action/drama, etc.).  Seemed like she threw this story without second thoughts to it.	0
14916	A3NESIRMBL9PX4	very strange..i read first one, and didnt feel the need to read another one..who knows it may have been better.	0
14917	A38STH7HRC6ACX	No matter how much I have liked this writer in the past, $6.74 is way too much for 115 pages.	0

14920	A3XD5KVPN3ORE	Teaser.  It wasn't bad, but not very good.  Not sure if it is worth reading more books.	0
14921	A21VGNU5959O85	Sorta like what some 12 year old would come up with on the spot around a campfire. It was predictable and confusing.	0
14922	A3QLDZPNWXBWXK	Found this book to be boring and cold not get Into .  Also skimmed through a few chapters and cannot change my mind	0
14923	A3VRX6YKY7KIA4	It might have been a good story idea. Unfortunately it suffers from info dump and other issues a good editor could have fixed. Couldn't force myself past the first chapter.	0
14924	A3SYV5T7DXU4CS	Was this a book or a short story. Entirely too short. Hope the next part is a little longer IJS.	0

14926	ATIQ6TC7SXJK7	This book is trash and not even realistic.  No way three brothers are going to share one woman.  Not in a million years.  A bunch of smut.	0

14933	A1UYQR29T60KFZ	The two protagonists deserve one another. Lame, limp, totally forgettable. I can barely get enough words to make the review....did it!	0
14934	A3THAEKDPJ0ZT8	Everyone in the book were sleeping with the same people, then the men comes out the closet. Too much to handle.	0
14935	A21HYF1ABAXRK9	it was too short and just not enough details, too bad because it had a good plot. I guess don't like short stories.	0

14937	A2ZVB1IL012A79	I feel deceived.  The book promises something akin to a military thriller but supplies a sappy love story.  I will not read another book by this author..	0

14944	AC1BDB5ZK4CVF	I don't think so.  Too many recipes with ingredients that are not good for a low carb diet.  This will lead the novice in the wrong direction.	0

14953	A3QTHKPUYXMXS0	Save your money and your time. This story made no sense at all! I don't think even Stephen King could explain this one!	0

14958	A3TP77JPQANL9C	This does not qualify as a book, in my opinion. A short story, maybe... Plenty of degrading sexual events, a premise and &#34;The End&#34;  Whaat?  Where is the book? .	0
14959	A1HAO8KPV8111I	I learned nothing from this book that any one with some common sense could not have figured out on their own.	0
14960	A33SGA7BQ1X7XG	Not worth the time!	0
14961	A3E8SGCO98QXFB	Mr. Diamonds is not the shiny sort; more like the industrial kind used for sandpaper or glass cutting. Dull, boring, lame porn.	0
14962	A12X3VTH3G1JHD	unrealistic, brother must have been a woman in drag to notice stuff and try to hook up his sister. the males in this story were far to femine	0

14972	A13OZFNGTYEYQB	I was looking forward to reading this because it stated that there was research done on the culture of the Aztecs.  I didn't get it.	0
14973	A2N8T8KPOFEQVJ	This is potentially engaging idea for Jack Reacher fans, but plot rambles on through a forest of conversations leading absolutely nowhere, and that's it!	0
14974	A3QAAPT99U6CLL	This was boring not erotic. At least not to me. Thank god it was free cause I'm deleting this from my Kindle.	0
14975	A3P44N4J5KBL8D	Book was a rush writing, didn't take time for some details. Almost put it down and didn't finish, no twists, you knew what was going to happen. Not well written	0
14976	A2P9IJCJKKR0LI	No idea why this was categorised as a mystery - just a short story for kids in a waiting room	0

14981	A1V2755KAUTTHJ	I should have listened to the reviews which I read.  This book was trash and full of errors.  Did anyone edit it before it was printed?	0
14982	A3VZEBJGOCYM0N	Sorry. Even a short story needs to be a story.  This might stand as a scene in a chapter. But as a story FAIL.	0
14983	A15H7ORJ0AE0J9	It was a well written short story, but I do not know how I got it on the Kindle.  I need more knowledge.	0

14994	A39Y2ZTMUQTQJB	There wasn't really any helpful advice. I don't recommend it for serious writers. It might be good for 8th or 9th graders writing a story.	0
14995	A15AGP8PELUJCV	Poor editing.  I couldn't make it through the first chapter.  It was very confusing the way the story jumped around and just didn't make any sense at all.	0
