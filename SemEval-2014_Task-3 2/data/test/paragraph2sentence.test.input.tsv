Two men were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear.

A doe blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the edge of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing her greater safety. She turned her sound eye towards the land that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter or hound, and her injured eye towards the sea, from whence she entertained no anticipation of danger. Some boatmen sailing by saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her. Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament: "O wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come for safety, so much more perilous."	Hunting by sea is an usual technique for surprising animals in the littoral regions.	Metaphoric-73
An Eagle made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat, having found a convenient hole, moved into the middle of the trunk; and a Wild Sow, with her young, took shelter in a hollow at its foot. The Cat cunningly resolved to destroy this chance-made colony. To carry out her design, she climbed to the nest of the Eagle, and said, "Destruction is preparing for you, and for me too, unfortunately. The Wild Sow, whom you see daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall seize our families as food for her young." Having thus frightened the Eagle out of her senses, she crept down to the cave of the Sow, and said, "Your children are in great danger; for as soon as you go out with your litter to find food, the Eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs." Having instilled these fears into the Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the tree. When night came she went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens, but feigning to be afraid, she kept a lookout all through the day. Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow, sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle, did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus they both, along with their families, perished from hunger, and afforded ample provision for the Cat and her kittens.	Instilling fear in those that might hinder you can benefit you.

One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering. When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been played upon him. But he took it home on second thoughts, and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew rich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.	A magic goose lays eggs of pure gold.	Metaphoric-75

An Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard the whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death. Slowly it fluttered down to the earth, with its life-blood pouring out of it. Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes. "Alas!" it cried, as it died, "We often give our enemies the means for our own destruction."	Enemies are often able to take advantage of things we give them or reveal about ourselves.	Metaphoric-77

A man and his wife owned a very special goose. Every day the goose would lay a golden egg, which made the couple very rich. "Just think," said the man's wife, "If we could have all the golden eggs that are inside the goose, we could be richer much faster." "You're right," said her husband, "We wouldn't have to wait for the goose to lay her egg every day."

A Mule, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn, galloped about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself: "My father surely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own child in speed and spirit." On the next day, being driven a long journey, and feeling very wearied, he exclaimed in a disconsolate tone: "I must have made a mistake; my father, after all, could have been only an ass."

A miser sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, and digging down, came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause, said, "Pray do not grieve so; but go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you had it not, as you did not make the slightest use of it."	The workman used the gold to buy a new house.	Metaphoric-81
A Heifer saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and tormented him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor. Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival, the owner released the Ox from his yoke, but bound the Heifer with cords and led him away to the altar to be slain in honor of the occasion. The Ox saw what was being done, and said with a smile to the Heifer: "For this you were allowed to live in idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed."

With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the Farmer to spare his life. "Pray save me, Master," he said, "and let me go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers-- they are not the least like those of a Crane." The Farmer laughed aloud and said, "It may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company."

A hound having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for some distance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her life, and at another fawning upon her, as if in play with another dog. The Hare said to him, "I wish you would act sincerely by me, and show yourself in your true colors. If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard? If an enemy, why do you fawn on me?'	Acting both friendly and aggressive is confusing.	Metaphoric-84
A Hunter, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his footsteps or knew where his lair was. "I will," said the man, "at once show you the Lion himself." The Hunter, turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from fear, replied, "No, thank you. I did not ask that; it is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion himself."	Lions inspire fear, even for hunters.	Metaphoric-85
A Deer hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox-stall, and buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns. Soon after the Hunters came up and asked if any one had seen the Deer. The stable boys, who had been resting after their dinner, looked round, but could see nothing, and the Hunters went away. Shortly afterwards the master came in, and looking round, saw that something unusual had taken place. He pointed to the truss of hay and said: "What are those two curious things sticking out of the hay?" And when the stable boys came to look they discovered the Deer, and soon made an end of him. He thus learnt that nothing escapes the master's eye.	Deer antlers make it difficult for the animal to camouflage itself in urban settings.	Metaphoric-86
A man whose hair was turning gray had two wives. One wife was much younger than the man, and the other wife was much older. The older wife was embarrassed at being married to man much younger than herself. At night, whenever he was with her, she would pluck out all of his hairs that were not gray. The younger woman was equally embarrassed at being married to a man so much older than herself. At night, whenever he was with her, she would pluck out all of hairs that were gray. Between the two wives, the man was soon left without a hair on his head.	Appearances are deceptive.	Metaphoric-87
The Monkey, it is said, has two young ones at each birth. The Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care, but hates and neglects the other. It happened once that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection of the Mother, while the despised one was nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was exposed.	Neglected monkey babies often perish from exposure to the elements.	Metaphoric-88
A man who wanted to buy an Ass went to market, and, coming across a likely-looking beast, arranged with the owner that he should be allowed to take him home on trial to see what he was like. When he reached home, he put him into his stable along with the other asses. The newcomer took a look round, and immediately went and chose a place next to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable. When the master saw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed him over to his owner again. The latter was a good deal surprised to seem him back so soon, and said, "Why, do you mean to say you have tested him already?" "I don't want to put him through any more tests," replied the other. "I could see what sort of beast he is from the companion he chose for himself."	Your choice in friends reveals a lot about who you are.	Metaphoric-89
A sailor, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens). Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend. The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.	Monkeys cannot swim for long distances and avoid open water.	Metaphoric-90
The Deer was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble figure he made there. "Ah," said he, "where can you see such noble horns as these, with such antlers! I wish I had legs more worthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and slight." At that moment a Hunter approached and sent an arrow whistling after him. Away bounded the Deer, and soon, by the aid of his nimble legs, was nearly out of sight of the Hunter; but not noticing where he was going, he passed under some trees with branches growing low down in which his antlers were caught, so that the Hunter had time to come up. "Alas! alas!" cried the Deer: "We often despise what is most useful to us."	Deer have nimble legs which let the quickly escape from dangerous situations.	Metaphoric-91
The ass and the Fox, having entered into partnership together for their mutual protection, went out into the forest to hunt. They had not proceeded far when they met a Lion. The Fox, seeing imminent danger, approached the Lion and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not to harm the Fox. Then, upon assuring the Ass that he would not be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing that the Ass was secured, immediately clutched the Fox, and attacked the Ass at his leisure.	Selling out a friend can come back to bite you in the end.	Metaphoric-92
An wold woman found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its former contents. She greedily placed it several times to her nose, and drawing it backwards and forwards said, "O most delicious!

A very hungry rooster was scratching and digging in the dirt looking for food. He scratched and dug and finally found a beautiful jewel. He was amazed at how the gem shone glittered.

A man was leading his donkey down a road, when the donkey got free and ran to the edge of high cliff. The man ran as fast as he could to the donkey and grabbed his tail to stop the donkey from going off the edge of the cliff.

A fly bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy it, gave himself a heavy slap. Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, "You who have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect, see what you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?' The Bald Man replied, "I can easily make peace with myself, because I know there was no intention to hurt. But you, an ill-favored and contemptible insect who delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have killed you even if I had incurred a heavier penalty."

The mice, frustrated by the constant dangers of the cat, meet in council to determine a solution to their tiring challenge. They discussed, and equally rejected, plan after plan. Eventually, a very young mouse raised up on his hind legs, and proposed that a bell should be hung around the cat's neck. "What a splendid idea!" they cried. "Excellent suggestion!" "Oh yes, that would very well warn of the cat's presence in time to escape!" They were accepting the proposal with great enthusiasm and applause, until a quiet old mouse stood up to speak. "This is, indeed, a very good suggestion and would no doubt solve our problems," he said, "Now, which one of us will put the bell around the cat's neck?"	Honesty is the best policy.	Metaphoric-97

If you have a nostalgia store (or other shop that might have nostalgia candy), go there. For $18, you don't get a whole lot of candy. Yeah, some of it is really fantastic and delicious, but it seems to have just been repackaged from recent productions of the candy. The box is also somewhat small and contains that crinkle paper confetti stuff for effect (I guess?), but it takes up a lot of space in the box.In all: I wish there was enough candy to justify paying $18 for it, but there really wasn't.	Nostalgia candy is overpriced for the amount that you actually get.	Review-100
Better Than Milk powder is the best soy product on the market. It's great tasting, nutritious, and easy to use in other recipes. I can't even get it locally and a local store used to stock it.	Soy product - Better Than Milk powder, is tasty, nutritious and versatile.	Review-101
This product is not a gimmick. I was hesitant to spend yet more money on my Keurig coffee maker. I love the idea behind the Keurig, I dont have a issue with some of the k-cups but I really wanted the freedom to use Peets or Starbucks blends primarily.The my K cap works so much better then the my K cup that is made for Keurig.The my k cup filter is awful, it produces a watery cup of coffee that isnt really coffee at all, more like tea.My k cap is a much better solution for using your favorite coffee in your Keurig. Highly recommend.	My k cap is a great alternative to the Keurig K cup since you can use your favorite coffee.	Review-102

love this popcorn, just a hint of butteriness and not too salty. definitely not artificial tasting-because there is nothing artificial in it! that's why we eat it. popcorn has good fiber, and is a healthy snack not full of white flour or sugar.	This popcorn is not too buttery!	Review-105
I bought this product as part of my quest to find a really buttery topping for microwave popcorn. This is the third brand of oil that I have purchased and I think I will keep looking.What one gets is a thick, creamy emulsion with a faint buttery taste. I found pronounced creamy overtones in a raw tasting. It will slightly separate on standing so, even though the label does not say so, Shake Well Before Using.As expected, adding this oil to freshly popped popcorn produces an oily, semi-creamy, and very slightly buttery finished product. Adding plain popping salt completes the process for a very likeable popcorn.This product is not in the same class a movie-theater style popcorn, but would easily satisfy someone looking for an alternative flavor profile. The creamy texture of the oil gives the finished popcorn a nice, silky mouth-feel.	In my quest to find a really buttery topping for microwave popcorn, I discovered that the oil, the salt you use and to shake well before serving are important factors to obtain that fragrant silky buttery taste.

This coffee doesn't taste good at all. I cannot even describe what I am really tasting, but it doesn't taste like coffee or vanilla coffee.

If you like a tangy bite to sweetness in candy, these are worth the buy. They have the consistency of a fruit chew inside, with a thick coating of dark chocolate that's not cloyingly sweet. Quite filling, too. I've seen other products by this company, but this candy seems to be a seasonal item and not so easily found in stores; it was nice to be able to buy it online.	A type of candy that can be purchased online is filling, not too sweet and has fruit chew inside.	Review-110
We just discovered these and can't live without them as an emergency snack for the car, purse and in backpacks - the protein is what fills you up when you're starving, and will keep you full, vs. another snack that isn't worth the calories. 200 calories, 9 grams protein, 27 grams carbs and 6 grams fat - carbs are high but worth it. Super high protein and they are very light. I found them cheaper at a local store ($6 for 6), but they sell out quickly so I've had to order from amazon. The other Oskri bars are tasty, but low in protein, so we only get the ones labelled protein bars. Happy to finally find a bar that everyone likes, with a light texture - other protein bars we've tried have been chemical tasting or gross flavors.	We love the Oskri protein bars because they are a perfect on the go snack!	Review-111
Kitchens of India is the closest to a homemade curry we have ever had. We love it. The sauce is great and it is fast, so curry a few times a week is possible. We often make a curry from scratch but it is time consuming and now we can have a good curry whenever we want. We have also tried the Rogan Josh as well as the Korma. Add some onions and raisins, or a bit of honey. The ingredients have little or no preservatives. The Best!!	I checked the expiration date which is two years from now.	Review-112

I have searched for a natural diet soda that I like, but kept going back to the nutrasweet diet sodas because of the variety. I recently discovered Zevia sodas (because of the Belly Fat Cure book/diet plan). I am SO happy with these sodas, especially the Dr. Zevia, it is very similar to the nutrasweet-sweetened dr soda, but without that very unhealthy sweetener.I have tried several of the Zevia soda flavors, and I like the cola, lemon lime and orange; the cream soda and black cherry flavors are really, really good. The Mountain Zevia tastes nothing like its nutrasweet counterpart (I thought it tasted much like the Airborne cold medicine).	Nutrasweet soda taste like cold medicine.	Review-114

Not only does this tea aid in digestion, but it worked wonders on my 10 year old daughter's sore throat. She was experiencing moderate pain, and after trying Ibuprofen and Lozenges, I made her this tea. I added honey, and the tea had an instant effect. She claims that it did something to numb her throat. She continuted drinking it every night through the course of her cold. I am so pleased to have found this product! Excellent tea!

Light and tasty, probably the best feature of this carbonated juice is that it does not have any added sugar. Apple Juice is sweet enough as it is. It also features some added vitamins but ultimately, I was taken by the slightly tart taste and the 90 calories per 8.4 ounce can. Very reasonable. So go ahead and get this product for your kids (and yourself). It beats soda, cool aid, and many so called juice drinks that are mostly sugar and water with 10% or so actual juice.	This juice is only 90 calories per 8.4 oz can.	Review-121
Below is the review for regular white granulated sugar twin, i bought the brown at the same time, after making the cake i tasted the brown sugar and it had the same off taste. Ive been following the Atkins plan and have been trying various no calorie sweeteners trying to find my favorite. I made a cake with this and it was awful, i used 1 cup in the recipe for the whole cake, which i have done before with splenda. I tried Sugar twin because it is a lot cheaper. The whole cake was in-edible, it had a very sweet chemical like taste. even after adding frosting it was awful and left my stomach in knots. I recommend splenda or ez sweetz. Cheers!	Dietary sugar alternatives have recently been questioned as to their actual health benefits, even being accused of being derogatory to one's health.	Review-122
Blue Agave sweetener is the best I've ever used. Been using it for over a year now, and has assisted in helping me lose the weight I've needed to. Compared to using regular sugar as a sweetener, I only have to use 3 teaspoons of Blue Agave, whereas, I would have to use a minimum of 5-6 teaspoons of sugar to get the equivalent taste. Blue Agave does not cause an increase in blood sugar like real sugar can.I use this on other foods such as, pancakes, waffles, as an ice cream topping and to sweeten just about anything one would normally use sugar for.You can't go wrong with Blue Agave.	Blue Agave sweetener assists weight loss and you can use less than regular sugar and there are health benefits too because you can use it as a sugar substitute in a lot of food and drink.	Review-123
These were perfect for medium-sized canned escarot. I could bake them in these shells, so it makes an impressive treat. Be aware most cans of snails this size (appropriate for these shells) will contain 20 or so snails. One of the shells I received was rather brittle, and I am concerned about serving it, afraid some could come off into the food.	I really liked the Mango one so I tried the blackberry/pomegranate one and liked it less.	Review-124
I sampled the marinade at St. Jean winery in CA, bought a bottle ($1 more than at Amazon), and intended to make the chicken salad recipe on the label of the marinade. Eventually I asked my friend Jean, an excellent cook, to make the chicken salad for me. She doubled the recipe, and followed the directions on the bottle exactly. We both thought the result was fabulous. I'll buy it again even though it's on the expensive side. The chicken salad was terrific. It is definitely worthy of serving to company. I love the distictive flavor of this sauce.	I bought a rather expensive marinade from a winery in CA but my friend and I loved the chicken salad that we made from the recipe on the side of the bottle!	Review-125
I love salt water taffy and thought I recognized the Sweets brand name. It comes in 3 nice 1-lb boxes and is melt-in-your-mouth soft - no chewing required. The colors are bright and unusual for taffy. But this is not traditional taffy as far as the flavors. They are almost all a little weird, hard to define and kind of awful, in my opinion. I can tolerate the blue, the chocolate and peppermint taste accurate but the others are kind of unnatural, some with weird petroleum/chemical aftertastes. They are all much sweeter than I had expected as well. So I won't be reordering this brand. I like the flavor and price of the Energy Club brand sold on amazon, so I'll probably just go back to that.	Sweets salt water taffy is a soft, brightly coloured taffy with predominantly unusual and unnatural, overly sweet flavourings, therefore less appetizing than the Energy Club brand.	Review-126
These organic buckwheat groats are easy to toast and cook. I enjoy them combined with cabbage, carrots and onions. They make wonderful salads, too, and at the price, they are a real bargain.

I received the Krupps coffee maker for Mother's day this year, and have used it daily since. It makes an excellent cup of coffee; the very best I've ever had with these single serving machines.The coffees are much better than the 'milk' pods that come with some of them; I won't be buying any more of those.The only complaint I've had with this is that Macy's is the only store I can find this in; otherwise, I have to order the coffee online. (And Macy's has had the coffee on sale, so I'm afraid that may not last much longer.)	Coffee is a caffeinated drink, very popular with the Italian culture.	Review-129
This is the best thing I have done for my health. This organic delicious, slightly coconut flavored oil is all I use: to fry, to 'butter,' as an ingredient, for my face and skin. Wondrous! I can even eat peanut butter sandwiches every day--with coconut oil spread on sprouted bread--and not gain weight, put on fat! Yahoo! Just google 'benefits of coconut oil,' then buy a quality brand. Thank you Nutiva!	I get nutty for coconut oil.	Review-130
I have tried all of the Gracious Gourmet products and can't find a single one that isn't fantastic! The best part of these spreads is that you can use them so many different ways.

I rate this sauce as hot as 357 Silver edition and Da Bomb ground zero. It is supposedly hotter than Blairs hottest (non-a.m.) sauce, Ultra Death. I have a bottle of Ultra Death and I love it, but it still is not as hot as this. These Zack Wylde sauces feature the same great quality and taste that you would come to expect with all the Blair Products. I cannot believe how unpopular it is! try it, you won't be disappointed!	Humans have used hot spices and chili peppers for thousands of years to spice up their food.	Review-132
It is almost impossible to find this dressing in the stores anymore!

One of my favorite types of K-cups. Very good in the morning or as an after dinner coffee. There is a subtle chocolate flavor, but this coffee is not bitter like most flavored coffees usually are.	K cup coffee, good in the morning, good in the evening, adds a subtle chocolate flavor which cancels any bitterness.	Review-139
This is the tastiest protein drink I've ever had. I'm particularly sensitive to the taste of most of protein drinks and can't handle them as they are so dense to drink. This one is great and doesn't have the after taste of other products. I have tried it both hot and cold and they were both great.	Being sensitive to the density of liquid products, I am usually wary of protein drinks.	Review-140
This is a convenient snack to take on the run for the children. It is made out of all fruit juice concentrate and does not have any added sugar (corn syrup, etc). My 14month old and 3 year old both love them. They do leave a sticky face and hands, but that is easy to clean.	This is a convenient healthy fruit snack for kids.	Review-141
This coffee will make you smile each time you take your first sip. It is a favorite over all instants and most brewed coffees. It is smooth, rich, and presents no after-taste with just the right amount of caffeine. It provides a lift to get the creative spirit and physical energies flowing. The moment my box of six bottles arrived I felt like a child on Christmas morning.I do not spend money frivolously and this is no exception. The quality of this coffee, along with the low per cup cost, is so outstanding that it puts this purchase in the can't go wrong bargain class. Four of the six bottles will be gifts when visiting friends and relatives this summer, like a fine bottle of wine but providing many more tasteful moments for weeks to come.	Coffee is toxic to some insects such as slugs but it has a different effect on bees. In fact, it is believed bees get a 'buzz' from caffeine in the flowers of plants.	Review-142
Just like canned crab, this lobster may be lobster but the taste and texture of canned is nasty. In no way does it resemble the fresh product. Do not waste money for this. Better buy fresh or frozen.	It's even better in a modified Manhattan.	Review-143
This tasted old and dry - I found it to taste stale, like old, instant coffee. It was a disappointment because I got this machine for my son to take to college, and had hoped the coffees would taste good.I am still hopeful that other manufacturers will start to make capsules for this machine. But, currently, this is probably the strongest flavor available, and is just not very flavorful.	I am disappointed in this capsule because it's not very flavorful.	Review-144
I try to drink several cups of green tea every day, and I like a little variety in flavor. The Jasmine Blossom flavor is subtle and light. I used to be able to find this in stores, but I can't find any local stores that carry it now. This is really good tea, and buying in bulk makes it less expensive than purchasing the individual bags.	I now buy my favorite green Jasmine Blossom tea in bulk because it is no longer sold in most stores, but I save money this way!	Review-145
Peanut lovers rejoice! This is one chewy, nutty, delicious treat. It's bigger than those granola/power/protein bars and loaded with peanuts on top of a peanut buttery/yogurty base that's sweet but not too sweet. This yummy snack is a good source of protein - and fat. At 220 calories, it's not for the dieter, but is tasty and satisfying. Highly recommended.	It was a damper.	Review-146
I grew up in south India drinking coconut water regularly. The brands that come from Brazil taste more like natural coconut water. Not this one. This more tastes like the tender coconut meat blended into the coconut water.	This particular Brazilian coconut water drink tastes not only like nature but has a tender sensation of the coco pulp.	Review-147
This tea is amazing! One of the ingredients (I'm guessing slippery elm) totally coats an irritated throat, and also tastes sweet in the back of your mouth. The first ingredient is licorice, but it doesn't taste like licorice -- the blend of flavors is delicious.	When I have a cold, I drink warm tea.	Review-148
I started feeding my over-weight cat Wellness canned and stopped all other foods including any dry. No more vomiting, no more shedding like crazy, no more begging for food all day long and waking me up in the night. She's lost a little bit (not much), but she looks great and I have not stepped in a pile of vomit in months.Love this food!!

When I got the cereal, I was excited because I got it for so much cheaper than the grocery store charge. but the cereal tasted a little stale. Not sure if it was just this one box. I'll get another box just to make sure.	These do not make them cough at all.	Review-150
I've always loved amaretto, but it was unavailable in my locality.The beauty of it lies in the fact that it needs no refrigeration ( it stores between 35 and 80 degreesF) so you can buy in bulk.It is a little pricey, but worth it to me.	Any perishable food that have been above 40 degrees F for over 2 hours should be discarded.	Review-151
What a yummy coffee, strong but not bitter, full flavor but not dense, and you can choose your roasting preference (I chose dark). Cute packaging too, for those of us who care! It's shipped directly, and I got the package within 2 days. Try it, you'll like it!	It's not a horrible smell, it's just something you have to get used to.	Review-152
I love this coffee, but what is with these prices? My local walmart sells it for $3.00 and some time on sale for $2.50 and here its like $4.15 each? why is that? and why would any one buy it from here?	Good coffee is overpriced at $4.15, compared to Walmart at $3.00 with a sale price of $2.50.	Review-153
This tastes amazing! The only thing is that I wish there was a little more piney and/or peppermint/menthol taste to them. It has a wonderful soft center with very little aftertaste, unlike any other cough drops I have ever tried. They ALL have an aftertaste and dry my mouth out a little.	There is neither a before or after taste with these cough drops.	Review-154
I started buying Henry and Lisa's Tuna about a year ago and it was excellent. It was seriously a solid tuna loin in a can that had no fishy smell- you can't beat that. Unfortunately it's gotten progressively less quality with each shipment. At first there was some less quality filler tuna around the edges, and now it seems the cans more frequently only contain the less quality meat. Some of the glowing reviews here are from about a year ago and in my experience the product has changed since then.It is still better than most other brands that I have tried and it's the only tuna I can eat without having to hide the smell and taste with tons of condiments. The extra cost of the tuna is partially offset by what I save in condiments. I'm giving it 4 stars for the BPA -free can, dolphin safe, and that it's still comparatively good tuna.	Tuna is one of the most widely eaten fish in the world, often served as a steak or in a can.	Review-155

I was first introduced to this truffle salt a few years ago when my sister sent me a jar for a gift. After the jar was used, (I love it sprinkled on my homemade pizza!) I bought a couple other jars of different brands in a local gourmet shoppe, but neither was as good as FungusAmongUs. I purchased a third brand from an online gourmet shop...still not as flavorful. I was so glad to finally find FungusAmongUs on Amazon at a very reasonable price (compared to what I had paid for others). The jar arrived in a few days. I made my pizza and opened the jar...oh, the delight! Lots of Truffle specs and that same delicious flavor I remembered from a few years back. Thank you Amazon and thank you FungusAmongus!	Homemade pizza is a great alternative to ordering pizza because it saves you quite a bit of money!	Review-157
This is a very flavorful tea. The pomegranate flavor comes through. It isn't as earthy as plain green tea. It is fruity. I don't feel like I'm missing anything a traditional tea bag has to offer. I've made green tea using whole leaf, tea bags and k-cups. The k-cup makes it all the more enjoyable because it is fast and there is no clean-up. I think the tea tastes fresh with every cup because it isn't like opening a box and having it sit around waiting for me to use the rest of it. I will definitely purchase this tea k-cup again.	I will make this many times and try the raisin and cinnamon additions mentioned on the box.	Review-158
Based on reviews, and the fact that I have NOT loved any of the many Timothy coffees I've tried (but I keep trying b/c of the fab prices here!), I was not expecting to like this at all. But I love Bailey's Irish Cream so I ordered a single k-cup of this flavor (from another website). What a lovely surprise! It really does taste like it has a shot of Bailey's in it, and the coffee underneath is quite tasty as well, at least, it doesn't get in the way of the Bailey's taste! I will be ordering the 2 box pack from here!	Cocktails are a combination of one or more alcohols, mixed with a soft drink/and or other ingredients to create a unique, excitingly flavoured drink.

Pacific Chai coconut Chai Latte is so good. I have a cup every morning with my coconut oil in it. Also getting it through Amazon is much cheaper than at the store. I live about an hour from any grocery store and so it is nice to be able to have it shipped to my door.	Amazon brings my favorite Pacific coconut Chai Latte right to my door at a lower price!

These treats are well liked by dogs, the right size and don't smell or feel too gross in your hands. Not really sure what else to say about them except that if organic is important to you, then these seem to be one of the few options for dog treats out there. I will buy them again.	Organic dog treats have good texture and feel.	Review-161
A bit skeptical, I purchased some flavored salt as a gift and got this one for myself.It turns out the smokiness adds a nice dimension of flavor, especially to soups like split pea or to a recipe for BBQ sauce. Worth a try!	I bought flavoured salt for myself and I think its worth a try!	Review-162
I like the convenience and taste of all Suddenly Salad products. However, this Chipotle Ranch is my favorite. It has just the right amount of zing without going overboard. It's creamy and flavorful. It didn't take my family long to go through a pack of 12! I highly recommend it!	Chipotle Ranch Suddenly Salad creamy and zingy salad dressing is a recommended family favourite.	Review-163

My husband and I both enjoyed the flavor of this tea so much! We often receive oolong tea from our relatives in Taiwan as a present, but we have not been to Taiwan for a while so we ran out. I ordered this tea hoping to fill the gap until our next trip. It is of good quality with nothing but large whole leaves. It has a delicate flavor and lovely aroma. It is as good as the high mountain oolong tea we get in Taiwan. I would recommend this tea to anyone who loves oolong tea or is interested in trying it.	My husband and I ran out of our favorite tea.	Review-165
Just had my first cup of this tea today. I use milk and sugar in my tea and while it is a good tea, there is a slight bitter aftertaste. And no, I did not leave it sit on the grounds too long. I wish I could have bought one canister at a time instead of three. Not sure I will be able to go through all that tea. However I do applaud the enlightened owner of the plantation according to the written information which came with the tea. I only would like to enjoy the taste of the tea more.	The coffee started to drip and my kitchen started smelling very nice which gave me high hopes for a very nice cup of coffee.	Review-166
I love Eden chocolate soymilk heated for hot chocolate. Doesn't need refrigeration, not too sweet (and no refined sugar), just the right amount of chocolaty, creamy texture. I love the individual packages so that I can have hot chocolate occasionally without having an entire container to use up. Check the label on the cocoa mix you're using and you'll want to make a shift fast! First time it tasted different - though not unpleasantly so - than traditional hot chocolate, but I tried it again and now it's my go to hot chocolate!	Eden chocolate flavoured soymilk comes in individual packets and makes for a healthier, alternative version of a tasty, creamy hot chocolate, without needing refrigeration.	Review-167
For the 3 seconds the flavor lasts (the outside strawberry flavored gum mixed with a lime liquid center) it's pretty enjoyable. After that, it's all downhill. Not since chewing Fruit Strips gum as a child, can I remember a gum losing flavor this quickly. You maybe get 5-10 minutes of flavor and after that it's like chewing rubber.The packaging is another annoyance it's a foil blister pack with a cardboard sleeve containing nine pieces of gum. It's a waste of packaging if you consider the whole thing could have been put in a Mentos-like package.I made the mistake of buying a 3 pack. If you must, go with a single pack. It will be enough to turn you off.	Fruit Strips chewing gum quickly loses flavour and the packaging is wasteful.	Review-168

I've never been one to like jams or preserves. I thought I'd try this one though because I do like ginger. This is DELICIOUS!! Not too overpowering from the ginger(like some of the other ginger jam blends out there), and not too tangy or sour from the rhubarb; it's just perfect! I will definitely buy this one again. I love it on toast for breakfast with a cup of coffee or as an afternoon snake with a cup of tea.	Eating breakfast is usually associated with lower body weight and improved academic performance.	Review-171
The liquid smells of chemicals and the clams taste the same. I doubt these are safe to eat. Either the clams themselves, or the waters they are packed in, are coming from some polluted source. Since Amazon won't take responsibility to refund on these, I am throwing them into the municipal waste.	I'm mostly vegetarian (I try to avoid as much meat as I can), and I love savory and spicy foods.	Review-172
Great taste without the kick of regular java. I miss the buzz, but not the acidity. For anyone who suddenly has to stop drinking coffee either temporarily or long-term, this will work.

This energy drink is extremely hard to find.I called Hansen's to find it. It is made in small amounts at a time with great ingredients, natural.It's the only energy drink my husband and I drink. It's pricey but worth it.	Energy drinks contain water, sugar and caffeine, but very high doses of caffeine can cause health problems.	Review-174
My fiance' loves fortune cookies so I figured this would be a great creative way to pop the question. Well, she loved the idea when I finally did it last friday (although, somehow she had me figured out from the beginning lol).Anyway, I wasn't particularly thrilled about the quality of these cookies. The seams weren't completely shut. I could see the word Will through the backside of the cookie.Also, a huge warning for someone looking for an authentic cookie to give.... the wrapper is just that, a plain plastic wrapper. I was expecting some Chinese lettering or some kind of design to make it a little more believeable.And last but not least, the price. For the quality you're getting, I'd be more inclined to try the trick (tutorials online) of opening up a cookie and placing the message inside myself. At least then I could put exactly what I wanted. They are way overpriced for what you're getting.Buy only out of desperation.	The fortune cookie came in a plastic wrapper instead of an authentic Chinese wrapper which was disappointing.	Review-175
I just received this today in the mail, and tried out my first cup. Much to my surprise, the taste was very good, and I hardly needed any sweetener to actually drink it. This has spearmint and kombucha in it, and I don't know what major effect those had on the tea overall, but I'm fully aware of additional benefits it can provide. I actually like this way better than the Celestial Seasonings green tea. This tastes more authentic and it's organic which is a big thing for me. I'll definitely have to recommend this to anyone I know who drinks green tea. So far, so good with this one. Thanks Amazon for carrying this.	First try of spearmint and kombucha green tea from Amazon which is healthier, tastier, organic, and better than other brands.	Review-176
Catnip doesn't affect all cats the same. Mine, a mother and her two daughters, all seem to be immune to the effects. The product smells strong so I am assuming it would work well for other cats.

The chocolate chips give this delectible shortbread cookie a great twist. Highly recommend this cookie but these cookies are somewhat fragile and don't travel all that well in the mail to their final destination so expect some of the cookies to arrive broken but taste great all the same.	I switched to decaf coffee a while back and was looking for a great sampler pack.	Review-178
I use a lot of boullion. Until I found these little cubes of goodness, I used Better than Boullion, mostly chicken flavored which is great but I'm not so in love with some of the ingredients even though I use the organic version. The veggie boullion cubes from Gourmet Organic are absolutely delicious and I feel good about using them.	I like using the veggie boullion cubes from Gourmet Organic because they're delicious and I feel better about the ingredients!	Review-179
I really like the hazelnut coffee. If you are looking for strong coffee this is not it. There is a bolder version and that might be more suited to you. But this is really good coffee.

If you like carob and you like baking, this is an excellent product. You can substitute this in any recipe that calls for molasses and it will add a rich carob flavor. It's not quite as sweet as regular molasses so you may have to adjust recipes accordingly (some people recommend substituting 1/4 of the molasses with honey).I had no problems with the shipping, all jars arrived intact and without leaking.	This product can be used to substitute carob in any recipe that needs it. It has rich flavour however is not quite as sweet.	Review-182
This cereal is great! Finally, I can get it without driving around hoping that it will be in stock where I've seen it before. That has been tough. Better yet-- it is less expensive on Amazon!

Overall a nice blend, but given the different sizes of the seeds, the sprouting ratio was a bit mixed. Taste was good, might prefer the seeds not in a blend, which is what I will try the next time I buy seeds. Used them with the sprout house and it worked well.	The use of a sprouting hose is most effective when watering seeds yet the sprouting rate will vary according to the size of each seed.	Review-184

Every review I'd read of this pasta was glowing, so we thought we'd try it. I've been gluten free for almost two years, and so far, we've tried Trader Joe's, Tinkyada, Schar, Bionaturae, and Le Veneziane pastas. We assumed Jovial would quickly become our favorite. Instead, we found it somewhat disappointing. The flavor is very nice, but the texture was disappointingly similar to the other brown rice pastas we'd tried. We were careful to follow the timing recommendations on the box too. I have several more boxes, so if I make Jovial again with better results, I'll update this review. Meanwhile, our favorite pasta remains Le Veneziane.	Pasta and pizza are two of the main Italian dietary staples.	Review-186
These Lara bars are absolutely delicious! A great healthful alternative to a candy bar.

Great mints, not too strong with rich dark chocolate. Unfortunately, they are overpriced by 400% here. That's right - they are only $1.39 in the supermarket. Which leads me to believe their other products are also overpriced here. No sale.	The mints are good but I believe a lot of products are overpriced here.	Review-188
I received about a teaspoon of kefir grains in the mail a little more than a week ago. They have since multiplied into well over a tablespoon. I've bought several kefir cultures before and none ever grew nearly that quickly. These grains make a good potent kefir too! This can also be used to make a very flavorful, yummy cheese. Be sure to follow the seller's instructions closely, as these little buggers are potent!The flavor of this is much stronger than store-bought kefir. If you aren't used to the taste you can try mixing it with fruit juice.If you end up with too many grains, and can't give them away, you can eat the extras. They're good with honey. (If you're not used to eating kefir grains you should start with a small amount.)If you have any problems, the seller is very nice and extremely helpful. Probably the nicest person I've dealt with on Amazon.	Kefir grains are a culture that once bought, can be multiplied at home.	Review-189
For someone who loves Girl Scout's Thin Mint cookies but are frustrated at the fact that you can't buy them just any time, Mint Oreos provides a satisfying replacement for the times you can't have a Thin Mint. When I first tried this, Thin Mints was the first thing to come to my mind, because the taste of chocolate, flour, and mint make for an awesome flavor. If you're a fan of Thin Mints or just mint-flavored stuff in general, give Mint Oreos a try, you won't be disappointed! And the mint filling is great to lick off the cookie! Yum!	Mint Oreos are a satisfying replacement for Girl Scout's Thin Mint cookies, which you cannot buy at any time of the year.	Review-190

I use all the dynamic health juice concentrates.Great way to get the benefits without the sugars.

I have always loved chocolate, very milky chocolate. Then I was diagnosed with a cow dairy allergy and thought I had to give up chocolate all together because I could never eat dark chocolate even with a very low percentage of cocoa, like the sugary dark chocolates. I was bold enough to try the 90% as my first dark chocolate bar and while it was way too bitter at first, it only took three squares before I was hooked. I loved the snap while also letting the square melt in my mouth. I started eating half a bar each day for a few weeks until I slowed myself down and had to switch to this 85% but it is still great. I also use it in baking cookies and it works really well. I usually order from whatever seller amazon lists on the product page, but wanted to comment on the direct shipment from amazon. I ordered these bars during 90 degree weather in southern CA and was worried they would arrive melted (couldn't resist, I needed my chocolate fix), but amazon shipped them with two ice packs surrounded by styrofoam at no additional charge. The packs were obviously melted by the time they arrived, but the chocolate was perfectly fine. Thank you amazon :).	If you find yourself hard up for a chocolate fix and have to ship chocolate in the heat, remember to use ice packs when posting.	Review-194
I've started buying Go Raw products. I'm not vegan but I don't eat most commercially processed foods because they're no longer natural. However Go Raw produces what I consider properly processed foods and for that I'm very grateful. I'm not fond of the two types of chips I've bought but I love, and will continue buying, their seeds.

I bought duck rillettes from Amazon because my usual favorite duck rillette was not carried anymore by chefshop.com. I was expecting a really good rillette. Full flavored rillette. What I got was a rellette that lacked even flavor of duck and herbs/spices. The texture was good however. Tasted more like a pork rillette. I would not recommend Rouge Perigord Duck Rillettes.	The ugly duckling is a fable in which the moral teaches the reader not to judge others on their appearance.	Review-196
These groats have worked out very well for sprouting and I have been able to make wonderful buckwheat waffles from the flour created from the ground, sprouted groats. The lid seals well, so there should not be any problems regarding freshness. The quality of the groats is very good- I have not found any off groats. Whenever the time comes that I actually get through all five pounds, I would definitely purchase this product again!	When I first opened the bag, I was thrown off by the strong aroma, somewhat reminiscent of sage.	Review-197

This location had many natural attributes in its favor. Twenty-seven kilometers (17 miles) long and less than a kilometer wide, the island is shaped like the number seven, and separated from the Yucatán peninsula by only 10 m (33 ft) of water. Its eastern shoreline is one long beach of fine white sand (there are seven named beaches along the strip), which is washed by the translucent azure waters of the Caribbean.

Guilin was settled more than 2,000 years ago when the Ling canal was built, effectively linking the great Yangzi and Pearl rivers. Guilin’s connection with one of mankind’s most ambitious engineering projects was important, but otherwise little was heard from the town.

The Beijing Hutong Tourist Agency (Tel. 6615-9097), which books tours through hotel desks, has a fleet of red-canopied pedicabs led by an English-speaking guide. Its hutong tour combines many of the sights in the Back Lakes District with the opportunity to step inside a courtyard house and talk with its modern-day residents.	Tour guides are employed to inform and guide a group of tourists around a site of interest, usually with a specifically advanced knowledge of the site's history, culture, layout etc.	Travel-215
The most significant expedition under Manuel’s flag was Vasco da Gama’s legendary sea voyage from Lisbon in the summer of 1497 — immortalized in The Lusiads (1572), the epic poem by Portugal’s national poet, Luís de Camões (1524–1580). Rounding what is now known as the Cape of Good Hope, da Gama found what Columbus had been searching for in 1492 (although in the wrong direction): the sea-route to the lucrative spices of the East. The Portuguese thus ended the Venetian monopoly on Eastern trade and began attracting merchants from all over Europe to Lisbon.	The Lusiads, written in 1572, is an epic poem by the Portuguese poet, Luís de Camões.	Travel-216
Back on the mainland, a turn-off of the main road east (EN-125, still!) of Tavira leads a small number of visitors to Cacela Velha, a perfectly enchanting little white-washed village overlooking the sea. It has an 18th-century church, a telephone booth, a cemetery, an old well, and a handful of well-tended, blue-and-white houses festooned with flowers.	The Enlightenment saw the rise and cultivation of philosophy and science during the 18th, specifically during the French and American Revolutions.	Travel-217
West of the oldest sections and intimate streets of Old Havana is an area of wide boulevards and grand palaces. The loveliest avenue, the Prado (formally known as Paseo de Martí), runs from Parque Central to the sea. Grand but run-down buildings, with fading flamingo-pink and lime-green façades and ornate columns, flank a raised promenade of laurels, gas lamps, and marble benches. In the 19th century this was the city’s most fashionable strolling ground. Now it serves as a minipark for habaneros (as Havana’s citizens are called), from coupling lovers and children playing on homemade skateboards to parading prostitutes.

Follow the long avenue de la Grande-Armée down from l’Etoile and the battery of towers looms bigger and bigger beyond the elegant, leafy suburb of Neuilly. Cross the river and you are in a mini-Manhattan that has sprouted since 1969 to become a city in its own right. In the process, it has somehow managed to get a soul, in spite of the inhuman scale of some of its windswept spaces.

Start on top of the rock, where the city’s principal landmark is a hotel, the Château Frontenac, looming over the town since 1892 like the protective fortress it no longer needs. Because of its dramatic location and the fairytale turrets of its Gothic-Renaissance architecture, the Frontenac is one of the most charmingly bombastic of all the many grand hotels that the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National railways put up across the country as symbols of their commercial power. It is named after Count Louis de Frontenac, a rascally 17th-century French governor who upset the clergy by encouraging the sale of brandy to the native peoples. Take a look inside at the stucco carvings, tapestries, and handsome wood paneling.	The Chateau Frontenac is one of the most charming, fairytale-like hotels put up by the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National railways.	Travel-220
Greece was invaded by Nazi Germany in April 1941; by June the Germans controlled the entire country, with Italian forces placed in Athens. The people suffered greatly, but the city’s monuments escaped serious damage. Unfortunately, the Greek resistance movement formed during the war was so politically divided that the guerrillas expended almost as much energy fighting each other as against the Germans. In October 1944, the Allied forces moved into Athens and much of Greece, encountering little opposition from the retreating Germans.	The Greek resistance movement during WWII was plagued by divisive factions.	Travel-221
Much of restored Old Havana is concentrated in only a few blocks at the eastern end of these streets. On the corner of Mercaderes and Obispo is the recently renovated, 1920s-era Hotel Ambos Mundos; Hemingway lived on and off in room 511 for a couple of years during the 1930s. The room contains original artifacts from Hemingway’s many years in Cuba, including the typewriter he used to write most of For Whom the Bell Tolls (those not staying in the hotel can visit the room for US$2).

Tour agencies offer excursions from Kuta, Sanur, and the other resorts.	The view from the terrace of downtown Beijing, the Forbidden City, and Tiananmen Square is superb.	Travel-223
Almost too perfect to be true, the high medieval walls of Óbidos completely encircle a jewel of a town. Equally hard to believe, this inland town was once a port and coastal fortress until the sea inlet here silted up, leaving the quiet Óbidos lagoon cut off and the shoreline nearly 10 km (6 miles) away.

The Islamic Museum in the Pergamon’s south wing exhibits the grand façade of the 8th-century Palace of Mshatta (from what is now modern Jordan). It is embellished with intricately incised or perforated animal and plant motifs. In fact, a German art historian rescued this tour de force of early Islamic decoration at the turn of the century by persuading the Sultan of Turkey not to use it as building material for a railway link to Mecca. He made quite a save! Among the other precious exhibits you will find some exquisite Indian Mogul miniatures.	The emperor’s bedroom is located in the Refreshing Mist-Veiled Waters Pavilion.

Continue south towards Agaete, which is the most attractive of the small northern towns. Agaete’s port, Puerto de las Nieves, is a haven of calm among the formidable rocky cliffs that make up this inhospitable stretch of coast. From here the coast road ascends very sharply amid sparse, windblown greenery, and the drop seawards can be frighteningly steep. An alternative route is to drive 7 km (4 miles) inland to the fine viewpoint at Los Berrazales.

During the American Revolution, New Orleans plunged in on the revolutionist side. It wasn’t only enthusiasm for the Yankees; Spain declared war on England in 1779. The governor of New Orleans, 23-year-old Don Bernardo de Gálvez, seized the chance to help the colonists in their struggle against George III, and led raiding parties that kept the British outposts along the Mississippi on the defensive.

There’s not that much to do or see on the seven islands that make up Boston Harbor Islands State Park, but an afternoon spent here offers gentle strolls, picnics, and bird-watching — a welcome respite from urban frenzy. From May to mid-October, the Boston Harbor Cruise Company (Tel. 723-7800) operates a ferry from Long Wharf to Georges Island, the core of the group. Fort Warren, a 19th-century star-shaped fortress in which Confederate prisoners were incarcerated during the Civil War occupies most of the island. It’s an atmospheric and spooky place, with old gun emplacements, lookout posts, and chilly alleys.

The atmospheric and intensely Portuguese village of Monsanto, located about 50 km (31 miles) to the northeast of Castelo Branco, balances on a dramatic rocky outcrop between massive boulders. The streets are too narrow for cars, but a short walk to the castle at the top is worth the effort for the impressive stonework and the view. A beautiful, but roofless, 13th-century Romanesque church can also be seen. A new pousada has just opened here.

Spaniards have earned a reputation as consummate partiers, and while Barcelona may not be as fanatical about late nights as Madrid, it is still a place that really swings when the sun goes down. It has virtually every kind of nightlife diversion, from cool cabarets to live jazz, rock, flamenco, and world beat to opera, and a thriving bar and disco scene. At night, some streets, like the Rambla and Passeig de Gràcia, become slow-moving rivers of strollers.

From the Parc de l’Esplanade, drive up the Côte de la Citadelle hill road and through a tunnel for a guided tour around a powerful bastion of fears long gone. The French built the starshaped Citadel in 1750 to resist the British. The British enlarged it in 1820 to defend Québec City against the Americans, but their cannons never fired a shot in anger. The garrison was British-manned for only 20 years before being handed over to Canadian troops. Today it is the home of Canada’s crack Royal 22nd Regiment.

On carrer d’Aragó between Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla de Catalunya is the Fundació Antoni Tàpies, a museum dedicated to the work of Spain’s foremost living artist, the abstract materialist from Catalonia. In addition to Tàpies’s work, the Fundació has interesting rotating international exhibits, but at least half the reason to visit is to see the gorgeous 1880 Domènech i Montaner building that houses the museum (one of the first examples of modernisme) and Tàpies’s whimsical, tangled wire sculpture (called “Cloud and Chair”) on the roof.

In typical North American style, Toronto’s ethnic communities move around as they grow more affluent or as new construction pushes them out. The high-rises and parking garages behind the New City Hall forced Chinatown to move west. This is the largest Chinatown in Canada, if not in all of North America. The community has set up restaurants, hardware stores, and herbal medicine shops along Dundas Street and Spadina Avenue. Look in at the pagoda-roofed China Court shops grouped around a little Chinese garden.

The Iron Hypothesis has been considered as a means of global engineering, because a small amount of hematites (micrometre-sized iron particles) could potentially have a considerable effect on the atmosphere. "Give me a half a tanker of iron and I'll give you the next ice age," Martin once said jokingly. The reality may be much more modest: tests in 2002 suggested that between 10,000 and 100,000 carbon atoms are sunk for each iron atom added to the water, which means that it might be possible to sequester 1 billion tonnes of CO2 for as little as 30,000 tonnes of iron. To put this number into perspective, this is about 10% of CO2 humans have produced in year 2011 alone.	Though micrometer-sized iron particles can have drastic effects on atmosphere, their extent of pollution is negligable in comparison to CO2 made by humans.	Scientific-388

In asexual reproduction, an individual can reproduce without involvement with another individual of that species.

It was rightly assumed from the start of the Framingham Heart Study that cardiac health can be influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors, and by inheritance. The Framingham Heart Study is the origin of the term risk factor. Before the Framingham Heart Study, doctors had little sense of prevention.

The electrical resistivity of a metallic conductor decreases gradually as temperature is lowered and at the same time its conductivity becomes infinite. Thus a current in a superconductor flows without any change in magnitude. In ordinary conductors, such as copper or silver, this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects.

In biodiversity studies, the checkerboard score or C-score is a statistic which determines the randomness of the distribution of two or more species through a collection of biomes. The statistic, first published by Stone and Roberts in 1990, expands on the earlier work of Diamond that defined a notion of "checkerboard distributions" as an indicator of species competition.	First published by Stone and Roberts in 1990, the checkerboard score extends statistics in earlier biodiversity research to reflect the randomness of the distribution of two or more species through a set of biomes.

Submarine channels and their flanking levees are commonly referred to as channel levee systems (Flood and Damuth, 1987). They are significant geomorphological features that may run for thousands of kilometres across the ocean floor. Often, they coalesce and overlap to form channel levee complexes which are the building blocks of many major submarine fans. (Kane, 2010) This makes them one of several geological processes responsible for the transport of coarse grained sediment into deep water as well as being a chief conduit for the transfer of carbon from continental shelf to the deeper parts of the continental margins. (Bull et al., 2009; Frey- Martinez et al., 2005; Gee et al., 2006; Masson et al., 2006; Shipp et al., 2004).	Submarine channels are one of the reasons for the transportation of sediments into deep waters.	Scientific-404
The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, robotics has been often seen to mimic human behavior, and often manage tasks in a similar fashion.	The first electronic scanning format, 405 lines, was the first "high definition" television system, since the mechanical systems it replaced had far fewer.	Scientific-405
Adaptation to weightlessness involves not just the Sensory-motor coupling functions, but some autonomic nervous system functions as well. Sleep disorders and orthostatic intolerance are also common during and after spaceflight. There is no hydrostatic pressure in a weightless environment. As a result, the redistribution of body fluids toward the upper body causes a decrease in leg volume, which may affect muscle viscosity and compliance.	A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth.	Scientific-406
Most avian brood parasites will remove a host egg when they lay one of their own in a nest. Depending upon the species, this can happen either in the same visit to the host nest or in a separate visit before or after the parasitism. This both prevents the host species from realizing their nest has been parasitized and reduces competition for the parasitic nestling once it hatches.	To prevent the host species from detecting parasite eggs, avian brood parasites will replace the original egg with their own, keeping the same number at all times.	Scientific-407
Heat flux or thermal flux is the rate of heat energy transfer through a given surface. The SI derived unit of heat rate is joule per second, or watt. Heat flux is the heat rate per unit area. In SI units, heat flux is measured in W/m2. Heat rate is a scalar quantity, while heat flux is a vectorial quantity. To define the heat flux at a certain point in space, one takes the limiting case where the size of the surface becomes infinitesimally small.	Heat flux is the vectorial analog of the scalar heat rate, whereas heat rate is joules per second, heat flux is the heat rate per unit area, measured in W/m2.	Scientific-408
Iron oxides and oxide-hydroxides are widespread in nature, play an important role in many geological and biological processes, and are widely utilized by humans, e.g., as iron ores, pigments, catalysts, in thermite (see the diagram), Hemoglobin. Common rust is a form of iron(III) oxide. Iron oxides are widely used as inexpensive, durable pigments in paints, coatings and colored concretes. Colors commonly available are in the "earthy" end of the yellow/orange/red/brown/black range.	Iron oxides play an important role in biological processes in nature and in fact common rust is a type of iron oxide.	Scientific-409
The principle of faunal succession, also known as the law of faunal succession, is based on the observation that sedimentary rock strata contain fossilized flora and fauna, and that these fossils succeed each other vertically in a specific, reliable order that can be identified over wide horizontal distances. A fossilized Neanderthal bone will never be found in the same stratum as a fossilized Megalosaurus, for example, because neanderthals and megalosauruses lived during different geological periods, separated by many millions of years. This allows for strata to be identified and dated by the fossils found within.	Because fossils appear in a specific, vertical order in geological strata, the principle of faunal succession states that the reliable vertical order can be used to reliably date fossils, showing for example that a fossilized Megalosaurus and Neanderthal bones will never be found in the same stratum because the two lived during different geological periods.	Scientific-410
Historically, species have been classified into the binary categories of vocal learner or vocal non-learner based on their ability to produce novel vocalizations or imitate other species, with evidence from social isolation, deafening studies, and cross-fostering experiments. However, vocal learners exhibit a great deal of plasticity or variation between species, resulting in a spectrum of ability. The vocalizations of songbirds and whales have a syntactic-like organization similar to that of humans but are limited to Finite-State Grammars (FSGs), where they can generate strings of sequences with limited structural complexity.	Although species are typically divided into either vocal learner or non-learner according to their vocalization and imitation capabilities, vocal learns show a spectrum of capabilities, with some species such as song birds using limited syntactic constructions to produce vocal sequences with some structural complexity.	Scientific-411
As the ratio pyrometer came into popular use, it was determined that many materials, of which metals are an example, do not have the same emissivity at two wavelengths. For these materials, the emissivity does not cancel out and the temperature measurement is in error. The amount of error depends on the emissivities and the wavelengths where the measurements are taken.	The ratio pyrometer revealed that many materials do not have the same emissivity at two wavelengths, which causes errors in the temperature measurement.	Scientific-412
The area was first settled in the 19th century, by mostly Irish immigrants. The place may have been named after a prominent settler family, as religious records indicated the death of a certain Richard Shannon in 1831 and Simon Shannon the next year. Further impetus to its development came around 1850 when the timber industry began and in 1860 when a sawmill was built. Around 1861, about two thirds of the population was Irish, and by 1900, half the population.	The near side of the Moon is characterised by large dark areas that were believed to be seas by the astronomers who first mapped them.	Scientific-413
Not all modern notions of spirituality embrace transcendental ideas. Secular spirituality emphasizes humanistic ideas on moral character (qualities such as love, compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, responsibility, harmony, and a concern for others). These are aspects of life and human experience which go beyond a purely materialist view of the world without necessarily accepting belief in a supernatural reality or divine being.	The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were unknown to early players of musical instruments.	Scientific-414
Benthos are the organisms which live in the benthic zone, and are different from those elsewhere in the water column. Many are adapted to live on the substrate (bottom). In their habitats they can be considered as dominant creatures, but they are often a source of prey for Carcharhinidae such as the lemon shark. Many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure cannot survive in the upper parts of the water column. The pressure difference can be very significant (approximately one atmosphere for each 10 meters of water depth).	Organisms which live in the benthic zone of the ocean are called benthos, the dominant creatures in their habitat which are the main prey for carcharhinidae.	Scientific-415
Although its use was vital to cross the oceans, the Marine glass was not such an accurate instrument to measure the passage of time. Many factors could affect the duration of sand's flow: the humidity inside the "glass", the uniformity in fineness of the sand, the inner diameter of the connecting tube with a possible wear caused by the flow of sand, the more or less horizontal position, the effect of acceleration or deceleration of the ship's movements, all could influence the flow of sand and hence the time measured.	Maars are shallow, flat-floored craters that scientists interpret as having formed above diatremes as a result of a violent expansion of magmatic gas or steam; deep erosion of a maar presumably would expose a diatreme.	Scientific-416
The Ring of Fire is a direct result of plate tectonics and the movement and collisions of lithospheric plates. The eastern section of the ring is the result of the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate being subducted beneath the westward moving South American Plate. The Cocos Plate is being subducted beneath the Caribbean Plate, in Central America.	The volcanic activity surrounding the Pacific, known as the Ring of Fire, is due to plate techtonics in the lithosphere where the in the east, the Nazca and Cocos plates are being subducted by the South American and Caribbean plates.

A certain amount of land will inevitably be lost in this process while beaches are being built up resulting in settlements, farmland and other property being destroyed. Because of this, managed retreat is often not a socially acceptable plan and may invoke the need for compensation to land-owners. Intertidal sites are often a rich archaeological resource and the loss of heritage is a factor to be weighed in managed retreat projects.	Though managed retreat often create rich archaeological resources, the process does involve a loss of land, which can cause property destruction and possibly as a result, require monetary compensation to the owners.

In appropriate contexts, diatomic carbon can be viewed either as ethyne with two hydrogen atoms removed, ethene with four hydrogens removed, or as ethane with six hydrogens removed; and as such, ethynylidene, ethenediylidene, or ethanetriylidene, respectively, may be used as context-specific systematic names, according to substitutive nomenclature.	Valence bond theory predicts a quadruple bond as the only way to satisfy the octet rule for carbon.	Scientific-419
A visual binary star is a binary star for which the angular separation between the two components is great enough to permit them to be observed as a double star in a telescope, or even high-powered binoculars. The angular resolution of the telescope is an important factor in the detection of visual binaries, and as better angular resolutions are applied to binary star observations increasing number of visual binaries will be detected. The relative brightness of the two stars is also an important factor, as glare from a bright star may make it difficult to detect the presence of a fainter component.	A binary star is considered as a visual binary if its stars have relatively similar brightness and enough angular separation that can permit an observer to resolve them within a normal telescope.	Scientific-420
Fish measurement is the measuring of the length of individual fish and of various parts of their anatomy. These data are used in many areas of ichthyology, including taxonomy and fisheries biology.	Fish measurement is nothing but the process of measuring the dimensions of different parts of a fish.	Scientific-421
In UIT, ultrasonic waves are produced by an electro-mechanical ultrasonic transducer, and applied to a workpiece. An acoustically tuned resonator bar is caused to vibrate by energizing it with a magnetostrictive ultrasonic transducer. The energy generated from these high frequency impulses is imparted to the treated surface through the contact of specially designed steel pins. These transfer pins are free to move axially between the resonant body and the treated surface.	Ultrasonic impact treatment uses ultrasonic waves produced by an electro-mechanical ultrasonic transducer, which are applied to the treatment surface using metal pins.	Scientific-422
In addition to the general purpose, the study was designed to gather information to test specific hypotheses concerning demographic and socioeconomic differentials in fertility, the prevalence of contraceptive practice and the methods employed, the extent to which subfecundity and sterility may have contributed to low fertility, and the timing patterns and childbearing pace of the time. The interview collected information on each respondent's family planning, contraception usage, pregnancy history, fecundity, infertility, fertility, and maternal and infant health. Besides demographic characteristics and background information about the respondents, information was also gathered on their household composition, their husband(s), marriages, and areas of residency.	The simultaneous oscillation can be called plasmon hybridization where the tunability of the oscillation is associated with mixture of the inner and outer shell where they hybridize to give a lower energy or higher energy.

For skin prick tests, a tiny board with protruding needles is used. The allergens are placed either on the board or directly on the skin. The board is then placed on the skin, in order to puncture the skin and for the allergens to enter the body. If a hive appears, the person will be considered positive for the allergy. This test only works for IgE antibodies. Allergic reactions caused by other antibodies cannot be detected through skin prick tests.	Skin prick tests cannot be used for non-IgE antibodies.

Water bodies are often affected by geosmin and 2-Methylisoborneol, affecting the flavour of water for drinking and of fish growing in that water. Haloanisoles similarly affect water bodies, and are a recognised cause of off-flavour in wine. Cows grazing on weeds such as wild garlic can produce a ‘weedy’ off-flavour in milk.	The flavour of water and wine can be affected by Haloanisoles.	Scientific-425
For very precise work the pH meter should be calibrated before each measurement. For normal use calibration should be performed at the beginning of each day. The reason for this is that the glass electrode does not give a reproducible e.m.f. over longer periods of time. Calibration should be performed with at least two standard buffer solutions that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes buffers at pH 4.01 and pH 10.00 are acceptable.	The calibration of the pH meter should be done every morning.	Scientific-426
The causal effect of a treatment on a single unit at a point in time is the difference between the outcome variable with the treatment and without the treatment. The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that it is impossible to observe the causal effect on a single unit. You either take the aspirin now or you don't. As a consequence, assumptions must be made in order to estimate the missing counterfactuals.	Engine was originally a term for any mechanical device that converts force into motion.	Scientific-427
One caveat to this calculation is that the original work was concerned with the hydrography of the East China Sea, where cooling plays the dominant role in the formation of dense shelf water, and that this mechanism may not apply in other regions. However, it has been suggested that other processes may drive the pump under different climatic conditions. For instance, in polar regions, the formation of sea-ice results in the extrusion of salt that may increase seawater density. Similarly, in tropical regions, evaporation may increase local salinity and seawater density.	The continental shelf pump is caused my varied oceanic, such as near the poles where the sea-ice formation results in the extrusion of salt that may increase seawater density.	Scientific-428
Researchers in Japan have successfully regrown fully functional teeth in mice. Epithelial and mesenchymal cells were extracted from the mice, cultured to produce a tooth "germ", and the germ was then implanted into the bone at the space of a missing tooth. A tooth of the correct external and internal structure, hardness, strength, and sensitivity later erupted in the space, eventually meeting the opposing tooth in a manner similar to an original natural tooth. This technique may be a possible future treatment for replacement of missing teeth.	The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact among teeth, does not.	Scientific-429
Baby talk and imitations of it may be used by one noninfant to another as a form of verbal abuse, in which the talk is intended to infantilize the victim. This can occur during bullying, when the bully uses baby talk to assert that the victim is weak, cowardly, overemotional, or otherwise submissive.	Baby talk may be used as a form of flirtation between sexual or romantic partners.	Scientific-430
In the field of Energetics, an energy carrier corresponds only to an energy form (not an energy system) of energy input required by the various sectors of society to perform their functions. Energy carriers (EC) are produced by the energy sector using primary energy sources (PES). The distinction between "Energy Carriers" and "Primary Energy Sources" is extremely important since these two labels refer to energy forms of different quality so that they cannot be aggregated: 1 megajoule (MJ) of EC is not the same as 1 MJ of PES.	Beryllium-containing alloys create an inhalation hazard during manufacturing due to their toxic properties.	Scientific-431
Anatomically, the cerebellum has the appearance of a separate structure attached to the bottom of the brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellum is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue (the cerebellar cortex), tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells.	The brainstem provides the main motor and sensory innervation to the face and neck via the cranial nerves.	Scientific-432
If there are any particles suspended in the water, they will increase the scattering of light. In coastal areas, runoff from rivers, resuspension of sand and silt from the bottom by tides, waves and storms and a number of other substances can change the color of the near-shore waters. Some types of particles can also contain substances that absorb certain wavelengths of light, which alters its characteristics.	Particle naturally suspended in water sources can change the color of coastline waters.	Scientific-433
Structured observation represents a compromise between the passive nonintervention of naturalistic observation, and the systematic manipulation of independent variables and precise control characterized by lab experiments. Structured observation may occur in a natural or laboratory setting. Within structured observation, often the observer intervenes in order to cause an event to occur, or to “set up” a situation so that events can be more easily recorded than they would be without intervention. Such a situation often makes use of a confederate who creates a situation for observing behavior. Structured observation is frequently employed by clinical and developmental psychologists, or for studying animals in the wild. One benefit to structured observation is that it allows researchers to record behaviors that may be difficult to observe using naturalistic observation, but that are more natural than the artificial conditions imposed in a lab. However, problems in interpreting structured observations can occur when the same observation procedures are not followed across observations or observers, or when important variables are not controlled across observations.	The word "viscosity" is derived from the Latin "viscum", meaning "anything sticky, birdlime made from mistletoe, mistletoe".	Scientific-434
Cancer cluster suspicions usually arise when members of the general public report that their family members, friends, neighbors, or coworkers have been diagnosed with the same or related cancers. State or local health departments will investigate the possibility of a cancer cluster when a claim is filed. In order to justify investigating such claims, health departments conduct a preliminary review. Data will be collected and verified regarding: the types of cancer reported, numbers of cases, geographic area of the cases, and the patients clinical history. At this point, a committee of medical professionals will examine the data and determine whether or not an investigation (often lengthy and expensive) is justified.	The exact components of FAN will vary from composition of the wort or grape must.	Scientific-435
Ridley examines the history of different attempts which have been made to explain the fact that humans in society do not defect, looking at various computer generated models which have been used to explain how such behaviour could arise. In particular he looks at systems based on the idea of Tit-for-Tat, where members of the group only cooperate with those who also cooperate and exclude those who do not. This allows altruistic behaviour to develop, and causes the optimum solution to the dilemma, to no longer be to defect but instead to cooperate.	Sociobiology investigates social behaviors, such as mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of social insects.	Scientific-436
Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine.	The Internet, and consequently its backbone networks, do not rely on central control or coordinating facilities, nor do they implement any global network policies.	Scientific-437
In humans, mature sexual desire usually begins to appear with the onset of puberty. Sexual expression can take the form of masturbation or sex with a partner. Sexual interests among adolescents, as among adults, can vary greatly. Sexual activity in general is associated with various risks including unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS. The risks are elevated for young adolescents because their brains are not neurally mature; several brain regions in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex and in the hypothalamus important for self-control, delayed gratification, and risk analysis and appreciation are not fully mature.	Self-control is essential in behavior to achieve goals and to avoid impulses and/or emotions that could prove to be negative.	Scientific-438
The God gene hypothesis is based on a combination of behavioral genetic, neurobiological and psychological studies. The major arguments of the hypothesis are: (1) spirituality can be quantified by psychometric measurements; (2) the underlying tendency to spirituality is partially heritable; (3) part of this heritability can be attributed to the gene VMAT2; (4) this gene acts by altering monoamine levels; and (5) spiritual individuals are favored by natural selection because they are provided with an innate sense of optimism, the latter producing positive effects at either a physical or psychological level.	Although it is always difficult to determine the many interacting functions of a gene, VMAT2 appears to be involved in the transport of monoamine neurotransmitters across the synapses of the brain.	Scientific-439
Scientology teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Its method of spiritual rehabilitation is a type of counselling known as auditing, in which practitioners aim to consciously re-experience painful or traumatic events in their past in order to free themselves of their limiting effects. Study materials and auditing courses are made available to members in return for specified donations. Scientology is legally recognized as a tax-exempt organization in the United States and some other countries, and the Church of Scientology emphasizes this as proof that it is a bona fide religion. In other countries, notably France, Germany and the United Kingdom, Scientology does not have comparable religious status.

Vaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease. Sometimes, this is because the host's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all. This may be due to a lowered immunity in general (diabetes, steroid use, HIV infection, age) or because the host's immune system does not have a B cell capable of generating antibodies to that antigen.	Vaccines can be ineffective in case of weak immune system or lack of B cells.	Scientific-441
Osmond iron was made by melting pig iron in a hearth that is narrower and deeper than a typical finery in an English finery forge. The hearth had a charcoal fire blown with bellows through a tuyere. As the iron melted, the drops fell though the blast and congealed. They were then lifted with an iron bar into the blast. As they melted they were caught on the end of a large staff, held in the fire and turned rapidly so that the drops spread out, forming a ball.

There are many different types of personality tests. The most common type is the self-report inventory, also commonly referred to as objective personality tests. Self-report inventory tests involve the administration of many questions/items to test-takers who respond by rating the degree to which each item reflects their behaviour and can be scored objectively. The term 'item' is used because many test questions are not actually questions; they are typically statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (using a Likert scale or, more accurately, a Likert-type scale).	The first personality tests were developed in 1920s and were intended to ease the process of personnel selection, particularly in the armed forces.	Scientific-443
Evolutionary biology, as an academic discipline in its own right, emerged during the period of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s, however, that a significant number of universities had departments that specifically included the term evolutionary biology in their titles, often in conjuction with ecology and behavior.	Charles Darwin was the first to formulate a scientific argument for the theory of evolution by means of natural selection.	Scientific-444
There are several tests for polysemy, but one of them is zeugma: if one word seems to exhibit zeugma when applied in different contexts, it is likely that the contexts bring out different polysemes of the same word. If the two senses of the same word do not seem to fit, yet seem related, then it is likely that they are polysemous. The fact that this test again depends on speakers' judgments about relatedness, however, means that this test for polysemy is not infallible, but is rather merely a helpful conceptual aid.	Testing for polysemy often relies on speakers' relatedness judgments, which also means that certain tests for polysemy -though helpful- can be wrong due to factors such as fluency and background knowledge.

A typical parser generator associates executable code with each of the rules of the grammar that should be executed when these rules are applied by the parser. These pieces of code are sometimes referred to as semantic action routines since they define the semantics of the syntactic structure that is analyzed by the parser. Depending upon the type of parser that should be generated, these routines may construct a parse tree (or abstract syntax tree), or generate executable code directly.	One of the earliest (1964), surprisingly powerful, versions of compiler-compilers is META II, which accepted grammars and code generation rules, and is able to compile itself and other languages.	Scientific-446
CMOS is also sometimes referred to as complementary-symmetry metal–oxide–semiconductor (or COS-MOS). The words "complementary-symmetry" refer to the fact that the typical digital design style with CMOS uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) for logic functions.	Radium, in the form of radium chloride, was discovered by Marie Curie and Pierre Curie in 1898.	Scientific-447
The eutectoid composition of austenite is approximately 0.76% carbon; steel with less carbon content will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallites that do not participate in the eutectoid reaction and cannot transform into pearlite. Likewise steels with higher carbon contents will form cementite before reaching the eutectoid point. The proportion of ferrite and cementite forming above the eutectoid point can be calculated from the iron/iron—carbide equilibrium phase diagram using the lever rule.	Austenite contains less than one percent carbon but steel with less carbon content will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallites that cannot transform into pearlite.

Cabin fever is an idiomatic term, first recorded in 1918, for a claustrophobic reaction that takes place when a person or group is isolated and/or shut in a small space, with nothing to do for an extended period. Cabin fever describes the extreme irritability and restlessness a person may feel in these situations. A person may experience cabin fever in a situation such as being in a simple country vacation cottage. When experiencing cabin fever, a person may tend to sleep, have distrust of anyone they are with, and an urge to go outside even in the rain, snow, dark or hail. The phrase is also used humorously to indicate simple boredom from being home alone.	Claustrophobia is typically classified as an anxiety disorder and often results in panic attack, and can be the result of many situations or stimuli, including elevators crowded to capacity, windowless rooms, and even tight-necked clothing.

Tongoa and Epi islands once formed part of a larger island called Kuwae. Local folklore tells of a cataclysmic eruption that destroyed this island, leaving the two smaller islands and an oval-shaped 12 x 6 km caldera in between (but the story tells of an eruption south of Tongoa). Collapse associated with caldera formation may have been as much as 1,100 metres. Around 32–39 cubic km of magma was erupted, making the Kuwae eruption one of the largest in the last 10,000 years.	Kuwae eruption was massive and caused a caldera of 6 km.	Scientific-450
Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe (see pseudoscience). Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been falsified. There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well understood, basic aspects of biology and physics.

Colliding galaxies are common in galaxy evolution. Due to the extremely tenuous distribution of matter in galaxies, these are not collisions in the normal sense of the word, but rather gravitational interaction. Colliding may lead to merging. This occurs when two galaxies collide and do not have enough momentum to continue traveling after the collision. Instead, they fall back into each other and eventually merge after many passes through each other, forming one galaxy. If one of the colliding galaxies is much larger than the other, it will remain largely intact after the merger; that is, the larger galaxy will look much the same while the smaller galaxy will be stripped apart and become part of the larger galaxy.	After the collision of two galaxies if they do not have enough momentum to continue travelling, a galaxy merging takes place resulting in a single galaxy which usually looks very similar to the larger of the two colliding galaxies if it was significantly bigger in dimension.

Unlike semantics, which examines meaning that is conventional or "coded" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (e.g., grammar, lexicon, etc.) of the speaker and listener, but also on the context of the utterance, any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred intent of the speaker, and other factors. In this respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent ambiguity, since meaning relies on the manner, place, time etc. of an utterance.	In pragmatics, there are two different types of meaning to consider: semantico-referential meaning and indexical meaning.	Scientific-454
A satellite is a subviral agent composed of nucleic acid that depends on the co-infection of a host cell with a helper or master virus for its multiplication. When a satellite encodes the coat protein in which its nucleic acid is encapsidated it is referred to as a satellite virus. A satellite virus of mamavirus that inhibits the replication of its host has been termed a virophage. However, the usage of this term remains controversial due to the lack of fundamental differences between virophages and classical satellite viruses.	A satellite virus in biology is a subviral agent made of nucleic acid which encodes the coat protein in which its nucleic acid is encapsidated.	Scientific-455
Usually the purposes behind watercraft designs and skills are for seafaring education or leisure activities, fishing and resource extraction, transportation of cargo or passengers, and for conducting combat or salvage operations. In general, the purpose of a water vehicle identifies its utility with a maritime industry sub-sector.

Linguistics had made considerable advances in the half-century since Korais' time. The decipherment of ancient writing systems, the publication of Grimm's Law of sound-changes in 1822, Bopp's tracing of the inter-relationships of the Indo-European languages, Diez's work on the development of the Romance languages from Vulgar Latin, Schleicher's demonstration of an evolutionary tree of languages, and finally the announcement of Verner's Law in 1875, had all made it clear that the changes a language undergoes as time passes are not simply accumulations of random damage, like copying errors in a manuscript.	Linguistic developments have shown that languages evolve and grow in common ways, rather than change due to seemingly random errors (such as are found in manuscript copies) as earlier theorists suggested.

Fossil beaches may be discovered where a limestone quarry or strip mining operation is present. For example, Miami has numerous fossil beaches which have been exposed by limestone mining. A famous example is the Pinecrest beds — a fossil-bearing rock formation found in the south of the city which is a segment of a much larger geological formation — the Tamiami Formation.	Fossil beaches are usually found as a result of mining operations such as Miami limestone mining or Pinecrest beds.	Scientific-458
Debris flows have volumetric sediment concentrations exceeding about 40 to 50%, and the remainder of a flow's volume consists of water. By definition, “debris” includes sediment grains with diverse shapes and sizes, commonly ranging from microscopic clay particles to great boulders. Media reports often use the term mudflow to describe debris flows, but true mudflows are composed mostly of grains smaller than sand. On Earth's land surface, mudflows are far less common than debris flows. However, underwater mudflows are prevalent on submarine continental margins, where they may spawn turbidity currents.	Debris flows can be triggered by intense rainfall or snowmelt, by dam-break or glacial outburst floods, or by landsliding that may or may not be associated with intense rain.	Scientific-459
Allergic reactions to fruit and vegetables are usually mild and often just affect the mouth, causing itching, a rash, or blisters where the food touches the lips and mouth. This is called oral allergy syndrome. (A number of people who react in this way to fruit or vegetables will also react to pollen from some trees and weeds. So, for example, people who are allergic to birch pollen are also likely to be allergic to apples.) Another symptom may include slight swelling in the throat, making it feel like it is closing. The ability to breathe is still present though, so it is not fatal.	The oral allergy syndrome, that sometimes causes swelling in the throat, can be triggered by fruits, pollen from trees or weeds.

Generative linguists think that for native speakers of natural languages, grammaticality is a matter of linguistic intuition, a competence learned by language acquisition in childhood. Therefore, generative linguistics strives to predict grammaticality exhaustively. On the other hand, there is a gradual abandonment of grammaticality in favour of acceptability by linguists that stress the social acquisition of language in contrast to innate factors (and who will seldom rely on phrase structure grammar) in the tradition of Hopper 1987.	Prescriptive grammars of controlled natural languages define grammaticality as a matter of explicit consensus.	Scientific-461
A hydrometer is usually made of glass and consists of a cylindrical stem and a bulb weighted with mercury or lead shot to make it float upright. The liquid to be tested is poured into a tall container, often a graduated cylinder, and the hydrometer is gently lowered into the liquid until it floats freely. The point at which the surface of the liquid touches the stem of the hydrometer is noted. Hydrometers usually contain a scale inside the stem, so that the specific gravity can be read directly. A variety of scales exist, and are used depending on the context.	A hydrometer is often made from a glass tube filled with some liquid and a bulb that can be read where it touches the side when free floating in order to measure the specific gravity.	Scientific-462
IQ scores are also used to study IQ distributions in populations and the correlations between IQ and other variables. Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the Flynn effect. Investigation of differing patterns of increases in IQ battery subtest scores informs current research on human intelligence.	Among different studies that have investigated the correlation of IQ scores with other variables, one is the Flynn effect according to which the average IQ of populations grows linearly by time.

By the modern definition, the term binary star is generally restricted to pairs of stars which revolve around a common centre of mass. Binary stars which can be resolved with a telescope or interferometric methods are known as visual binaries.	A binary star, i.e., two stars orbiting the same center, is called a visual binary if it can be resolved with a telescope.	Scientific-464
Human error and performance are two sides of the same coin: "human error" mechanisms are the same as "human performance" mechanisms; performance later categorized as 'error' is done so in hindsight: therefore actions later termed "human error" are actually part of the ordinary spectrum of human behaviour. The study of absent-mindedness in everyday life provides ample documentation and categorization of such aspects of behavior.	A basic example of the hindsight bias is when, after viewing the outcome of a potentially unforeseeable event, a person believes he or she "knew it all along".	Scientific-465
If a sheet of glass is placed in the tank, the depth of water in the tank will be shallower over the glass than elsewhere. The speed of a wave in water depends on the depth, so the ripples slow down as they pass over the glass. This causes the wavelength to decrease. If the junction between the deep and shallow water is at an angle to the wavefront, the waves will refract. In the diagram above, the waves can be seen to bend towards the normal. The normal is shown as a dotted line. The dashed line is the direction that the waves would travel if they had not met the angled piece of glass.	When directly generated and affected by local winds, a wind wave system is called a wind sea and after the wind ceases to blow, wind waves are called swells.	Scientific-466
The Internet backbone refers to the principal data routes between large, strategically interconnected networks and core routers on the Internet. These data routes are hosted by commercial, government, academic and other high-capacity network centers, the Internet exchange points and network access points, that interchange Internet traffic between the countries, continents and across the oceans of the world.	The core of the internet comes from strategically-interconnected routers, known as the Internet backbone, which connect large institutions such as universities or businesses that have high-capacity network centers.

Sleep as a phenomenon appears to have very old evolutionary roots. The nematode C. elegans is the most primitive organism in which sleep-like states have been observed. Here, a lethargus phase occurs in short periods preceding each moult, a fact which may indicate that sleep primitively is connected to developmental processes. Raizen et al.'s results furthermore suggest that sleep is necessary for changes in the neural system.	Studies show that sleeping is an old phenomenon whose roots goes back to nematodes.

The sphenopalatine artery passes through the sphenopalatine foramen into the cavity of the nose, at the back part of the superior meatus. Here it gives off its posterior lateral nasal branches which spread forward over the conchæ and meatuses, anastomose with the ethmoidal arteries and the nasal branches of the descending palatine, and assist in supplying the frontal, maxillary, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal sinuses.

Typical steps involve recording, transcribing (often using the International Phonetic Alphabet and/or a "practical orthography" made up for that language), annotation and analysis, translation into a language of wider communication, archiving and dissemination. Critical to the project of Language Documentation is the creation of good records in the course of doing language description. These materials can be archived, though not all archives are equally adept at handling language materials preserved in varying technological formats, nor are they all equally accessible to potential users.	Language documentation is the process by which a language is documented from a documentary linguistics perspective.	Scientific-470
There are two types of preconditions for unsafe acts: those that relate to the human operator's internal state and those that relate to the human operator's practices or ways of working. Adverse internal states include those related to physiology (e.g., illness) and mental state (e.g., mentally fatigued, distracted). A third aspect of 'internal state' is really a mismatch between the operator's ability and the task demands; for example, the operator may be unable to make visual judgments or react quickly enough to support the task at hand.	Unsafe acts have two preconditions, those that come from an individual's state of mind or physiology, and those that come from their habits, practices and way of working.	Scientific-471
The Townsend discharge is a gas ionization process where free electrons, accelerated by a sufficiently strong electric field, give rise to electrical conduction through a gas by avalanche multiplication caused by the ionization of molecules by ion impact. When the number of free charges drops or the electric field weakens, the phenomenon ceases.	The Townsend discharge is the process of electrical conduction through gas as a result of ionization.

According to the director of the project, the Holometer should be capable of detecting fluctuations in the light of a single attometer, meeting or exceeding the sensitivity required to detect the smallest units in the universe called Planck units. Fermilab states: "Everyone is familiar these days with the blurry and pixelated images, or noisy sound transmission, associated with poor internet bandwidth.	Holometers surpass current measuring devices to record at the scales of the smallest unit, Planck units.	Scientific-473
Arborists who climb (as not all do) can use a variety of techniques to ascend into the tree. The least invasive, and most popular technique used is to ascend on rope. When personal safety is an issue, or the tree is being removed, arborists may use 'spikes', (also known as 'gaffs' or 'spurs') attached to their chainsaw boots with straps to ascend and work. Spikes wound the tree, leaving small holes where each step has been.	Climbing arborists use a variety of techniques, from the least invasive involving ropes, to the most invasive involving chainsaw boots, though the latter injures the tree and is usually only used in cases where the tree is due for removal.

Connectivity based clustering is a whole family of methods that differ by the way distances are computed. Apart from the usual choice of distance functions, the user also needs to decide on the linkage criterion (since a cluster consists of multiple objects, there are multiple candidates to compute the distance to) to use. Popular choices are known as single-linkage clustering (the minimum of object distances), complete linkage clustering (the maximum of object distances) or UPGMA ("Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean", also known as average linkage clustering).	Cluster analysis approaches that are based on distance functions and linkage criterion are called connectivity-based clustering.	Scientific-475
According to the constant velocity hypothesis proposed by Jones and Huang (1982), perception incorporates a prior expectation for constant speed. Therefore, given the temporal intervals marked by sequential stimuli, the brain expects spatial intervals that would yield constant velocity movement (i.e., uniform motion). One limitation of this theory, pointed out by Goldreich (2007), is that it does not explain why even two stimuli pressed in rapid succession against the skin are perceived as closer together the shorter the temporal interval between them is.	The kappa effect appears to depend strongly on phenomenal rather than physical extent because the kappa effect gets bigger as stimuli move faster.	Scientific-476
Today, anthropometry plays an important role in industrial design, clothing design, ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in life styles, nutrition and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e.g. the obesity epidemic), and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections.	Due to changes in life style, activity levels, and large scale changes in body composition, anthropometry still plays a current role in all areas where the dimensions of the human body must be taken into account such as ergonomics or clothing design.

World War II however, perhaps marked the most frantic period of weapons development in the history of humanity. Massive numbers of new designs and concepts were fielded, and all existing technologies were improved between 1939 and 1945. The most powerful weapon invented during this period was the atomic bomb, however many more weapons influenced the world in different ways.	The data that is stored within a cache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original values that are stored elsewhere.	Scientific-478
The spin of the electron and proton can be in either direction - in the classical analogy they are rotating clockwise or anticlockwise around a given axis. They may have their spin oriented in the same direction or in opposite directions. Because of magnetic interactions between the particles, a hydrogen atom that has the spins of the electron and proton aligned in the same direction (parallel) has slightly more energy than one where the spins of the electron and proton are in opposite directions (anti-parallel).	Electrons and protons may spin in either direction (clockwise or anti-clockwise) and because of the magnetic interaction between the two, hydrogen atoms having both spinning in the same direction will have slightly more energy.

Situation sampling involves the study of good people of behavior in many different locations, and under different circumstances and conditions. By sampling different situations, researchers reduce the chance that the results they obtain will be particular to a certain set of circumstances or conditions. For this reason, situation sampling significantly increases the external validity of observational findings. Furthermore, situation sampling significantly increases the generalizability of findings. Compared to when researchers only observe particular types of individuals, researchers using situation sampling can increase the diversity of subjects within their observed sample. Researchers may determine which subjects to observe by either selecting subjects systematically (every 10th student in a cafeteria, for example) or randomly, with the goal of obtaining a representative sample of all subjects.	A chemical system is said to be in equilibrium when the quantities of the chemical entities involved do not and cannot change in time without the application of an external influence.	Scientific-480
The R-value of a material is determined when the material is in a state of saturation such that water will be exuded from the compacted test specimen when a 16.8 kN load (2.07 MPa) is applied. Since it is not always possible to prepare a test specimen that will exude water at the specified load, it is necessary to test a series of specimens prepared at different moisture contents.	The R-Value test measures the response of a compacted sample of soil or aggregate to a vertically applied pressure under specific conditions.	Scientific-481
The uranium isotope 235U is used as the fuel for nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. It is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is fissile, that is, fissionable by thermal neutrons. The isotope 238U is also important because it absorbs neutrons to produce a radioactive isotope that subsequently decays to the isotope 239Pu (plutonium), which also is fissile.	Uranium 235 is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is fissile, and eventually decays to the plutonium 239, which also is fissile.	Scientific-482
Biogeochemistry is the scientific discipline that involves the study of the chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes and reactions that govern the composition of the natural environment (including the biosphere, the cryosphere, the hydrosphere, the pedosphere, the atmosphere, and the lithosphere). In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. The field focuses on chemical cycles which are either driven by or have an impact on biological activity. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus cycles. Biogeochemistry is a systems science closely related to systems ecology.	Biogeochemistry focuses on cycles of chemical elements such as carbon and nitrogen and is related to systems ecology.	Scientific-483
The equivalent term "awakening" has also been used in a Christian context, namely the Great Awakenings, several periods of religious revival in American religious history. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these "Great Awakenings" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.	The geology of the Swabian Jura is mostly limestone, which formed the seabed during the Jurassic period.	Scientific-484
Ecological traps are thought to occur when the attractiveness of a habitat increases disproportionately relative to its value for survival and reproduction. The result is preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitats. For example, Indigo Buntings typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transitions between closed canopy forest and open field. Human activity can create 'sharper', more abrupt forest edges and buntings prefer to nest along these edges. However, these artificial sharp forest edges also concentrate the movement of predators which predate their nests. In this way, Buntings prefer to nest in highly altered habitats where their nest success is lowest.	In addition to removing carbon dioxide, breathing results in loss of water from the body.	Scientific-485
An additional problem with carbon-14 dates from archeological sites is known as the "old wood" problem. It is possible, particularly in dry, desert climates, for organic materials such as from dead trees to remain in their natural state for hundreds of years before people use them as firewood or building materials, after which they become part of the archaeological record. Thus dating that particular tree does not necessarily indicate when the fire burned or the structure was built. For this reason, many archaeologists prefer to use samples from short-lived plants for radiocarbon dating. The development of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating, which allows a date to be obtained from a very small sample, has been very useful in this regard.	Carbon-14 dating is made problematic for trees in dry climates that can exist for centuries before being burned (leading to wrong dates), so many scientists prefer to date using short-lived plants and use mass spectrometry, which can be done on very small samples.

Isostatic depression is the term used by geologists for the sinking of large parts of the Earth's crust into the asthenosphere. The sinking is caused by a heavy weight placed on the Earth's surface. Often this is caused by the heavy weight of glacial ice due to continental glaciation, a process in which permanent ice places pressure on the Earth's crust thereby depressing it with its weight.	Isostatic depression is caused by a heavy weight placed on the Earth's surface, often due to glaciers.	Scientific-487
Shoulders that exhibit stiffness, secondary to capsular tightness, contribute to contracture and hypertrophy of the teres major. Hence, restricted external rotation can encourage adaptive shortening and thickening of the internal rotators of the shoulder principally the teres major and subscapularis. One may speculate that the lateral arm pain presented in shoulder dysfunctions may be of a nerve origin secondary to adverse neural tension of the radial nerve. The triceps brachii has a potential to entrap the radial nerve in the triangular interval secondary to hypertrophy. The presence of a fibrous arch in the long head and lateral head further complicates the situation. Repeated forceful extension seen in weight training and sport involving punching may be a precedent to this scenario. The radial nerve is vulnerable as it passes through this space, for all of the reasons mentioned above.	Light weight training of the teres major can mitigate the entrapment by strengthening the muscles responsible for interior rotation, though any nerve trauma may take several weeks to recover from.

Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other gas giants, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator).	Jupiter, a giant plant with oblate spheroid shape and no solid surface, has a rocky core while being mainly composed of hydrogen and helium.	Scientific-489
Froth flotation is practised by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry. The collectors adsorb onto the surfaces of the particles of select minerals (usually the valuable mineral that is targeted for concentration), making these minerals hydrophobic. Air is passed through the slurry in a tank known as a flotation cell. The air is broken into tiny bubbles by various mechanisms (depending on the design of the flotation cell), and the now-hydrophobic minerals attach to the bubbles, rising with them to the surface of the flotation cell, where they form a froth. The froth flows over the top edge (or "lip") of the flotation cell and forms the flotation concentrate. Ideally, none of the unwanted mineral particles float, and they remain behind as the flotation tailings.	Froth flotation is practised by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry.

Organisms in the intertidal zone are adapted to an environment of harsh extremes. Water is available regularly with the tides but varies from fresh with rain to highly saline and dry salt with drying between tidal inundations. The action of waves can dislodge residents in the littoral zone. With the intertidal zone's high exposure to the sun, the temperature range can be anything from very hot with full sun to near freezing in colder climates.	Since the salt and temperature conditions in intertidal zone can vary considerably, organisms in that zone should be adapted to such variations.	Scientific-491
Long polyyne chains are said to be inherently unstable in bulk because they can cross-link with each other in an exothermal (indeed explosive) reaction. Explosions are a real hazard in this area of research. They can be fairly stable, even against moisture and oxygen, if they are end-capped with suitable groups inert groups (such as tert-butyl or trifluoromethyl) rather than hydrogen atoms, especially bulky ones that can keep the chains apart. In 1995 the preparation of carbyne chains with over 300 carbons was reported using this technique. However the report has been contested by a claim that the detected molecules were fullerene-like structures rather than long polyynes.	Long polyene chains may explode if put together due to cross-linking between the molecules and therefore researchers must take suitable care to prepare the molecules for transport or experiments using neutralizing capping techniques.

In present-day academia, the term "Aryan" has been replaced in most cases by the terms "Indo-Iranian" and "Indo-European", and "Aryan" is now mostly limited to its appearance in the term "Indo-Aryan" for Indic languages and their speakers. Western notions of an "Aryan race" rose to prominence in late-19th and early-20th century racialist thought, an idea most notably embraced by Nazi ideology (see master race).	Improvisation can be thought of as an "on the spot" or "off the cuff" spontaneous moment of sudden inventiveness that can just come to mind, body and spirit as an inspiration and no preparation or training is needed.

A dark galaxy is a hypothetical galaxy composed of dark matter. Dark galaxies receive their name because they have no detectable stars and are theoretically invisible. They are not able to generate stars because their density of gas is too high. Some scientists have theorized that dark galaxies were actually common in the early stages of the universe. Originally, these galaxies had trouble creating stars because of their density, but as time progressed galaxies began to create stars. An influential community of scientists conjecture the existence of dark galaxies to support theories based on other well-studied celestial bodies. There is experimental evidence to support the existence of dark galaxies, although scientists have no conclusive evidence and continue their research.	According to astronomical theories, dark galaxies, i.e., highly dense invisible galaxies composed of dark matter, were common in the early stages of the universe and experimental evidence can now support their existence.

Overmatching is matching for an apparent confounder that actually is a result of the exposure. True confounders are associated with both the exposure and the disease, but if the exposure itself leads to the confounder, or has equal status with it, then stratifying by that confounder will also partly stratify by the exposure, resulting in an obscured relation of the exposure to the disease. Overmatching thus causes statistical bias.	Control of plant diseases is crucial to the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs.	Scientific-495
Morgan was reacting to interpretations of animal behaviour - specifically the anecdotal approach of George Romanes - that he deemed excessively anthropomorphic. The prestige of Lloyd Morgan's canon partly derives from cases he described where behaviour that might at first seem to involve higher mental processes could in fact be explained by simple trial-and-error learning (what we would now call operant conditioning). A famous example is the skilful way in which Morgan's terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily taken by someone seeing the final behaviour as an insightful act; Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it.	The skillfulness of Morgan's studies stems from his careful analysis of how seemingly mentally-complex actions could in reality be explained in terms of operant conditioning, famously illustrated by the case where Morgan's dog was able to open a gate, but which Morgan was able to demonstrate was due to the dog's learning after many case of trial and error.

There are two subcategories: insoluble and soluble fiber. Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans who do not have the required enzymes to disassemble it nor do their digestive systems harbor sufficient quantities of the types of microbes that can do so either. Soluble dietary fiber comprises a variety of oligosaccharides, waxes, esters, resistant starches and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water.	Insoluble and soluble types of fiber mainly contain cellulose abd oligosaccharides respectively.	Scientific-497
A micrometeorite is an extraterrestrial particle, ranging in size from 50 µm to 2 mm, collected on the Earth's surface. Micrometeorites are micrometeoroids which have survived entry through the Earth's atmosphere. They differ from meteorites in being smaller, more plentiful and different in composition and are a subset of cosmic dust, which also includes the smaller interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). Fred Lawrence Whipple first coined the term "micro-meteorite" to describe dust-sized objects that fall to the Earth.	Micrometeoroids of size from 50 µm to 2 mm which can reach the Earth's surface are referred to as micrometeorite, extraterrestrial particles which are smaller.	Scientific-498
Most countries of the world operate fleets of merchant ships. However, due to the high costs of operations, today these fleets are in many cases sailing under the flags of nations that specialize in providing manpower and services at favourable terms. Such flags are known as "flags of convenience". Currently, Liberia and Panama are particularly favoured. Ownership of the vessels can be by any country, however.	During wars, merchant ships may be used as auxiliaries to the navies of their respective countries, and are called upon to deliver military personnel and material.	Scientific-499
Audiograms in humans are produced using an audiometer, which presents different frequencies to the subject, usually over calibrated headphones, at specified levels. The levels are weighted with frequency relative to a standard graph known as the minimum audibility curve, which is intended to represent "normal" hearing. The threshold of hearing is set at around 0 phon on the equal-loudness contours, but is standardised in an ANSI standard to 1 kHz. There are several of the minimal audibility curve, defined in different international standards; different audiometers thus give rise to differences in audiograms. The ASA-1951 standard, for example, used a level of 16.5 dB SPL (sound pressure level) at 1 kHz, whereas the later ANSI-1969/ISO-1963 standard uses 6.5 dB SPL.A 10 dB correction is allowed for older people.	An audiometer produces human audiograms by playing different frequencies to a subject, where frequencies are selected according to the expected "normal" range of human hearing and include many frequencies at the minimal level of audibility.
