Little St-Julien-le-Pauvre, a jewel of early Gothic architecture dating from between 1165 and 1220, hosts recitals of chamber and religious music. With its wafting incense and masses said in Greek or Arabic (the church belongs to the Melchite sect of the Greek Orthodox Church), St-Julien is not out of place in an area packed with Middle Eastern restaurants. Just across rue St-Jacques stands the exquisite 13th- to 15th-century Flamboyant Gothic church of St-Séverin, in which Dante is said to have prayed and Saint-Saëns asked to be made honorary organist.	Bricks fired on the spot are the valley’s main building material.	Travel-1
Next to the castle is the impressive Gothic Sé Velha (Old Cathedral) of Silves, built by the liberating Crusaders, some of whom are buried within, in the 13th century. The remains of a Moorish mosque are hidden behind the altar. Opposite the Sé is the 16th-century Igreja da Misericórdia, with a classic Manueline-style side door.	During the Crusades, Portuguese Crusaders often razed mosques and built churches on top, as is the case for Sé Velha of Silves, which features a Moor mosque hidden behind its altar.	Travel-2
Manzanillo initially drew the interest of international visitors for its excellent fishing. An important annual fishing tournament prompted the construction of modest hotels and condos. In the 1970s, the development, along with the new airport, of the Club Maeva and Las Hadas resorts, with their striking Moorish design, began to bring in a steady flow of tourists. Then the movie Ten, starring Bo Derek and Dudley Moore and filmed in Las Hadas, put Manzanillo squarely in the spotlight.	Nearby, on Calle Pío Rosado, the Museo Emilio Bacardí has wide-ranging art, archaeological, and more recent historical collections (including a small, grotesque collection of mummies).	Travel-3
Alongside a landmark water tower is a good open-air theatre which presents concerts, opera, and ballet performances in the summer. Nearby are the ruins of a 13th-century Dominican Convent that was founded by King Béla IV. Here he enrolled his 11-year-old daughter, Margit, in fulfilment of a vow he had made should he live to survive the Mongol invasion. Princess (and later saint) Margit stayed on the island for the rest of her life; it was subsequently named after her. Her burial place is marked by a marble plaque.	Following a Mongol invasion, King Belá IV made good on his vow to have his daughter Margit join a convent if he survived, on whose island grounds she remained for the rest of her life, ultimately becoming Saint Margit and having the convent's island named after her.	Travel-4
Most beaches protected from the open ocean have rowboats, canoes, or pedalos for rent by the hour. Experienced sailors in search of a more seaworthy craft should ask at the local yacht harbor. In the Algarve, dinghies and sailing instruction are available at Praia de Luz, Quinta do Lago, and Portimão. For bigger craft try the marina at Vilamoura or the Carvoeiro Club. Boat cruises are available in virtually every settlement along the Algarve.	Boat cruises offer a care free way to enjoy the Algarve coasts of Portugal, though rowboats and canoes are available for the adventurous who want to explore the harbor up close.	Travel-5
Shaolin offers one more treat for the more adventurous. It is located at the foot of the western range of the Songshan mountains, part of the mountain cluster that was traditionally regarded as the Central Mountain at the center of the Chinese empire. A gondola now whisks visitors to the top, where hiking trails are abundant and views of the Shaolin complex and the vast desert plains of Henan are impressive. On the far side of the range, sheer walls of stone 300 m (1,000 ft) high tower over the plains, where a series of catwalks and carved footpaths wander through old temples and pavilions into the silence and emptiness beyond.	Visitors may ride a gondola to the mountain top with its extended hiking trails and unparalleled views of the desert and the Shaolin complex.	Travel-6
Lake Voulisméni is connected to the sea by an artificial channel. Across the road bridge at its mouth is the main tourist office, and beyond are the harbor and port. Sea breezes here often make this stroll cooler than around the lake. From the port you can take caïque (small colorful wooden boats) trips to nearby attractions, most notably Spinalónga Island.	A short walk west along the waterfront brings you to the remains of the Dominican Monastery of Áyios Pétros (St. Peter), which is in the process of renovation, and beyond that is the Historical Museum of Crete, housed in a remarkable building — part Venetian mansion and part modern glass edifice.	Travel-7
The Nanjing Museum (Nanjing Bowuguan), founded in 1933, is located inside Zhongshan Gate, the main eastern portal of the city wall. Among art and artifacts from prehistoric times to the end of the empire, the museum displays colorful ancient pottery, elegant figurines, and a famous jade burial suit 2,000 years old. 	Boxwood, mahogany, or bamboo screens, chairs, and chests with elaborately carved designs re-create the atmosphere of old China.	Travel-8
Watch the birdie (and the dolphins). There are several animal/bird parks in the islands, Tenerife’s Loro Park, Gran Canaria’s Palmitos Park, or Lanzarote’s Guinate Tropical Park are all described in the Where To Go section of this guide. Others include the Parque Las Aguilas, Los Cristianos, Arona (Tenerife), which as the name implies, has an eagle show, all kinds of other birds and animals, and the new JungleRaid where kids of all ages can work their way through all kinds of obstacles.	Older children are sure to be fascinated by the Guanche skulls, skeletons, and mummies kept at both the Museo Canario in Las Palmas and the Museo Arqueológico at Santa Cruz on Tenerife.	Travel-9
There are plenty of possibilities for excursions in the vicinity of Guardalavaca. To the west is Bahía de Bariay, which has a monument claiming Columbus’s landing (a fact contested chiefly by Baracoa, farther east). Beyond the bay is Gibara (27 km/17 miles north of Holguín), a captivating if sleepy little port town. You can take a boat trip into the middle of Bahía de Naranjo to a simple aquarium, where you can swim with the dolphins.	 The 750,000-volume collection is amazing, but so too is the interior of the 1849 building, which is exquisitely furnished with antiques, busts of Benjamin Franklin, Daniel Webster, and others, and several paintings by John Singer Sargent and Gilbert Stuart.	Travel-10
The teahouse pond marks one corner of the Old Chinese City (Nanshi), once deemed a danger zone for European visitors. You might still get lost in this maze of backstreets, reminiscent of a North African souk, but much of it has been renovated, tastefully, into the Yuyuan Shopping Center. There are still shops from the old bazaar days selling chopsticks, medicines, bamboo fans, silk, and incense.	The Yuyuan Shopping center, located in the Old Chinese City (Nanshi) is recently renovated much easier for tourists to navigate than if trying to shop in the maze of backstreets in the area.	Travel-11
The apostle Paul arrived in a.d. 59 with his disciple Titus, whom he left behind to convert the islanders to Christianity. Titus had a hard time combating the Cretans’ pagan beliefs, and was martyred for his overzealous efforts. But Christianity eventually triumphed to achieve the strong Orthodoxy of today, and Titus became Crete’s patron saint.	Proudly emblazoned with the Lion of St. Mark, the ports and fortifications of Iráklion (called Candia under Venetian rule, as was the whole of Crete), Chaniá, and Réthymnon bear witness to the Venetians’ ambitious public building program.	Travel-12
The walls look directly onto the Igreja de Santa Maria do Castelo (Church of St. Mary of the Castle), most likely built on the site of the old mosque. The Gothic portal is the only original 13th-century part of the building to have survived the devastating 1755 earthquake. In the chancel is the large tomb of Dom Paio Peres Correia, who drove the Moors out of Tavira in 1242.	Igreja de Santa Maria do Castelo, built over the location of mosque, contains two significant architectural features: a Gothic portal, which is the only original part of the building to survive 1755 earthquake, and a cancel containing the tomb of Dom Paio Peres Correia who liberated Tavira from the Moors in the 13th century.	Travel-13
The political status quo under the United Bermuda Party continued until November 1998, when the PLP (Progressive Labour Party) won an unexpected landslide victory in the general elections. This not only surprised the old school but ushered in a new era full of opportunity for development as the island keeps up with a rapidly changing world. Challenges include environmental and housing issues as well as problems of unemployment, unknown in modern Bermuda until the final years of the 20th century. Positive long-term solutions will ensure that Bermuda continues to enjoy the wealth, security, and comfort it has created for itself.	Bermuda's Progressive Labour party championed many progressive causes, including environmental issues, housing, and unemployment, which helped prepare the island for continued prosperity.	Travel-14
Zihuatanejo was claimed for the Spanish crown by Juan Alvarez Chico in 1522. The town and port saw little action during colonial days and it slumbered quietly, hosting a few lost galleons and pirate ships that happened to stop for repairs or supplies. Local lore tells how one such ship, upon returning from its travels to China, lost hundreds of rolls of silk. The name La Ropa (“the Clothing”) was given to the beach where the silk later washed ashore.	Spain claimed Zihuatanejo in the 16th century but the town was hardly visited during colonial times, except for a few wayward galleons and pirate ships needed repairs, of which one reportedly lost hundreds of silk rolls that later washed up on short, giving the name La Ropa ("the Clothing") to the town's nearby beach.	Travel-15
The Museu Romàntic displays the furniture and accoutrements of a wealthy 18th century, as well as a large family of antique dolls. On the hillsides and lanes are the villas of wealthy Barcelona families, while the streets between the beach and railway station are geared for food and frolic. In late spring, the streets are carpeted with flowers for the procession of Corpus Christi. Sitges is home to one of Spain’s largest gay communities, and is a magnet for gay travelers year-round, but particularly during carnaval. Gay and nudist beaches are just beyond the town beaches. 	 The compound buildings have walls decorated with photographs and paintings of abbots and partisans; one room has a battle-plan relief map of the 1866 incident.	Travel-16
Another restful spot is the River Viewing Pavilion (Wangjianglou), in a park along the south bank of the Jin River. More than 100 kinds of bamboo grow here. As in other traditional Chengdu parks, there are pavilions and towers, rock gardens, ponds, and shady paths. River viewing of a different type is recommended at the site of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, 57 km (35 miles) northwest of Chengdu. This ambitious irrigation and flood-control project, built in the third century b.c., is still in use. The lush hills along the shore provide a poetic setting for an engineering wonder.	The Dujiangyan Irrigation System was built in the third centurcy B.C. to control flooding of the Jin River, which enabled later designers to build such wonders as the River Viewing Pavilion (Wangjianglou) in a scenic park to the southeast in Chengdu.	Travel-17
Although the first mention of the town dates back to 1498, there is really nothing here of historical significance. The town itself, especially Calle San Miguel, is simply a profusion of shops. At the bottom of San Miguel a series of winding stairways, lined by shops of course, lead down towards a 7 km (nearly 5 mile) sweep of golden coastline. This consists of six beaches connected by the wonderful Paseo Maritimo (beach promenade) and broken only by the rocky promontory of Castillo de Santa Clara, which separates the Bajondillo (east) and Carihuela (west) sections of town.	The national park of El Torcal de Antequera is a high limestone plateau that has been eroded by rainwater into a fantasy landscape of fluted pinnacles and towers.	Travel-18
The Costa Blanca’s reputation for magnificent beaches and lively resorts comes from the northern stretch of coast. Take the N-332 from Alicante and drive through Campello to the fishing port of Villajoyosa. This picturesque village, some 30 km (18 miles) from the provincial capital, is more authentically Spanish in character than Benidorm, its cosmopolitan neighbour. 	Due to its core working class, the fishing village of Villajoyosa maintains more of a classic Spanish character.	Travel-19
As an essentially 19th-century phenomenon, Shanghai matured too late to contribute to classical Chinese art or culture. If historic monuments are relatively rare here, it doesn’t mean the city lacks for sights. In Shanghai the interest shifts to relics of uninhibited prewar capitalism and scenes of the city’s contemporary energy and flair.	Chinese performances combine amusement with edification in a glittering package few Western impresarios could afford to mount.	Travel-20
Perched on the edge of the Bairro Alto is one of Lisbon’s most evocative sights, the shell of the 14th-century Igreja do Carmo, which was packed with worshippers on All Saints’ Day, 1755, when the terrible earthquake brought the roof down. The church remains deliberately preserved as an atmospheric ruin. Nearby, the sumptuous 16th-century Igreja de São Roque features a lavish baroque chapel of São João Baptista (St. John the Baptist) and a small museum of sacred art.	 However, you don’t have to go in search of snow to ski; the Glacier ski center in Pankow has the longest indoor ski course in the world.	Travel-21
Eco- and adventure-tourism fans will feel they’ve reached nirvana here. With an increasing number of tourists looking for these options, the Mexican Association of Adventure Travel and Eco-tourism (AMTAVE; Tel. (5) 663-5381, or www.amtave.com.mx) was formed to offer information about the most qualified guides and authentic service providers in each area of Mexico, and can direct you to qualified members in the area.	One of the town’s main attractions is the natural phenomenon of the Bay of Fundy’s extraordinary tides, with a variation from low to high tide of 8.	Travel-22
Sailing: Weekend and summer sailing is very popular with Athenians as the crowded marinas such as those at Pireaus testify. Tournaments occur regularly throughout the summer, and even the children have their own league competitions. Several companies have boats to rent — with crew or “bare” if you have a skipper’s certificate. Contact the Hellenic Sailing Federation, Odos Xenofondos 15, Tel. 01-3235560 for more details.	Athens features a very active sailing community, especially in the summer which features tournaments both for adults and children.	Travel-23
To the west of the Acropolis stands another small range of hills now cut by footpaths and covered in trees offering cooling shade in the heat of summer. This area, reached by crossing Odós Rovertou Gali and walking up behind the Dionysus restaurant, offers splendid views across to the Acropolis (it’s the best place for afternoon overviews), and the Sound and Light Show auditorium is located here for this reason. Several archaeological sites can be seen and the area is much less crowded than the Acropolis itself. You’ll also see the 16th century church, Ayios Dimítrios Loumbardhi, nestling under the woodland canopy.	Following this, new defensive walls were constructed that included elements of the ruined old Temple of Athena and the old Parthenon.	Travel-24
As a delightful alternative to driving, you can travel from Vancouver to Squamish aboard the Royal Hudson 2860 steam train, a regular old puffer giving you a close-up view of mountain and forest. The round trip takes 6 hours, including a 2-hour stopover in Squamish allowing for a walk over to Shannon Falls. You also have the option of making one leg of the trip by sea (30 minutes longer). Board the morning train in North Vancouver at the bottom of Pember Street and return from Squamish on the MV Britannia ferry — or vice versa, starting from Vancouver’s Harbor Ferry dock at the bottom of Denman Street.	Common scenic options from Squamish to Vancouver are the Royal Hudson 2860 steam train that provides a great view of the famed Pacific Northwest landscape along with a stop to see Shannon Falls or traveling by sea on the MV Britannia ferry.	Travel-25
At the beginning of the 19th century, Napoleon managed to drag Portugal into the heat of Europe’s conflicts. France invaded in 1807 when Portugal refused to close its ports to British shipping. The royal family fled to Brazil aboard a British ship and the British general, Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington), countered the invasions. The final battle came in 1810–1811, when the French, unable to pass the huge fortifications at Torres Vedras, retreated back to Spain.	 Two of the more popular of Budapest’s first division football teams are currently Kispest-Honvéd and Ferencváros.	Travel-26
Wood carvings are made from a variety of native trees. Some of the best are made from the lignum vitae, the Bahamian national tree, and from the wild tamarind. The carvings come in a bewildering variety, though animal and fish motifs seem to predominate. Always check a piece thoroughly before you buy as they are vary in quality. Don’t buy wood if it looks green — this usually means the wood has not been allowed to season, and it may split as it dries.	The wild tamarind, the Bahamian national tree, is popular with local artisans for carving a variety of trinkets available for purchase.	Travel-27
The Chinese arrived in the wake of the great Taiping Rebellion of 1851, seeking security and prosperity in what they were told were California’s “Golden Mountains.” They suffered both exploitation by Chinese entrepreneurs, who used them as indentured labor, and discriminatory taxation by the state legislature. The worst-treated, however, were the Native Americans, whose numbers dwindled rapidly not only as a result of disease and malnutrition but also because of systematic massacres in the 1850s by Californian militia.	You can get to almost all these places by train or bus, and air travel is quite cheap.	Travel-28
Fishing: You don’t need to be a professional angler to enjoy a relaxing day’s fishing. Just about every male over the age of five can be found sitting on the sea wall waiting for a bite and it is amazingly relaxing to be letting the rod do all the work. Or you can rent a small boat and head out into deeper water. Contact the Amateur Anglers and Maritime Sports Club at Moutsopoulou Quay, Tel. 01-4515731 for more details.	Fishing is a popular and relaxing pastime enjoyed by the locals who sit out on the sea wall angling for a bite.	Travel-29
On the site of the Gothic complex of the Hospital de la Santa Creu (Hospital of the Holy Cross), a hospital and refuge for pilgrims stood for a thousand years. Gaudí died here in 1926. The present structures were begun in 1401. Look for the frieze of 16th-century tiles on the life of St. Paul in the entryway of the Institut d’Estudis Catalans. The hospital’s courtyard is restful, with benches near orange trees ripe with fruit in summer. Exhibitions of art and books are held in the various halls off the cloister.	Though over a millenium old, the current hospital structure was started in 1401 and contains wonderful elements like a frieze of St. Paul's life from 16th century and a quaint courtyard with inviting benches and fresh orange blossoms in the summer.	Travel-30
Waterwheels have been operating in the Murcia region for over a thousand years. You can see one at La Ñora, 6 km (31⁄2 miles) from the Murcia city centre. The original wheel has been replaced with a steel one, but the Moorish system is otherwise unchanged. A few kilometres (a couple of miles) farther, in the direction of Granada on the N-340, the Museo de la Huerta (Agriculture Museum) at Alcantarilla adjoins a second waterwheel, also of steel. Museum exhibits present all aspects of Murcian country life, including traditional furnishings.	Waterwheels have been in use in the Murcia region for over a millenia and though the original wooden wheels have been replaced with a steel wheels (as at La Ñora and the Museo de la Huerta), the Moorish waterwheel system remains largely the same.	Travel-31
Since the time of the First Opium War (1839–1842), Western nations had been pushing China to open its doors to foreign trade. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, British and French troops forcibly occupied Beijing and exacted treaty rights. Foreign delegations, businesses, and missionaries poured into the capital, taking up residence in the Legation Quarter, located just southeast of the Forbidden City.	After years of pressure to allow foreign trade, the French succeed in acquiring treaty rights from Beijing after the Second Opium War, releasing an outpouring of delegates, missionaries, and business into the city.	Travel-32
This is an ideal island to put on your walking boots and take to the countryside. You will be well-rewarded, with small remote villages, hidden churches, and a rural lifestyle to explore. Though Cretans are bemused as to why anyone would want to hike without any purpose but the pleasure of it, they have a genuine welcome for travelers on foot. Itineraries can range from easy flat short walks to steep mountain hikes, though it’s not advisable to head into the high peaks without a guide.	Hikes in Crete are filled with much to see amongst the hidden villages, churches, and idyllic scenery - not to mention the friendly interactions with the locals you will meet on the way.	Travel-33
Tourists can choose between ordinary Chinese passenger ships or more deluxe luxury cruise ships that cater to overseas visitors. The river boats that the Chinese use lack frills, amenities, and guides. The luxury craft charge much more but offer a good range of tourist services, including decent meals. Often reserved in part for package tours, these ships are also open to independent travelers, and staterooms can even be booked in advance overseas with such lines as Victoria Cruises.	 Once there, you should be able to count off all the other Canary Islands and, on a good day, see North Africa.	Travel-34
This stark mountain landscape of pine forest progressively thinning out to more arid, craggy canyons above the fast-flowing river is the pioneer country that “made” British Columbia. Driving east from Vancouver on the Trans-Canada Highway and following the Fraser River north to its tributary, the Thompson, you are backtracking along the great exploration route traced by intrepid fur traders from the prairies to the Pacific. It’s also the route unerringly followed by millions of Pacific salmon between the ocean and their spawning grounds far inland. And, against all the odds of the terrain, it’s the route the railways chose to carry the riches of lumber, mining — and the first tourists — across the continent.	Driving eastward from Vancouver through the stark mountain landscape that defines British Columbia, you retrace the not only the steps of the original fur traders on their way to the pacific, but also Pacific salmon on their migratory journeys and the railroad itself.	Travel-35
Just around the corner and up a curving alleyway of vendors, the Great Mosque (Qingzhensi) traces its history to a.d. 742. The serene and spacious complex consists of gardens, temples, and pavilions, largely in the Chinese style. The side galleries contain beautifully carved furniture and screens. The triple-eaved Introspection Tower (Shengxin) is a minaret from which many of Xi’an’s sizeable Muslim minority, including descendants of Silk Road travelers, are called to prayer. The prayer hall holds over 1,000.	Xi'an contains a sizable Muslim community originating from exchange along the Silk Road, with its most famous mosque, Qingzhensi, containing sizable grounds with Chinese-influenced temples and gardens, among its room for over a thousand in its main prayer hall.	Travel-36
Candlesticks, pots and pans, old-fashioned scales, bowls, and trays can be found across Portugal. Cataplanas make a delightful decorative or functional souvenir. The Moorish tradition of producing cooking utensils from beaten metal is maintained in the town of Loulé, in the Algarve. 	Portugal is a treasure trove for artisanal-yet-functional souvenir's like bows, trays, and candlesticks, which are often made in the old Moorish traditions.	Travel-37
Sukarno’s association with the PKI led to his being forced to yield most of his powers. Only his honored role in the independence struggle saved him from trial. In 1968 Suharto took over the presidency. 	Suharto took over Bali's presidency in 1968 after Sukarno was forced to abdicate due to his ties with the PKI.	Travel-38
The neighboring suburb of San Marino was once owned by railroad tycoon Henry E. Huntington (1850–1927), and his fine mansion now houses the Huntington Library (1151 Oxford Road). Its collection of rare books includes one of the First Folios of Shakespeare, a Gutenberg Bible, and a first edition of Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography. The most seductive attraction is perhaps the 130-acre (50-hectare) Botanical Garden, with its magnificent Rose, Desert, and Japanese gardens.	San Marino contains two main attractions: the Huntington Library with its large collection of books and the Botanical Gardens, which range over a hundred acres -a rarity in the Los Angeles area- and contains several gardens dedicated to specific styles.	Travel-39
From the Golden Temple, continue descending the narrow lane and you will come to temple complex dominated by a five-tiered pagoda, the Kumbheshwar Temple, which is dedicated to Shiva and dates to 1392. Two ponds in the temple compound are said to be fed by waters from the holy Gosainkund Lake high in the Himalayas. During summer, thousands of devotees come to bathe in these ponds beneath a richly ornamented Shiva lingam.	In summer months, Shiva devotees come to the ponds at the Kumbheshwar Temple to bath.	Travel-40
The museum looks out on East Lake (Dong Hu), vaunted as the largest lake in any municipal park in China, with 33 sq km (nearly 13 sq miles) of invitingly clear water. Boating, swimming, and fishing are popular here. Of course, no Chinese lake would be complete without its artificial islands, causeways, and pavilions, several of which serve as teahouses festooned with peach and plum blossoms, orchids or osmanthus, depending on the season.	Common sights in Chinese lakes include artificial islands, causeways, and pavilions, which may also serve as teahouses festooned with flowers, depending on the season.	Travel-41
Southwest of the Invalides is the Ecole Militaire, where officers have trained since the middle of the 18th century. Their former parade ground, the vast Champ de Mars, is now a green park stretching all the way to the Tour Eiffel. Horse races were held here in the 1780s, and also five World Fairs between 1867 and 1937. In the 20th century, it has become the front lawn of the Left Bank’s most luxurious residences. It’s also popular with American expatriates, who often can be seen playing touch football or softball games.	The vast park Champ de Mars stretches to the Tour Eiffel, big enough for hosting five World Fairs and even horse races, and inviting enough for expatriates to take up popular foreign sports like softball or football on its lawns.	Travel-42
Near the town of Lisse are the celebrated Keukenhof Gardens, a 28-hectare (69-acre) showpiece flower garden which opens its doors to the public. You’ll find crocus, hyacinth, and narcissus blooms along with the tulip, in colors you normally only see in your imagination. The landscape at Keukenhof is enhanced by pretty windmills, adding to the authentic Dutch feel. There is also a restaurant and a gift shop where you can buy bulbs, blooms, and other Dutch souvenirs.	It also has some of the oldest waterways, once so important for the delivery of goods from around the Dutch colonial world.	Travel-43
Two of Beijing’s top attractions, the Summer Palace and the Western Hills, are located northwest of the capital’s relentless urban sprawl. This is the beautiful, hilly countryside of the Haidian District (home to China’s top universities and computer technology developers). And closer to city center, the western precincts of Beijing are the site of four major temples, the Beijing Art Museum, and the Beijing Zoo.	Near the northern gate to the Forbidden City is the Imperial Garden (Yu Hua Yuan), filled with small pavilions, ancient cypress trees, and complex rookeries, all built during the Ming Dynasty.	Travel-44
German Qingdao suffered a curious fate during World War I. Japan, which joined the Allied forces, invaded the city, imprisoned the survivors of the German garrison, and occupied Qingdao for the duration of the war. China wasn’t able to regain sovereignty until 1922. After the Communists came to power in 1949, industrial development went forward. However, even though the population now exceeds 4 million (including the outlying regions), Qingdao keeps its quiet allure.	Japan invaded Qingdao during WWI for the duration of the war, only returning the region to China in 1922.	Travel-45
In Lombok, ritual fights long ago took the place of war. The Balinese and Sasaks hurl packets of cooked rice at each other in the October perang ketupet festival. Large crowds gather regularly in villages in Lombok to watch peresehan contests in which men armed with rattan canes and leather shields lash at each other until the referee declares one of them the victor.	 There are more fine beaches towards the southern tip of the island, but you will need a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get there.	Travel-46
South of Hollywood Boulevard is L.A.’s most famous street, Sunset Boulevard. The section between Hollywood and Beverly Hills, known simply as “The Strip,” continues to be the playground of the rich, famous, young, and hip. A drive down Sunset can be dangerous, as the billboards touting the latest movies and records may make it difficult to keep your eyes on the road.	LA's most famed street, Sunset Blvd., is filled with activities and people, though be aware that if driving, the boulevard is also filled with enticing animated billboards known to distract tourist drivers!	Travel-47
National unity and strength were renewed under the Sui Dynasty (a.d. 581–618), a brief prelude to the highest achievements of Chinese art. The Sui built a stately new metropolis at Chang’an, near the site of the old Han capital (present-day Xi’an, in Shaanxi Province). They also began work on the Grand Canal, which was to link the rice-growing areas of the Yangzi valley with Beijing, an engineering achievement comparable to the construction of the Great Wall.	The Sui Dynasty significantly improved national unity, building a new city at Chang'an and starting the work on the Grand Canal that connected Beijing with the rice fields in the Yangzi.	Travel-48
Diexodos is a company that organizes guided hiking tours either by the day or longer. They can supply equipment and extra insurance if you need it. Contact them at Tel./fax (0841) 28098.	The Diexodos company organizes guided hikes for one or more days and can even supply your equipment and insurance if you need them.	Travel-49
Except for quotations on the walls from the New Testament and Christian Science founder, Mary Baker Eddy, there’s no decoration. Some stained glass windows are found in the older church, which also contains founder Mary Baker Eddy’s chair. She only addressed the congregation twice, as she wished to avoid any personal idolatry. A guided tour is highly recommended (you can only visit the original church by joining a tour).	The church is only visitable by guided tour and is itself sparsely decorated with a few New Testament verses on the wall and stained glass windows in the older church.	Travel-50
Towards the northeast of the Beira Alta is the barren plateau of the Planalto (“High Plain”), a wild, cold, and sparsely populated region, but important enough to have been fought over by Portugal and Spain. The plateau’s isolation attracted many Jews fleeing the Inquisition. The atmospheric walled town of Trancoso (43 km/26 miles to the north of Guarda) records this heritage in the stone carvings above the doorways of Jewish houses. From miles around, you can see the powerful castle walls and strong keep built by Dom Dinis to fortify the border against Spain.	 An unexpected bargain is cashmere sweaters, in all styles and colors.	Travel-51
Of all the springs in Jinan, the one with the most historical associations is the Jet Spring (Baotuquan). It was from this spring in the 17th century that the Qing Dynasty Emperor Kangxi took a swig and pronounced it the “First Spring Under Heaven.” It is now surrounded by a carefully landscaped park. A short walk away is Black Tiger Spring (Heihuquan), its sweet water roaring from the mouths of three tigers carved in a black stone cliffside.	The park containing Baotuquan (Jet Spring) dates back to the 17th century when Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty tasted the spring's water and declared it to be the "First Spring Under Heaven."	Travel-52
Champlain’s Abitation of 1608 — two wooden houses and a storehouse for furs surrounded by a stockade and a ditch — stood on the Place Royale, now a beautifully restored square of elegant 17th- and 18th-century houses. In the center is a replica of a 1686 bust of Louis XIV. Facing the Place Royale, the church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires celebrates French victories over the British before 1759.	The two houses and storehouse were the original habitation of Champlain upon which now stands the restored central square with 18th and 17th century houses, the church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, and in the center a bust of Louis XIV.	Travel-53
The National Museum of Science and Technology (1867 St. Laurent Boulevard) is in the style of science through fun and games. In Canada’s largest museum, there are views of the heavens through a huge refracting telescope, do-it-yourself demonstrations of balance and optics, and a plastic bubble with live chicks hatching in front of your eyes. But with all the new-fangled razzmatazz, the museum hasn’t forgotten the charm of mint-condition antique cars and, above all, old train engines — behemoths from the great era of steam that truly “made” Canada.	Providing a cultural counterpoint a block north of the Convention Center, Vancouver architect Arthur Erickson’s transparent Roy Thomson Hall glows at night to show off the throngs of smart concert-goers attending the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

With his ambition of uniting the states of Brandenburg and Prussia, it was the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm (1640–1688) who prepared Berlin to become a strong capital, and fortified it as a garrison town. The first newcomers were 50 wealthy Jewish families who had been expelled from Vienna in 1671. Then 14 years later 5,600 Huguenot Protestants arrived after being driven out of France by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. At a time when France was considered the cultural master of Europe, these sophisticated merchants and highly skilled craftsmen — among them jewelers, tailors, chefs, and restaurant-owners — brought a new refinement to the town.	Friedrich Wilhelm was instrumental in the development of Berlin, shepherding in 50 affluent Jewish families initially, and later, thousands of Huguenot Protestants fleeing France, who together greatly increased the towns upper class with more refined crafts such as culinary arts, tailoring, and jewelry making.

From behind the Ajuntament, take the short carrer d’Hèrcules to the Plaça de Sant Just for a quick peek at the church of Sants Just i Pastor and the small, charming, quiet square it sits on, evocative of a bygone Barcelona. The church is one of the oldest in the city, though often remodeled. It is said that any will to which one swears before the church’s altar is recognized as valid by the courts of Barcelona, a practice that dates to the tenth century.	Set back from the street is one of La Rambla’s great attractions and a constant in the life of Barcelonans: the Mercat de Sant Josep, also called La Boquería.	Travel-56
Tomar’s pleasant central square, Praça da Republica, is flanked by the elegant Manueline church of São João Baptista, with an unusual octagonal belfry and intricate portico, and the 17th-century town hall. The statue in the center of the plaza tells the real story of the town, though. Beneath a colony of ever-present pigeons, it depicts Gualdim Pais, Grand Master of the Portuguese branch of the crusading Order of the Knights Templar, to whom the town was granted in 1157.	 From Kathmandu, take a car or bus up the Trisuli River valley (an adventure in itself) to Dhunche, the entrance to Langtang National Park (there is a small fee to enter, so keep the ticket: it may be requested en route).

Poland’s war-torn and almost incomprehensibly fractured history plays out like an epic novel — occasionally triumphant, frequently sad and tragic. Over a millennium, Poland evolved from a huge and imposing, economically powerful kingdom to a partitioned nation that ceased to exist on world maps for over 120 years, and finally to a people and land at the center of the 20th century’s greatest wars and most horrific human tragedies. But Poland has survived, with its culture, language and most of its territory intact, and today Poles look forward with optimism to taking their place at the forefront of the new, post-Communist Central Europe.	Polands emerging economy today masks the ups and downs of its history, including being wiped off the map for over a century but also being one of the most powerful European kingdoms at one point.

At the summit is one of the oldest stupas in the world, an immense white mound surmounted by a golden cube, on the four sides of which are the astonishing all-seeing eyes of Buddha. Above this rises a tower of 13 diminishing golden disks symbolizing the 13 steps to enlightenment, then a golden royal parasol topped by a bell-shaped crown. Strings of prayer flags stretch from the tower’s pinnacle, and around the base are hundreds of small prayer wheels. While pilgrims circumambulate the stupa, monkeys, dogs, and pigeons clamber about and forage for scraps of food offerings in small altars set in the foundation.	Freak Street is no longer Kathmandu’s hub for the backpacking crowd; today’s budget travelers seem to be willing to spend a bit more than their hippie predecessors did.	Travel-59
As the Roman empire began to crumble, however, Huns and Vandals swarmed over the river, and during the early fifth century Aquincum fell to the tribes of Attila. It is believed that the town on the west side of the river was named after Attila’s brother (or possibly his brother-in-law), Buda, who was banished there. When Attila died in 453 the Huns were overthrown and the Avars became the dominant power, occupying the region from the middle of the sixth century to the early ninth century.	The Huns and Vandals ruled the river after the Romans, even naming a city after Attila's brother, until the rise of Avars after Attila died.	Travel-60
In 1897, in an attempt to curb the worst excesses of the Big Easy, Alderman Sidney Story created a city ordinance outlawing prostitution everywhere in the city except for a small, specific area just beyond the French Quarter, where it could be contained and controlled. This area, known as Storyville, became a legend in its own time, where the mixture of glamour, depravity, and color in the local brothels attracted almost every visiting celebrity, and where saloon drinkers, gamblers, and rakes waiting their turn could tap their feet to a developing style of music — jazz. Louis Armstrong started playing his bent, nickel-plated cornet in the dives of Storyville. He improvised from evening to daybreak for 15 cents a night.	Located in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Storyville attracted almost every visiting celebrity and was one of the birthplaces of jazz, where Louis Armstrong first got his start and developed his bent-horn trumpet playing.

The mountains you see off in the distance on Benidorm’s horizon are fragrant with wild herbs and lavender, and in July and August the hedges are lush with blackberries that few local people bother to pick. Drive south on the motorway to Villajoyosa, then take the road that leads to Sella. The countryside is undistinguished, until suddenly you look down on the emerald-green waters of the Amadorio Dam, a favourite haunt of fishermen and discerning picnickers. Within another 5 km (3 miles) you arrive at Sella village, dwarfed beneath an extraordinary plateau.	Passing in the distance on your way to Benidorm, lush mountains with many herbs and -in summer- blackberries, your drive continues through the countryside to Villajoyosa and Sella until you reach Amadorio Dam, which features fantastic picnicking and fishing with a fabulous view of the plateau.

After exploring the fort, walk back across the grassy lawns. (At the small traffic circle at the end of the driveway you’ll find refreshment stalls where you can get a cool drink or snack before moving on.) Young Puertorriqueños have taken to skateboarding and rollerblading on nearby Plaza del Quartel Ballajá. They gather every day at this square to compete with their peers and show off their skills to passersby.

The grey-green Danube cuts straight through the heart of the city — neatly separating the ancient cobblestone streets of Buda from the late-19th-century boulevards of Pest. If you love history you’ll probably head for the Buda side of the river, but if you’re a keen shopper and enjoy lively nightlife, then Pest will certainly oblige. 	Budapest was originally two cities, Buda and Pest, which still retain distinct characteristic in their modern incarnations, having historical flair or a livelier shopping, respectively.	Travel-64
The 90-minute drive from Toronto to Niagara Falls (130 km/81 miles south of Toronto) curves around the west end of Lake Ontario through the province’s industrial heartland — Mississauga, Hamilton, and St. Catharines, known as the Golden Horseshoe. If you want to see the Falls without getting entangled overnight in the mob scene of the tourists (12 million visitors annually), stay over in the quieter town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, a mere half-hour drive away.	You might very easily walk right past the unprepossessing façade of the Metro Toronto Library (on Yonge one block north of Bloor), but the subtly interconnected areas of architect Raymond Moriyama’s striking interior may tempt you to give up your vacation and get down to some solid study.

The café life in Dali is one of its chief delights. Cafés are perfect spots to wile away the sunny hours over coffee or beer or to meet local Bai people as well as other travelers.

The museum documents the achievements of the most progressive 20th-century European school of architecture and design. Architects Walter Gropius, Mies Van der Rohe, and Marcel Breuer, along with artists Paul Klee, Vasili Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, Oskar Schlemmer, and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy attempted to integrate arts, crafts, and architecture into mass industrial society. On view here is a selection of the objects they created: tubular steel chairs, cups and saucers, teapots, desks, new weaves for carpets, chess pieces, and children’s building blocks, as well as some pioneering architectural plans and sketches.

There’s the sparkling Atlantic coastline, with its delightful little fishing ports. Or rolling green hills across the interior to the orchards and dairy farms of Annapolis Valley. This western side of the peninsula is rich in the poignant history of French Acadia. The province’s northern island is the site of one of Canada’s best-loved national parks, Cape Breton Highlands, where you’ll drive the spectacular Cabot Trail along the coast and in and out of the forest.

Return to the city center on Point Grey Road and stop off near Jericho Beach to visit the Old Hastings Mill Store (1575 Alma Road). Carried here lock, stock, and barrel from downtown in the 1930s, this is the town’s oldest surviving building — a post office, general store, and the only remnant from the original Gastown to have escaped the 1886 fire. It has been restored as a museum for turn-of-the-century paraphernalia. Closest that wholesome Vancouvrites get to being Bohemian, the Kitsilano neighborhood here is popular with students, young and old.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe’s southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians.

The last town on the north shore, Keszthely (pronounced kest-hey), was once owned entirely by the wealthy Festetics family, and their palace is one of Hungary’s most important Baroque monuments (open all year round). Here, among a selection of its 101 rooms, you can see something of the aristocratic life the family enjoyed during the 18th and 19th centuries. The highlight is the Helikon library, claimed to be the greatest in the country, and it alone is worth the palace entrance charge (which is hefty by Hungarian standards).	The Helikon library, once owned by the Festetics family, is considered by some to be the best in Hungary and easily accessible on the tour of the original family's palace.	Travel-72
A Liberation Monument (Szabadsag szobor), visible from all parts of the city, stands below the citadel. It was erected by the Russians in honour of their troops who fell while “liberating” Budapest from the Germans. The monument is loathed by most locals as a symbol of Soviet domination, but it has become too much of a city landmark to remove.	A highly-visible landmark from everywhere in the city, the Liberation Monument was originally installed by Russians to honor their fallen when "freeing" Budapest from Germany, but is now disdained by many residents for this connection - though its landmark status largely prevents its removal.

One of the most picturesque towns in the province is the lovely village Alte, about 30 km (18 miles) north of Albufeira. The architectural highlight of the village is the beautiful 16th-century Igreja Matriz, entered through a classic Manueline portal. The rest of Alte is the Algarve of picture postcards — white-washed houses along narrow streets, colorful windows, filigreed chimney pots, and red-tiled roofs. 	The west wall was restored in the early 20th century after it fell down in 1852.	Travel-74
Batur was rebuilt in its present position on the crater rim after a 1926 eruption buried the old site down below.

Kintamani, adjoining Batur, is brightened up only by its market, on Monday and Thursday mornings.	Batur was devastated by the nearby volcanic eruption in 1926, which buried part of the town completely, forcing its residents to rebuild on top of the remains.	Travel-75
All was not totally lost, however. In 1867, under a compromise designed to curtail home-rule agitation, the Austro-Hungarian empire was established and Hungary was finally granted its own government, though key ministries were shared with the Austrians. This “Dual Monarchy” saw out the 19th century on a bright note, with splendid boulevards and proud buildings erected to create the Pest we recognize today. The Chain Bridge became the first permanent link across the river, the Pest metro and the Pest-Vienna railway opened, and, in 1873, the towns of Pest, Buda, and Obuda merged to become Budapest.	The development of the splendid, historical Pest part of Budapest owes much to the Dual Monarchy government created during the Austro-Hungarian empire.	Travel-76

The lack of snow delayed the opening of a number of ski resorts in the area, with only six open by November 16. Copper Mountain required use of snow machines to keep snow on their ski runs.

The Frogs, grieved at having no established Ruler, sent ambassadors to Jupiter entreating for a King.  Perceiving their simplicity, he cast down a huge log into the lake.  The Frogs were terrified at the splash occasioned by its fall and hid themselves in the depths of the pool.  But as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam again to the top of the water, dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting on it in contempt.  After some time they began to think themselves ill-treated in the appointment of so inert a Ruler, and sent a second deputation to Jupiter to pray that he would set over them another sovereign.  He then gave them an Eel to govern them.  When the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time to Jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another King.  Jupiter, displeased with all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed upon the Frogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon the lake.	Be careful what you ask for.	Metaphoric-358
An ant went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of drowning.  A Dove sitting on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close to her.  The Ant climbed onto it and floated in safety to the bank.  Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches.  The Ant, perceiving his design, stung him in the foot.  In pain the birdcatcher threw down the twigs, and the noise made the Dove take wing.	Pay kindness forward, as it may return to you in a time of need.	Metaphoric-359
 A Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an armourer's shop.  As he glided over the floor he felt his skin pricked by a file lying there.

A Jay venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there a number of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when they were moulting.  He tied them all to his tail and strutted down towards the Peacocks.  When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, and striding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes.  So the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who had watched his behaviour from a distance; but they were equally annoyed with him, and told him: "It is not only fine feathers that make fine birds."

A Shepherd-boy, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, "Wolf! Wolf!"  and when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains.  The Wolf, however, did truly come at last.  The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror:  "Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance.  The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.  	Early shepherds used vocal calls to alert those nearby to the presence of predators.	Metaphoric-362
A Lion and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought fiercely for its possession.  When they had fearfully lacerated each other and were faint from the long combat, they lay down exhausted with fatigue.  A Fox, who had gone round them at a distance several times, saw them both stretched on the ground with the Kid lying untouched in the middle.  He ran in between them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could.  The Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said, "Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored ourselves only to serve the turn of a Fox."  	Lions and bears compete for the same food sources.	Metaphoric-363
A bear came across a log where a swarm of bees had nested to make their honey. As he snooped around, a single little bee flew out of the log to protect the swarm. Knowing that the bear would eat all the honey, the little bee stung him sharply on the nose and flew back into the log. This flew the bear into an angry rage. He swatted at the log with his big claws, determined to destroy the nest of bees inside.This only alerted the bees and quick as a wink, the entire swarm of bees flew out of the log and began to sting the bear from head to heel. The bear saved himself by running to and diving into the nearest pond.	The Wolf complied, and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the Wolf.	Metaphoric-364
A Kid was perched up on the top of a house, and looking down saw a Wolf passing under him.  Immediately he began to revile and attack his enemy.

A boy put his hand into a pitcher full of filberts.  He grasped as many as he could possibly hold, but when he tried to pull out his hand, he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the pitcher.  Unwilling to lose his filberts, and yet unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his disappointment.  A bystander said to him, "Be satisfied with half the quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand." 	Greed may cause you to lose everything, but with moderation you can obtain at least something.	Metaphoric-366
A boy was stung by a Nettle.  He ran home and told his Mother, saying, "Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently."  "That was just why it stung you," said his Mother.

Patty the Milkmaid was going to market carrying her milk in a Pail on her head.  As she went along she began calculating what she would do with the money she would get for the milk.  "I'll buy some fowls from Farmer Brown," said she, "and they will lay eggs each morning, which I will sell to the parson's wife.  With the money that I get from the sale of these eggs I'll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat; and when I go to market, won't all the young men come up and speak to me!  Polly Shaw will be that jealous; but I don't care.  I shall just look at her and toss my head like this.  As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail fell off it, and all the milk was spilt.

 A GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called together to consider the best means of protecting it from the enemy.  A Bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as affording the best material for an effective resistance.  A Carpenter, with equal enthusiasm, proposed timber as a preferable method of defense.

Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.  "Pardon, O King," cried the little Mouse: "forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?"  The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.  Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a tree while they went in search of a waggon to carry him on.  Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts.  "Was I not right?" said the little Mouse.	Kindness can be repaid in unexpected ways.	Metaphoric-370
A Fox swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long time very much bruised, sick, and unable to move.  A swarm of hungry blood-sucking flies settled upon him.  A Hedgehog, passing by, saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him.  "By no means," replied the Fox; "pray do not molest them."  "How is this?'  said the Hedgehog; "do you not want to be rid of them?'  "No," returned the Fox, "for these flies which you see are full of blood, and sting me but little, and if you rid me of these which are already satiated, others more hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the blood I have left."  	It is sometimes better to suffer mild discomfort than to struggle against it an be overcome by an even greater uncomfort.	Metaphoric-371
A blind man was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by touching them with his hands.  The whelp of a Wolf was brought him, with a request that he would feel it, and say what it was.  He felt it, and being in doubt, said:  "I do not quite know whether it is the cub of a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full well.  It would not be safe to admit him to the sheepfold."    	When dealing with the unknown, it is better to be safe than sorry.	Metaphoric-372
A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs.  But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep's clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.

An Ant nimbly running about in the sunshine in search of food came across a Chrysalis that was very near its time of change. The Chrysalis moved its tail, and thus attracted the attention of the Ant, who then saw for the first time that it was alive. "Poor, pitiable animal!" cried the Ant disdainfully. "What a sad fate is yours! While I can run hither and thither, at my pleasure, and, if I wish, ascend the tallest tree, you lie imprisoned here in your shell, with power only to move a joint or two of your scaly tail." The Chrysalis heard all this, but did not try to make any reply. A few days after, when the Ant passed that way again, nothing but the shell remained. Wondering what had become of its contents, he felt himself suddenly shaded and fanned by the gorgeous wings of a beautiful Butterfly. "Behold in me," said the Butterfly, "your much-pitied friend! Boast now of your powers to run and climb as long as you can get me to listen." So saying, the Butterfly rose in the air, and, borne along and aloft on the summer breeze, was soon lost to the sight of the Ant forever.	Pity is sometimes misplaced due to ignorance.	Metaphoric-374
An ass belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from his present service and provided with another master.  Jupiter, after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker.  Shortly afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he petitioned for another change of master.  Jupiter, telling him that it would be the last time that he could grant his request, ordained that he be sold to a tanner.  The Ass found that he had fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation, said, groaning:  "It would have been better for me to have been either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to him."

A king, whose only son was fond of martial exercises, had a dream in which he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion.  Afraid the dream should prove true, he built for his son a pleasant palace and adorned its walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a lion.  When the young Prince saw this, his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh, and, standing near the lion, he said: "O you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my father's, which he saw in his sleep, I am shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl:  what shall I now do to you?'  With these words he stretched out his hands toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he might beat the lion.  But one of the tree's prickles pierced his finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince fell down in a fainting fit.  A violent fever suddenly set in, from which he died not many days later. 	Dreams can inspire people to act strangely.	Metaphoric-376
A man had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the other to a tile-maker.  After a time he went to the daughter who had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all things went with her.  She said, "All things are prospering with me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of rain, in order that the plants may be well watered."  Not long after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, "I want for nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks might be dried."  He said to her, "If your sister wishes for rain, and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my wishes?'  	A person is divided between supporting two equally-important causes.

A man and a Satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them.  One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them.  When the Satyr asked the reason for this, he told him that he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold.  Later on in the day they sat down to eat, and the food prepared was quite scalding.  The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it.  When the Satyr again inquired the reason, he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot.  "I can no longer consider you as a friend," said the Satyr, "a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold."	Hot dishes need time to cool down.	Metaphoric-378

A kid, returning without protection from the pasture, was pursued by a Wolf.  Seeing he could not escape, he turned round, and said:  "I know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to which I may dance."  The Wolf complied, and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the Wolf.  Turning to the Kid, he said, "It is just what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher, should not have turned piper to please you."	Hounds can be use to chase a wolf away from livestock.

A prince had some Monkeys trained to dance.  Being naturally great mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils, and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well as any of the courtiers.  The spectacle was often repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts and threw them upon the stage.  The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys instead of actors.  Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes, they fought with one another for the nuts.  The dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.	A person can pretend to be something they are not, but will eventually show their true colors when their old ways prove too tempting.	Metaphoric-383
One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch.  "Just the thing to quench my thirst," quoth he.  Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch.  Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success.  Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour."

A Seagull having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die.

 A fox caught in a trap escaped, but in so doing lost his tail.  Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was exposed, he schemed to convince all the other Foxes that being tailless was much more attractive, thus making up for his own deprivation.  He assembled a good many Foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails, saying that they would not only look much better without them, but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush, which was a very great inconvenience.  One of them interrupting him said, "If you had not yourself lost your tail, my friend, you would not thus counsel us."	It is not always wise to encourage others to behave or appear as you do.

One day a cat happen to grab hold of rooster for its evening meal. She wanted, however, a good excuse for killing the bird.   "I need to rid the world of you," she told the rooster, "You constantly make your horrible noises throughout the night, interfering with men's much needed sleep. The world will be better off without you."  "No," said the rooster, "I crow for the good of men.

A Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell.  Many a time he tried to attack them; but whenever he came near they turned their tails to one another, so that whichever way he approached them he was met by the horns of one of them.  At last, however, they fell a-quarrelling among themselves, and each went off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field.  Then the Lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all four.	A group provides protection that individuals cannot provide on their own.	Metaphoric-388
An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two. A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape. In revenge, the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.

But the Rose replied with a shade of sadness in her voice, "Ah, my dear friend, I bloom but for a time: my petals soon wither and fall, and then I die. But your flowers never fade, even if they are cut; for they are everlasting."	Rose bushes must be pruned regularly to encourage new buds.	Metaphoric-390
A fox one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.  A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good.  Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend.  The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape.  "If," said he, "you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards."  The Goat readily assented and the Fox leaped upon his back.  Steadying himself with the Goat's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could.  When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, "You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape."

One wintry day a Woodman was tramping home from his work when he saw something black lying on the snow.  When he came closer he saw it was a Serpent to all appearance dead.  But he took it up and put it in his bosom to warm while he hurried home.  As soon as he got indoors he put the Serpent down on the hearth before the fire.  The children watched it and saw it slowly come to life again.  Then one of them stooped down to stroke it, but thc Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to sting the child to death.  So the Woodman seized his axe, and with one stroke cut the Serpent in two.  "Ah," said he, "No gratitude from the wicked."	When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, and striding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes. 	Metaphoric-392
A Crow perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find water, flew to it with delight.  When he reached it, he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it.  He tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain.  At last he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.

A Vixen who was taking her babies out for an airing one balmy morning, came across a Lioness, with her cub in arms. "Why such airs, haughty dame, over one solitary cub?" sneered the Vixen. "Look at my healthy and numerous litter here, and imagine, if you are able, how a proud mother should feel." The Lioness gave her a squelching look, and lifting up her nose, walked away, saying calmly, "Yes, just look at that beautiful collection. What are they? Foxes! I've only one, but remember, that one is a Lion."	The gods help them that help themselves.	Metaphoric-394
A Lion demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage.  The Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse his request, hit upon this expedient to rid himself of his importunities.  He expressed his willingness to accept the Lion as the suitor of his daughter on one condition:  that he should allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off his claws, as his daughter was fearfully afraid of both.  The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal.  But when the toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest.

 Two Frogs lived together in a marsh. But one hot summer the marsh dried up, and they left it to look for another place to live in: for frogs like damp places if they can get them. By and by they came to a deep well, and one of them looked down into it, and said to the other, "This looks a nice cool place. Let us jump in and settle here." But the other, who had a wiser head on his shoulders, replied, "Not so fast, my friend. Supposing this well dried up like the marsh, how should we get out again?"

A peacock spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that passed by, ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying, "I am robed, like a king, in gold and purple and all the colors of the rainbow; while you have not a bit of color on your wings." "True," replied the Crane; "but I soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my voice to the stars, while you walk below, like a cock, among the birds of the dunghill."  	Many birds feature evolutionary traits designed to attract sexual mates, such as the peacock's tail features.	Metaphoric-397
A Man who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of someone who might heal him.  A friend, meeting him and learning what he wanted, said, "If you would be cured, take a piece of bread, and dip it in the blood from your wound, and go and give it to the Dog that bit you."  The Man who had been bitten laughed at this advice and said, "Why? If I should do so, it would be as if I should beg every Dog in the town to bite me."  	A dog attacked a man, but it was not fatal.

A Cat fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus to change her into the form of a woman.  Venus consented to her request and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the youth saw her and loved her, and took her home as his bride.  While the two were reclining in their chamber, Venus wishing to discover if the Cat in her change of shape had also altered her habits of life, let down a mouse in the middle of the room.  The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started up from the couch and pursued the mouse, wishing to eat it.  Venus was much disappointed and again caused her to return to her former shape.

Some boys, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the water and began to pelt them with stones.

The Hares were so persecuted by the other beasts, they did not know where to go.  As soon as they saw a single animal approach them, off they used to run.  One day they saw a troop of wild Horses stampeding about, and in quite a panic all the Hares scuttled off to a lake hard by, determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual state of fear.  But just as they got near the bank of the lake, a troop of Frogs, frightened in their turn by the approach of the Hares scuttled off, and jumped into the water.  "Truly," said one of the Hares, "things are not so bad as they seem: "There is always someone worse off than yourself."	Frogs are afraid of rabbits.	Metaphoric-401
A  SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground.

Amazing buy on Splenda! The savings compared to the store was unbelievable. I use it since I'm diabetic, but the taste is great and I can still get that sugar taste with no bitter after taste.

The dark roast version is delicious, and I've received comments from friends as well.  Full flavor, delicious in the morning without half and half (and that's saying a lot)!  For those who said it was weak, I have one suggestion: you need to add more coffee.  In my Cuisinart coffee maker (the model that has a 'step' indicator on the right hand side) I use 3-1/2 scoops for 10 cups. Super saver is a great way to get the coffee as well.	The light roast blend is almost as good, but needs more flavor.	Reviews-404
I have heard of winegums for a while now, and read the reviews on these--and the reviewers are absolutely right in saying that these are the most flavorful, delectable chewy-gummy candy I've ever had!!  My family opened one of the bags and started raving, so I had to have a taste. AMAZING!!  And Amazon has THE BEST PRICE I could find, BY FAR.  Less than $20 for 6.6 lbs of this candy is a bargain. Once again, the English ROCK!	Wine gummies a great snack for wine lovers who want the taste but can't drink for whatever reason.	Reviews-405
This is my favorite cereal. When we have it in the house I eat it every day, sometimes twice a day, so it doesn't last long. I'm a big fan of sticky cereal, and what I mean by that is cereal that is not soggy but not out-of-the-box crunchy, either. This cereal turns to oatmeal mush fairly quickly (I hate oatmeal, oddly), so if you like it less-than-soggy, you have to be quick or go easy on the milk. It tastes fantastic, though. It's not too sugary nor does it taste like cardboard. It's just right, honestly, and it's a lot healthier than a lot of other cereals (although it is not the healthiest). A bowl of this while watching LOTR is a perfectly comforting combination for some reason. (:	My brother and I used to joke that Grape-nuts was made of either wood or cardboard.	Reviews-406
After reading Wheatbelly (from Amazon), I've finally come to terms with the need to go really low-carb and avoid grains. But what to do about the need to snack and dip occasionally?

High carb snacks mess with my insulin levels, leaving me feeling drained all day.	Reviews-407
Great noodles, but a little spicy. If you like spicy then put the whole flavor packet in bowl but if I like mine a little less spicy so only put half or 3/4 of packet and it comes out tasty.

I like all kinds of mac and cheese.  My homemade version uses cream, Beecher's cheese and Dungeness crab.  But then on the other hand, I also like both Stouffer's and Trader Joe's frozen, and I even like the stuff in the blue box.  Read a lot of rave reviews of Annie's, so I picked up a box at the store today.  I'm not sure what kind of mac and cheese the people that loved this stuff have eaten in the past, but I found Annie's watery and bland.  I think it might be passable if there was twice the amount of cheese powder, but this stuff had no flavor.  Ate a couple bites and threw the rest out.  Luckily I only bought one box, but it was a complete waste of money.  Even Easy Mac is better.	Annie's mac and cheese is a waste of money - watery and bland, despite its rave reviews.	Reviews-410
This is my first for adventure into yellow curry paste, and I love it.  Even though it is not as hot as some of the other curry's, the level of spice and flavor does not disappoint.  I followed the recipe on the side of the container.  It does use the European scale of measurement that at first was a little intimidating.  I did notice under nutrition, that it it listed 2 teaspoons is 10 GRAMS.  That means that 50 grams is 10 teaspoons.  There is no law that says you can't use more.  I intend to hit the net for more recipes, plus i have some of my own ideas, HEY,FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

I had a bowl of these todasy for breakfast. I put two fried eggs on top and added a little hot sauce I made yesterday. The noodles have a decent firmness and the broth was tasty.

When I first tried this tea over a year ago, I was instantly in love. This tea has a light but rich taste; the roasted rice lends itself well and almost gives this tea a buttery quality. The quality of the tea leaves themselves is great, with a beautiful deep green color. The tea is worth the price, but it comes with an added bonus: if you buy this online here, you get two tins instead of one-- perfect for gifting or sharing. This tea is a tea I would serve to someone who claims to hate green teas, just to showcase the variety green teas can have.	Buying this tea from amazon gets you a two-for-one deal.	Reviews-418
I've never tried the Celtic Sea Salt before but have read a lot about it being better than regular salt for you.  I bought this and am very pleased except that I believe I would have preferred to have bought the fine ground.  This works great for cooking but you need a grinder to use at the table.  Tastes just like salt.  I can't tell any difference in taste from the iodized table salt.  It definitely looks different.  It's a moist gray color.  Very pleased.  Converting over to this as I empty out the salt grinders.  Can't tell you how it reacts to the grinders yet.	Celtic sea salt tastes just like regular sea salt but it comes in these large granules that are big enough that I have to use a grinder to add the salt to food.	Reviews-419
I love popcorn. We have popcorn about 4 nights a week. I started out looking for popcorn on the cob as I had that this year and it was lovely, and then stumbled upon India Tree. It's the closest that I can find to the dried on the cob popcorn and I love it. It is so fresh and natural tasting. I've been using it for several months and ran out the other day and had to use a popular store brand. Though the kernels popped up larger, the taste was stale and processed...not to mention, the India Tree popcorn is actually cheaper than the store brand. I'm placing my order for more India Tree right now!	Sweet corn isn't ideal for popcorn because its kernels don't pop as large.	Reviews-420
I ordered these treats as they looked similar to the Waggin Train Chick'n Biscuit. Well, they are nothing like them. My dogs love the product from Waggin Train, but would not eat these.

i don't like to knock a product..however i have used stevia for quite a number of years now. my favorite is the 3.5 oz Kal pure stevia exract there are no fillers.. unfortunately i have 1 lb of this NOW brand and i noticed right away that it is no way near as potent as the Kal brand....this powder is not as dense as KAL.. it is true you will have to double or maybe triple the amount you normally would use in your drink/i have not cooked with this... it does not dissolve as quickly as KAL and does'nt have that nice sweetness i am used to ...i will finish it and that will be that. maybe the product needs to be compacted..i'm not sure though...	This stevia sweetener is much healthier than what you'll find in the sucralose in Splenda.	Reviews-422
When I took this product, my skin cleared up a lot but I soon began to have digestive problems.  I probably need to play with how much water to dilute it in.

Wow Sun Maid -- you NEVER disappoint!!!I baked these muffins, even adding pineapple, as suggested on the side of the box -- the muffins (all 12 of them) came out of the oven as scrumptious, semi-moist morsels of perfection, right up to the slightly crispy but still juicy raisins on the tops of each muffin.They stored well - I eventually put them (covered with foil) in the fridge, and now I am taking the remainder to work with me.You only need one egg per mix, and some oil or butter, and liquid (in my case I used pineapple juice as liquid) -- it takes very little time to mix (I used a big big serving fork to mix up the batter with) and they pop into and out of the oven in no time.The price is right and the result is delicious!!!	Substituting in pineapple juice (instead of water) can add a great kick to this muffin mix.	Reviews-424
I ordered the extract to make rose ice cream, because you can rarely find it.  The ice cream turned out really great with this flavoring.  I used 1 1/4 teaspoons to flavor about 3 cups of ice cream.

I've been looking for this gum for a long time.  For some reason, I haven't been able to find Rain-blo at my local stores. They only carry Dubble Bubble- which I don't like because the flavor doesn't last long. The gum was delivered quickly and was fresh tasting.  The package brings 48 packages (4 gums per pack).  Just in case you were wondering, the gum balls are medium seized - not the jumbo or smaller bite sized options. You end up paying about .27 per package, not a bad deal. Definitely worth it.	This Rain-blo gum is a good deal, especially if your local stores don't carry it.	Reviews-428

I am using this flour to make the recipes in Bruce Fife's book that I just purchased Cooking with Coconut Flour.  The cookies and breads have great texture, I love the fried chicken, and the italian meatloaf.  Very glad that I bought the flour AND the book because coconut flour is difficult to experiment with as it soaks up moisture like a sponge. Turns out you need to add more fat, not water or milk, if you want the batter to be moister.	Coconut flour can be difficult to cook with because it absorbs more water than the more commonly-used wheat flour.	Reviews-431

The Brazil nuts I ordered came quickly, very quickly. I was surprised that the 5 little bags I ordered were so little, but it makes sense.

I'm addicted to Yogi Teas and have vowed to try them all.  This Indian Spice tea is delicious. I've found that many of the Yogi teas are not as strong as I want them to be, so the tea bag stays in until I've drank all the tea. Not so with this tea, this tea has a VERY strong Cinnamon taste, which I find enjoyable. In truth, I may have left the bag in too long today, as the cinnamon flavor is burning a little.The directions on the box say to add milk (or milk substitute) and sweetener to the tea. They mean it. I tried to drink it plain, but couldn't, it just didn't taste right. However, I did add a popular flavored coffee creamer, and that worked beautifully.  This is a whole new drink now, doesn't feel like tea, it feels like a treat. Enjoy.	Most Yogi teas are a bit weak and I have to leave the tea bag in the cup until I've finished it to get the right flavor.	Reviews-435
As an all natural product this is a good cereal.  I don't eat sweetened products so this product is fine with me.  It's hard stuff and takes a while to eat.

This is my favorite coconut water, and I think I've tried almost all of them at this point (fresh is always best, but that's expensive and hard to come by). I first found Taste Nirvana in California, in the smaller glass bottles, and loved it, but couldn't find it after returning to MD. Then I found them on Facebook and subsequently on Amazon, and I have been subscribed to 2 cases per month ever since (and am upping to 3 cases). The glass one may or may not taste better, but this is a larger container and is far cheaper. Now the stores near me carry this brand, but it's still cheaper to get on Amazon, and the plain, no-pulp cans are still not available near me.	Gatorade and other energy or sport drinks are a good source of electrolytes after intense workouts, which can leave your body's supply low and lead to uncomfortable cramping.	Reviews-437

I have used this shampoo along with it's matching conditioner for a while now and using the two of them together really makes a difference with my dry and itchy scalp. The shampoo is thin but super rich and I really notice the added moisture to my scalp. The shampoo feels like it has conditioner in it as well. I usually wash my hair twice with the shampoo and then I use the super thick and rich conditioner and leave in on my hair for about a minute and then rinse. My hair is left very healthy, smooth and rich with moisture. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a nice scent.

I am the grandma who is constantly dieting and I have a toddler granddaughter who literally hates to eat. This product helps both of us! It is a very healthy no sugar added, fat free snack. I eat the veggies one piece at a time. They are crunchy and literally melt in  my mouth. I am amazed at how good they are. My granddaughter also likes them. She is a picky eater and she also eats one piece at a time. Now I know she is getting nutrition instead of eating junk food. Yes, they are expensive, but you aren't going to be sitting around eating these by the spoonful like you would regular cooked veggies. I have only eaten them so far as a snack, but I am looking for ways to include them in my salads. These  snacks are also good for my grandson who is just learning to eat regular food. They are small enough and dissolve in the mouth and I won't worry about him choking (I always feed him under supervision!) These snacks are worth a try.

miracle noodles are a great option for people who are on a low carb diet but enjoy/crave noodles from time to time. Yes, they smell coming out of the package.  Rinse thoroughly.  They do not smell or taste funny once prepared. The texture is more like a rice noodle/cellophane noodle as opposed to wheat pasta. I prefer the angel hair pasta more than the rice, which reminds me of Israeli couscous or orzo.	Though they smell a bit when first opened, Miracle Noodles are a huge help for those who need rice noodles but are on a low-carb diet.	Reviews-446

This pumpkin spice tea makes a great pitcher of Iced Tea, with a bit of Truvia or Splenda to sweeten it.  The only down side is I couldn't find it after the fall in my area, but now that I found amazon has it, I've got it on a subscription so I'll be sure to have plenty!  Oh, and if you will only use a given flavor occasionally, Bigelow is the way to go, since each Tea Bag is individually foil wrapped to keep it fresh.

Over a decade ago, Lion's brand coffees were okay (personally I never thought they were as good as some people did; but whatever, they were at least acceptable).  Lately, this brand has tanked to the point of undrinkability.  I would advise you not to waste your money; and advise the Lion's Brand company to reconsider marketing swill to a formerly loyal customer base.	The coffee tastes completely burnt so to drink it at all you have completely water down the taste.	Reviews-451
I have been using all of Nielsen-Massey's Vanillas over the years and by FAR this is the BEST Tahitian Vanillia you can get at this price.  There are others out there that can range as high as $95.00 for the same general amount, but they are of rare variety which makes them far more expensive for the average baker.  I have been baking since I was 15 years old (47 now) and have used many differnt forms of Vanilla extracts over the years.  My heart and taste lies with Nielsen-Massey.	Recent studies have shown that consumers prefer the taste of artificial vanilla to the naturally-derived taste, which is due to the artificial variety being made from pure vanillin, the same substance that gives the vanilla beans their flavor.

This is my favorite green tea.  I tried many different kinds when I was cutting back on coffee and this was the best.  It is the perfect blend of green tea flavor and jasmine, not too flowery.  It has a wonderful smell as well.  I enjoyed drinking and smelling this tea as much as I had previously enjoyed my first morning coffee.  Also the tea bag material makes it easier to save and rebrew for a second serving.	After I switched from coffee to tea, this green tea has been my go-to choice so much that i look forward to it in the mornings just as much as that first cup of coffee.	Reviews-453
This is a great sugar replacement.  It is sweet and you can use it in hot and cold foods and for baking.  The main ingredient- xylitol-is good for your teeth.

I have liked every flavour of Harney & Sons tea that I have tried. The peppermint is no exception. It has a very strong/rich flavour that I have found to be lacking in some of the lesser brands of peppermint tea that I have encountered.	Blech, blech, blech. 	Reviews-456
High fructose corn syrup costs a few cents less per gallon than real sugar, so that's the sweetener they use here. The good news is they offer Simply Heinz, which is made with real sugar. The taste is noticeably better and while the corn lobby wants you to believe otherwise, my bet is that the real sugar is healthier.  For a condiment that lasts for months, do yourself a favor and spend the extra few cents to get the good stuff.	Simply Heinz contains real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrups, so it's worth the investment since ketchup is kept for months and real sugar tastes better.	Reviews-457
This was my 1st time trying the Snickers Peanut Butter Squared candy bars.  They were delicious.  I had waited long enough to order them when the heat of summer was gone so they wouldn't melt.  The product was boxed and packaged well.Everything arrived quickly and I used the free shipping so kudos to the seller.  I'd use this seller again.  They were great.	The m&m's candy bars, however, were gross and had a weird mixture of nougat and candy pieces.	Reviews-458

You might not think, from reading ingredients, that this cereal has gluten in it, but it does.  While the cereal tastes yummy and has decent nutritional content, if you are gluten-sensitive, stay away.  I tried it twice and both times spent hours doubled over in agony.  I suspect the gluten source has to do with how the oats are processed.  I wish food producers would realize that celiac disease is no joke and be very careful about product labeling.

I was a bit skeptical.  My wife likes Mojito's in the summer and I'm pretty good at making them.  However, they can be a bit heavy on the sugar/sweet side.This mix was pretty good and easy to make (there was no bad aftertaste, either).  Put it in a tall glass with some ice.  If you're a fan of CL lemonade or other instant drinks, this is a decent substitution or if you just want or have the non-alcoholic versions.  I would purchase this product and use it.	This dry mojito mix is a good substitute for the real thing if you're busy and isn't too sweet like mojitos can be when you make them yourself.	Reviews-464
When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this puppy goo.  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!	Expiration dates on the dog food cans vary significantly within the same package so be sure to read the labels.	Reviews-465

A friend got me to try this dip.  I wasn't too wild on the idea of onions and horseradish but it turns out this dip is highly addictive.  It's extremely tasty and makes anything taste better.  I am, however, a bit surprised at the price here; Robert Rothschild has a website and the price is considerably lower.  This is my favorite dip.	Does taste a little like cotton candy, not very sweet or premium (as described).  	Reviews-467
This product is incredible and very different from the normal canned 'bitter' tomato paste. It is expensive but well worth it for certain uses.

We happened to be at Whole Foods and a lovely woman was offering free samples of Violas Hot Jalepeno Jelly. Omg It is fantastic! It's got a definite kick to it but it's not too terribly hot at all. PERFECTION. It's just sweet enough to balance out the hot. It's light and delicious. And best of all, it's not full of all the artificial preservatives and high fructose corn syrup and additives of which most jellies are contaminated.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!

These newer shortbread cookies from Walkers are so yummy.

This food works out to be the best dry food for my overweight senior cat. I was trying grain-free foods for a while and he just gained a lot of weight and became constipated. Mixing it with this food helps reduce those problems. My cats do well on it and seem to like the taste of it, too. The small round kibble size is convenient for treat balls and automatic feeders. I feed them wet food twice daily, and then leave portions of the dry food mix out while I'm at work or sleeping so they have something to snack on. I would not recommend feeding exclusively dry food, but if you do feed some then this one seems like a good choice to try.	This food works great with most automatic cat food dispensers, which is ideal for working people or those with busy households.	Reviews-472
I like almost every tea I've ever tried (both bagged and loose), but this oolong tea was terrible. It actually tasted like dirt and I had to pour it out.

I'd been looking for an apple preserve and Harvest Song seemed to fit the bill. They've got a wonderfully idyllic print marketing campaign so I thought I'd take a chance.As it turns out, the aluminum lid on the jar has no protective liner. My first 1/8 of a teaspoon was filled with metal! The acid in the jam had corroded the interior of the lid, producing scratch marks that looked like someone scratched it with the tines of a fork.I'm calling Amazon to see if they'll refund on defective food. Really people... run for your lives.UPDATE:I felt a little sick from this product but it cleared up in about 12 hours. When I felt better I called Amazon (through the Contact Us link near the bottom of the page) and received a full refund. Thanks for the great customer service Amazon.	This jam is so acidic that it ate through the metal lid, making the top of the jam filled with metal.	Reviews-477
Very soft and yummy cookies. I bought these for my gluten-intolerant daughter and wound up liking them myself!  They have other flavors that are also very good.

This is very good coffee at an excellent price. I like a dark roast and ordered this not realizing that Vienna roast is more of a light roast. If I had ordered a darker roast from them I might have been able to give them 5 stars. In any case, I'm pretty sure I'll order their coffee again -- maybe the Sumatran next time.

Just had this for the first time at PF Chang's in Sacramento yesterday.  I was utterly amazed at how good it is and I am a tough critic, having been a long-time Earl Grey lover.  It's great with food because the taste is light and refreshing; it's also delicious, by the way.  It's perfect for summertime, perfect frosty cold with lots of ice.  And it's real tea, not a powder.  It smells so good I almost want to wear it! Can you tell?  I LOVE this tea!	This Earl Grey tea is real tea (not powder) and better than everything else because the taste is delicious, light, and so refreshing.	Reviews-481
This is a smoky, creamy, and just very mildly spicy sauce.  If that's what you're looking for you'd likely enjoy it a lot, but for me, it made figuring out just what to do with it a little difficult.  Typically when I make tacos, etc, I just use salsa, sour cream, and sometimes hot sauce, so I'm struggling a bit to figure out where this fits in exactly.  It tastes good, but seems almost unnecessary.  One use that seems to work pretty well is adding it to a taco salad.  It's kind of a nice addition to keep the flavors a bit more interesting and I might keep some around for that.  It could also add a bit of variety to sandwiches if one is in the mood for something a little different than the norm; perhaps on a southwest style Panini or similar.  I might also try it for dipping chicken nuggets or wings, etc.  Overall it seems like a pretty good product, but not something I'd be likely to use daily or even a couple times a week, so I may pick up a bottle every now and then but I probably won't buy a 6-pack of them.  I would rate it perhaps 4 stars on taste but it loses a few points for versatility since it's not really hot sauce, taco sauce, salsa, sandwich spread, or salad dressing, it's kind of something else that I have trouble classifying.	There's a good amount of raisins, but the almonds are rather sparse.	Reviews-482
I have been drinking Whey Up since 2007 and I LOVE IT!  There is not another protein energy drink on the market that tastes as good or works as well.  I drink at least one Whey UP a day and can certainly feel my energy levels increase when i drink it before a work out.  It's also been a great source of meal replacement with 20g of protein and again, it tastes GREAT!  I even pack bottles of WHEYUP when I travel and have gone to great measures to get more WHEY UP if i run out.  People who work out should drink WHEYUP for the protein energy boost they get before going to the gym.  I have also pointed out to people that are dieting that they should drink WHEYUP as a meal replacement (once a day) and then keep filling the bottle with water for the rest of the day.  I love that AMAZON is now selling WHEY UP and everyone should try it!	A nice benefit of having a protein shaker is being able to fill it up with water after and keep drinking throughout the day to stay hydrated.	Reviews-483

This is the best dark cocoa I have ever had!  It makes incredible mochas and hot chocolate and I use hardly any sugar in it (I like it a little bitter) and it makes a mocha better than Starbucks, Ryan Bros, Butch Bros, Peets - anyone.  It makes me feel good knowing there's a lot less sugar,  but I do wonder about the fat content as it seems a lil bit on the high side.  This stuff is the good stuff.  If I could give it 10 stars I would!	This dark cocoa is fantastic and ideal for making better mochas and hot chocolates than what you'll get in any commercial coffee place.	Reviews-487

I purchased this wine a while back, directions are great. Only problem I had was opening the bags of concentrate! Very difficult, other than that when bottling the wine the flavor is great!

****I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.The manufacturer writes: Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.****	The bergamot does not taste too soapy at all.

This is the best Ghee that I have tried but perhaps it is because it is the only Ghee that I have tried!  It tastes more oily than buttery and it doesn't add much flavor to foods which could be a plus or a minus depending on what you are cooking.  I am trying to avoid Casein and this product has been very helpful in sticking to that avoidance!	Although I've only ever tried this Ghee, it seems to do the job but is a bit more oily than butter.

This is a tasty little instant coffee. You can smell the light and refreshing mint as soon as you start stirring it up. The chocolate flavor is delicious and the mint is very uplifting. I felt like I was experiencing a little bit of aromatherapy! It's almost a slight menthol sort of fresh, clean, peppermint scent and flavor.While regular hot chocolate is cozy and warm, this has a bit more caffeine from the coffee and with the energizing peppermint added to it, it makes for a really nice afternoon pick-me-up.And compared to getting coffee out at big name coffee shops (as much as I enjoy that coffee too), this is very economical. Gotta love an affordable indulgence! Thank you, Maxwell House!yum! :)	Hot chocolate with whipped cream and maybe a dash of peppermint really hits the spot on a cold winter's day.	Reviews-493
I used this flour to make homemade egg noodles, and they were really gross! They smelled like vegetables and tasted even worse. I've made gluten-free noodles before with a white rice flour blend, and they turned out great. I recommend Whole Foods 365 brand or Gluten Free Pantry brand all purpose flours (1st ingredient white rice flour) for cooking and baking.

I'm pretty sure this is the same sauce they use at Taco Bell on the Baja Gordita and Chalupa.  It is pretty mild, so you can use it generously!  The texture is a little thicker than the other Taco Bell sauces, so this works best as a sandwich spread, since it won't run off as easily as the other varities.  I also like it as a hamburger topping, but this is a nice chicken dipping sauce too.  If you're making taco salad, this is the dressing of choice!	This taco sauce's consistency is a bit thicker than Taco Bell's.	Reviews-496
Yes!!! I finally found a quality food that all 3 of my cats love! I have tried several others(halo,paul newman,taste of the wild,core,and others)and this is the first one I can tell that they really go wild over.Plus the price is not as high as some of the high quality foods.If they continue to love it this much and get along well with it I will definatley continue to buy this brand.Would have done 5 stars but it is pricey for normal people and kind of inconvenient to always be buying at a pet store or online but I do like it well.	Granny smith is the best flavor to get in my opinion. 	Reviews-497
We trust Beneful and these days with so many scary stories about dogs getting sick from treats or dog food that is made in China, it is very important to trust.
