As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist Japanese jokes .
Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .
The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .
Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market .
Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .
It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .
The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .

scenario that will give most parents pause ... Then , something terrible happens .
Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .
Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .

It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .

Apparently writer-director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .
This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .

It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '

Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
There are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .

An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .
Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .

Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
A grating , emaciated flick .
Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .
We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .

The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
Ararat feels like a book report

Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .

If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot .
A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .
Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . '

The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .

Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material
The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .
They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .

Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .
The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people .
` Snow Dogs ' has both .
It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .

It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
Ken Russell would love this .

The Rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer CGI effects .
The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .
The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .
Opera on film is never satisfactory .
The art demands live viewing .
The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .
It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .

There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .
It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .

A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .
Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .
A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .
We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .
It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .
Bravado Kathy !

Something must have been lost in the translation .

plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .
The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .
This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .
I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead -LRB- water -RRB- weight of the other .
The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .
Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .
After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... '
A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .
Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .
It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .
-LRB- The film 's -RRB- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .
Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .
Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .
It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .
The camera whirls !
The camera twirls !
Oh , look at that clever angle !
Wow , a jump cut !
Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .
Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
-LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
A ragbag of cliches .
This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .
The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .

The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .
The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .
No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .
One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .
Proof of this is Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever .

Every joke is repeated at least four times .
Every joke is repeated at least four times .
Every joke is repeated at least -- annoying , is n't it ?
Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
-LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .
A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .
Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .

An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .

Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .
The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .
The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
More a gunfest than a Rock concert .
It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .
It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
It 's not original enough .
A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games .
A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .
For free .
I still want my money back .
It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .
... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .
Strictly middle of the road .
Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .

No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .

Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .
A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .
Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of -LRB- François and Michèle 's -RRB- relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .
They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .
Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .
Enigma lacks it .
Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .
A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
Rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .

But , no , we get another scene , and then another .
You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .

An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .

I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
Dreary tale of middle-class angst

Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
-LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .
It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .

Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .
The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .

I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .
But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .

I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .

The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of Amélie .
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .
If there ai n't none , you have a problem .
The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .
Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
The drama discloses almost nothing .
A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .
And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .
Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
But it does n't need Gangs of New York .
Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with Cage 's best acting .
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .
It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
... a rather bland affair .
Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .
The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .
Harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .
Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world .
Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
If you go , pack your knitting needles .
The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
We do n't even like their characters .
Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .
Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? ''
- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .
One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .
-LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .
Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
You have no affinity for most of the characters .
Nothing about them is attractive .
What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .
An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying .
Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .
Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .
No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda .
Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
How about surprising us by trying something new ?
Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .
Too bad none of it is funny .
The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
Oh , and more entertaining , too .
... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
The film is strictly routine .
Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .
In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .
You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
If you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in Anne Geddes , John Grisham , and Thomas Kincaid .
We get the comedy we settle for .
The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .

Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
Hey Arnold !
is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .
Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .
That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
As pedestrian as they come .
A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .
More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
As saccharine as it is disposable .
You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
Too much power , not enough puff .
The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
Muddled , trashy and incompetent
For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
`` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...
One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .
The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true .
It 's a masterpiece .
It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
They crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .
Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .
Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
Catch it ... if you can !
Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '
American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
The script is smart , not cloying .
Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .
A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
An ambitious ` what if ? '
that works .
`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
Nice piece of work .
` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
Yep , it 's `` Waking up in Reno . ''
Go back to sleep .
I did n't laugh .
I did n't smile .
I survived .
The worst film of the year .
In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition
A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .
Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants .
Taken as a whole , The Tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .
This is no `` Waterboy ! ''
Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .
... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .
I ca n't recommend it .
But it 's surprisingly harmless .
What 's next ?
The Porky 's Revenge : Ultimate Edition ?
The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
Is `` Ballistic '' worth the price of admission ?
Absolutely not .
It sucked .
Would I see it again ?
Please see previous answer .
It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
`` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this Cliff Notes edition is a cheat .
A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
If only it were , well , funnier .
The script ?
Please .
Does n't add up to much .
One of the worst movies of the year .
A complete waste of time .
Long before it 's over , you 'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser .
One of the worst movies of the year .
... Watching it was painful .
The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .

cumberbatch . . . does not let us down .
i love the tone writer/director andrew dominik establishes in the film; it 's the dragging-it-out-to-160-minutes part that gets me down .

it is now a great starting point for someone new to this franchise . to quote one of the familiar lines from this space opera - "the force is strong with this one"!
"the darjeeling limited" is a quirky , sophisticated movie that 's kind of a comedy and definitely a road trip with very little plot .
even when it descends into self-consciousness in a lurid final act , "out of the furnace" effectively brings viewers into a space where whatever people had to lose was either squandered or stolen .

this is woody allen in peak form . he has stripped out that jabbering new york paranoia and gleefully poked a big stick at america 's ruling class .

if you haven 't read the book , do so . this is the first 150 minutes of the final novel adaptation (part two next spring) and to me it was virtual gobbledegook .
a thoroughly modern twist on the classic noir , framed for our modern times in contemporary moscow , where the gap between the haves and the have nots is stark .
though this movie is indefensible in terms of virtually any critical standard i can call to mind , i wouldn 't have wanted to miss a single second of it .
the only wit on display here is roger moore plummily intoning the phrase "butt-sniffing ."
it 's certainly interesting to see what 's been reported on the manipulation of information played out as drama , and the acting is uniformly good .

"the dilemma" is never dull , but it 's also a mess .
around the hour mark , the movie takes a turn for the worse . not to give too much away , but it pretty much turns into a dumber , gory thriller .
the careworn marion cotillard is a suitable icon for this most commendable of morals on the perils of neglecting social responsibility during these hardened , austere times .

guided by the principle that action movies have become generic that anybody can be plugged into the hero role and the results would be no different than if arnold schwarzenegger or bruce willis was the star .
delicate and sturdy .
in terms of modern sexual politics , it 's a pointed celebration of how some female lovers look , see , understand , empathize and argue with , and touch each other .

an uneven picture that 's at times poignant and at times quite funny , but ultimately lacks a consistent flow .

anderson 's inclination to stupefy and stir before inevitably satisfying makes phantom thread such an immaculate piece of emotional warfare , both for its leading players and its entranced viewers .

skyfall is a tad leaner on action , but it 's certainly incredibly meaty on plot , glued together with the perfectly pitched tone and mood , and delivered with some delectable cinematography .
about the only thing ineffective about breach is the humdrum title . everything else in this smart thriller works like a perfectly crafted latin square puzzle .
sometimes it works but more often it just feels corny and obvious .
dig just a shade beneath the surface , trade in the text for the subtext , and a more interesting picture emerges - a little richer , sadder , almost poignant .
summerland carries a big heart and enough magic to make it a place worth visiting .

the game 's afoot , and the foot knows kung fu .
without sufficient context , the films swirls grandly but without making much meaning .
the presentation [of mountain music]evokes its deep emotions and a beauty that comes from life experience , not the pre-packaged pap courtesy of slick marketing types .
there is not a false note in the movie .
the various set-pieces (including an accidentally acquired piglet defecating in the car) never manage to deliver any big laughs and have to settle for being moderately amusing instead .
becoming jane may fudge the facts , but it finds the more compelling emotional truth .
a last act full of reversals would have filled in the holes in cavite .
theron takes to the fight choreography like a violent fish to bloody water . she is exactingly brutal and nearly balletic in her execution .
though not for the squeamish or fans of fascism , this morbidly bewitching fantasy is an enchanting , escapist fairy tale , even if one designed strictly with adults in mind .
the sources of the scares are all over the place but come fast-and-furious-enough to keep us guessing; you 're sure to jump more than once as you search the shadows for movement .
a solid-enough return that doesn 't totally disappoint and leaves enough goodwill (and room for improvement) for a third outing .
the mix of real history and imagined events results in filmmaking of high quality , despite the gaps and possible confusion of the foreign story .
napoleon dynamite behind the microphone , fish puts his life on the silver screen .
most of the time "baywatch" plays too much like an episode of "baywatch ," as though the filmmakers had filmed a straight-faced script written in 1995 by mistake .
linklater defines his characters by their relationships , hopes , choices and weaknesses -- not , as so many directors do , by their particular socioeconomic circumstances .
it would take a hard heart for someone not to have a tear in their eye at the conclusion of this one , however hard it leans on cliché .
i want a coherently-told story; i don 't want the feeling of rushing from scene to scene .
a wondrous work of the imagination and , to date , the year 's best film .
there 's a deranged celebration of the ultra-most hedonistic kind . but aside from all the intentional misguided ribaldry being shown , blade ii shamlessly wiggles about in overwrought and ponderous fashion .
quirky rather than hilarious and nowhere near as scary or gruesome as the play , this affectionate if overlong love letter to summer-stock theatre from director john stimpson may be too light on laughs and carnage for some .

a timely and powerful exploration into the history of uprising in africa as seen through the eyes of white liberals .

zach clark goes down dark-comic alleys , but he 's made a transfixing film about a dysfunctional family that looks touchingly and unnervingly like yours and mine .
there are a few laugh-out-loud moments . . . enough to recommend it for its feelgood factor .
there isn 't a character in the square you can care about , beyond pity for their foolishness and exasperation with their greed .
the film spends much too much time going over the same rise-and-fall material that has been a staple of many portrayals of escobar himself and of most gangster films going back to the 1930 's .
an interesting and generally entertaining addition to a genre that is often characterized by a lack of creativity and mindless repetition
the musical numbers are the only real drag on this otherwise odd and appealing picture .
if this was a biscuit , it would be an own-label digestive , full of sugar and trans fats - but suited and booted in a glistening wrapper .

a gorgeous and grotesque korean film by director kim ki-duk , who seems torn by his artistic and exploitive impulses .
aside from a few clumsy insert shots , bruce lee doesn 't even appear until the final 20 minutes!
goosebumps feels like a tongue-in-cheek kids action adventure from the 80s -- such as gremlins or the goonies -- and deserves to sit beside them in the genre .

the special effects are seamless while the entire production design on the outer space sequences has a sense of realism and lived-in feel to it .
if there was ever a film that made you want to pretend you were ray milland in the last reel of 'x ' , this was it .
ransom won 't be lighting the world 's blue touchpaper , but it 's a good , solid movie -- in other words , just what we 've come to expect of the erstwhile richie cunningham .
a beauty on-screen , but lacking a developed theme .
sorvino brings a spark , but neither she nor patti lupone , in an amusing cameo , can overcome the clockwork-like plod to the end .
like this awards season 's other scientific british biopic the imitation game , the film suffers from a squeamish reluctance to really engage with the harsh realities of its story .
a hypnotic disaster that 's truly fascinating - if only for all the wrong reasons .
another flawed , but fun animated film featuring the man of steel .
good time seems destined to be a cult classic . it 's carried off with such a dazzling intent , and it 's got real dramatic ingenuity to go with its more obvious focus on ambience
beyond dispute is the fact that maria callas is one of life 's greatest characters , not only in opera but in any field . . . [full review in spanish]
because there 's no time for these three to develop as impassioned characters , all this soap opera tedium does is devalue the real human catastrophe unspooling alongside it .

at the heart of this film by emily harris and ate de jong is a credible , intimate portrait of two people deeply in love but unsure where they 're going .
seraphine is a fascinating story (and the film is beautiful to look at) , but in the end , the movie leaves a lot of questions about the real-life seraphine unanswered .
a very funny and touching family drama about the wisdom that often comes not with success but with failure .
cheesy fun .
the sets frequently look chintzy and cheap , with santa 's workshop bringing to mind a prison sweat shop as much as a toy factory .
delves into a standard caper film full of cons and double-crosses . and as those types of films go , it 's really not too bad .
if you liked the original movie , you might like this remake as well .
such a fun , enjoyable and funny romantic comedy it probably would have been the biggest box office hit in the genre since the proposal . lucky for netflix and its viewers .

full review in greek
this film is not exactly a defining moment of anything , past or present , but it offers a compelling peek at an important point in time .
if you 're a fan of westerns or you simply enjoy your action movies presented with some deeper concepts than "kill 'em all ," this forgotten little flick is worth a look .
if you want my opinion-and i am way outside (think pluto) the intended audience-forget this often crass effort about the double-headed love gymnastics involving bffs in the big apple . it 's just not all that appealing a rom-com .
features a shameless cross-promotion we had better get used to in this era of media conglomerates . the script could be mistaken for the portfolio of the time-warner empire .
a sloppy , implausible slasher movie .
sin city is jazzed by excess , by the thrill of crafting a sharp-edged , high-contrast shadow world where it 's hard to tell the difference between cartoons and reality .
zany is the bullseye of shazam! and , boy , is that all kinds of satisfaction .
this expertly made film is utterly mesmerising . and its exploration of ruthless ambition is still fiercely timely .
the film has so much potential , but it 's a shame that it all falls flat .
a fascinating portrait of empowerment gone awry .
though it is more ambitious in scope , the raid 2 remains , primarily , a visceral pulp action movie , and this is where it truly soars .
part of the fun of duncan jones 's frequently clever sci-fi thriller is being as in-the-dark as the film 's protagonist .
this is a neat , well-crafted three-hander , making good use of its location; it really is a meaty role for bell , who lets rip in what might be his most eye-catching part since billy elliot .
was the conclusion unforeseen ? definitely . did it make me think about or learn something about the human condition ? not really .
style alone doesn 't make a great documentary , substance does , and on that count fed up absolutely delivers .
[lee 's] hard , brutal oldboy tackles that mind-bending , subversive story without flinching .
esteves 's curious multi-strand film carries us to a quietly devastating conclusion .
the setup is formula , but bullock and reynolds supply surprising fizz and kick .
it has such a nihilistic nature and lack of resolution that rather than high stakes , there 's nothing at stake .
sometimes a film critic has to throw himself or herself on a bomb for the good of the movie-going public .
there 's a constantly gorgeous surface -- a handsome hero , lots of bright technicolor -- and a constant moral rot at play underneath .
the insipid quality of the writing strands both characters in narrative limbo; trapped in the airtight mold of their coming-of-age avatars , they release no light and they take none in .
it sets a pace , keeps it up for the whole time , and gives us a sense of danger and excitement , + a taste of life that special effects can 't give us .
given the similarities between the two films -- the muddled fight scenes , the occasional one-liners , the over-the-top violence , used to camouflage the narrative weaknesses -- this easily could have been titled rambo v .
once again anna faris manages to be the best thing in another not very good anna faris movie .
brendan fraser is one funny , mixed-up guy . and as ms . lucifer , the new scourge of fraser 's life , elizabeth hurley crackles with sexy sarcasm .
an endless parade of melodrama blind with rage and completely irrational .
it 's hard to believe , at the culmination of 42 years and nine movies , that the last three would be essentially improvisational exercises by all directors concerned .
this is a film that abounds in smart touches .
the subjective camera gimmick wears thin after a while . montgomery is too light for marlowe .
. . .a fast-paced timewaster for those viewers undemanding enough not to care about plot , character , or logic .
wonderful scenery , great performances and a superb story .
well-made and creepy , but may have missed its calling as a short film .
at times tamahori 's visuals feel a bit too polished and refined , which gives the film a glossy veneer that is at odds with the atrocities on-screen
the rewarding western elements transition smoothly into the world of horror , like the sun moving behind a cloud . and yeah , things get dark and startlingly violent .
steven soderbergh 's superb (and supposedly final) film offers twists and intrigue in its dark examination of prescription medication .
it won 't be to everyone 's taste , but perky though it is not , it 's a great piece of film-making .
. . .an agreeable comedy that benefits substantially from hughes ' undeniable gift for seamlessly blending laughs with drama .
robert pattinson finally shakes off that twilight shame with this tense , foul-mouthed and ironically-titled character/crime drama .
practically all ominous establishing shots , yet it can be an incredibly suspenseful watch .
this is a movie with the excitement of a cavalry charge .
[simon] pegg 's goofy charm is on overdrive , elevating this silly comedy where the best scenes are between neil and his talking dog dennis (voiced by the late robin williams) .
no doubt the awards hype around the film will get people into cinemas but it doesn 't warrant the attention considering payne 's previous work and clooney has put in much better performances .
despite its pumped-up admiration for our troops and some scenes that spurt adrenaline like a fire hose , this sort-of-thriller about a bomb squad working in 2004 is stretched both timewise and for plausibility .
sunshine belongs to that select group of science-fiction films that care more about the science than the fiction .
ned dennehy 's tattoo-covered riktor is a mirthfully mercurial villain , while the film gently satirises our addiction not just to our electronic devices , but to the low voyeuristic pleasures of schadenfreude and ultraviolence .
working with the superb cinematographer jolanta dylewska , holland draws on the restricted light and vertiginous space to achieve immersive , tactile imagery that is appalling and unforgettable .
a chase picture for 12-year-olds .
there is a surprising lack of conflict in the film that allows its sincerity to come through without veering into self-importance . director dave mccary tells the film with little cynicism .
non-stop is an engaging mystery filled with thrills that 's sure to keep you guessing with every twist and turn of the story .
horrendous sequel to a shameless rip-off . not even "fun-bad ." well , maybe a little .
a ripping good yarn .
the presence of robert twilight pattinson in the cast of little ashes might generate more interest in this insubstantial drama than its meagre merits warrant .
a larky if sketchily schematic attempt to see if the self-adoring dj has the chops to carry his own feature film .
while this film fits squarely into soderbergh 's recurrent goal of ignoring audience interest when possible , that 's the only area in which it can be considered a success .
it belatedly reveals itself to be a meditation on the different kinds of loneliness , presenting isolation as a form of social stage fright .
. . . striking thriller .
there 's at least one better film on the topic - gallipoli - but the water diviner has its moments , even if its grasp of reality is all wet .
[a] flat and flimsy premise deserving of an immediate pink slip . the monotonous like a boss drags out its cockeyed comedic conflict with all the originality and imagination of cherry-colored lip gloss .
. . .while the film is seriously overlong , there are enough elements here to hold the interest of even the most impatient viewer .
little more than a soft-core snuff film
it 's cathartic , and moving , without any of the usual obvious contrivances or manipulations .
questionable style aside , it does what it sets out to do -- entertain .
this was a film worth making and its mere existence does honour to an extraordinary life . we 're better with it than without it .
hamm 's charm works well playing a debonair scoundrel on television but in this bland , family friendly offering , it 's a resource that 's quickly drained .
the funniest sex comedy you 're likely to see this year , as well as an incredibly poignant film .
a hard-drinking ex-veteran and single dad -- named adam in this more rugged than usual faith-based film -- teams up with a few neighbors to rain hell on dealers he blames for his sister 's death by drugs .
if the first film tapped into the chemical generation , t2 deals with our addiction to nostalgia . . . . a marvellous sequel .
the '70s tv show taxi had it down better , with better wit and cohesion .
i want to hug this movie .
a johnny cash biopic equally packed with music and frustrated love , walk the line goes from compelling to enthralling .
sometimes fassbender 's face is rigid with tension . elsewhere he 's loosey goosey . what 's uncanny is that despite no prosthetics being used he never looks like himself .
entertaining but only mildly amusing .
the first movie created wonderful characters , well worth caring about , but its sequel certainly didn 't . how could they have gone so wrong ?
incrivelmente eficaz , este suspense mantém um clima de tensão e claustrofobia constante e ainda tem o mérito de investir em um elenco exclusivamente feminino .
was biosphere 2 scientific adventure or eco-entertainment ? this is a gripping portrait of the billionaire 's folly/performance-art project , a hippie sf soap opera with unsettling resonance for today .
"the keen fan ," scott has said , "will recognise strands of alien 's dna ." the keen fan will be regularly concussed by these strands .
takes the other side of the bullied high-school outcast story and shows us a teen who discovers the fun of belonging .
delivering a powerful performance , michael caine embodies the wistfully cynical , vulnerable journalist/narrator .
giddy wirework and occasional flurries of poor 3d don 't come to the rescue of a turgid , anti-climactic plot in yuen woo-ping 's chop-socky extravaganza . . .
compelling but uneven drama .
it is grown-up , respectable and historical , perfectly competently made , lots of accents and period dressing-up . . . and just the tiniest bit dull .
while respire is initially an excellent portrait of a friendship taken to extremes , it fumbles when it becomes a full-on melodrama .
i can think of five things that are more torturous than what the victims endure in saw iv . . .
while the depression-era angst of the original is gone it 's replaced by attitude and heart .
an elegant miniature , rama burshtein 's "fill the void" labors under a narrative inevitability , but it 's artful work nonetheless .
nothing more than a nostalgia trip for people my age who remember seeing it in theatres and , because we were twelve , thinking it was hilarious .
joel and ethan coen have created an excellent film that intelligent audiences should really appreciate .
a hit-and-miss comedy , but mccarthy leads a game cast through several memorable moments .
significant performances from carrey and especially winslet highlight charlie kaufman 's latest brain tease , which might have worked a little better with concept set to medium .
a patently silly , uninteresting thriller that 's devoid of surprises .
plodding , puffed-up kitsch mistaking itself for profound psycho noir that the source material won 't support .
the murphy/wilson danger-with-laughs duo never achieves the cool , hip , bantering momentum of cosby/culp .
a thoroughly pleasurable emotional thrill ride that is , in its own way , as satisfying as watching arnold hang from the wing of a speeding jet .
jordan , true to form , moves fluidly between past and present toward an archly frenetic finale .
10 cloverfield lane is a fun and frightening blend of horror , suspense and science fiction that keeps twisting and turning right up to the final credits .
okja combines the holistic man-and-nature themes of a studio ghibli animation with the alarming food-industry revelations of cowspiracy: the sustainability secret .
though certainly a cut above the majority of its straight-to-video horror brethren , rest stop is ultimately undone by the inclusion of several questionable elements . . .
joy division fans have already embraced control , a film biography of short-lived lead singer ian curtis . those of us who didn 't follow the 1970s english band or the post-punk scene around it may feel less invested .
michell finds a way of filming the balloon accident in such an unnerving manner that it hints at the psychological torrents that will ripple through the narrative from thereon
. . . a decent action film , far superior to the awful terminator 3 , but it isn 't close to the quality provided by james cameron 's original or t2 .
as a musical piece , it is . . .able to convey mixed emotions within a very dissonant setting . but the film that goes along with it has a harder time selling its sense of self .
there is something quaint about watching the two stars take in the beautiful greek landscape and ingest meal after delicious meal , a reminder of what life was like pre-covid-19 .
may be predictable and silly , but it 's never dull .
prisoners is cruel and unusual punishment .
there 's a certain fun factor in the comedy-of-errors part of the venture
what really compromises the impact of taking lives is that the 'surprise ' about the identity of the madman is a foregone conclusion .
at once both hysterical and stomach turning , morgan spurlock 's documentary about living on fast food is a poignant achievement .
engrossing and often surprising but i 'm still bewildered why it triumphed over better foreign films at the academy awards .
a few minor changes and another strong , rounded performance by josh brolin helps spike lee 's remake overcome some of the problems inherent in revisiting known source material .
sometimes a remake can be better than the original . this doesn 't happen very often , but . . .thus it is with bret ratner 's remake of michael mann 's "manhunter ."
cruise 's inexhaustible appetite for creating wow-worthy stunts and action-packed set-pieces doesn 't disappoint .
alfonso cuarón has made a truly inspiring , heartening and utterly devastating film . an absolute masterpiece .
the complexities of the script , while clever , will likely fly over the heads of most within its target demographic .
a couple of good jolts , a pair of decent jokes . that 's it .
a sophisticated , elegant-looking film shot in distinctive , wide-ranging l .a . locales , but its real terrain is the human heart , explored with compassion and respect .
gloria bell is a spellbinding treasure .
almost all of the surfing footage is beautiful stuff , though you 'll likely want to see even more .
its cute story and its adorable lead , hilary duff as lizzie , will eventually win you over .
it may not scale the heights of the best recent romanian films (4 months , 3 weeks & 2 days , the death of mr lazarescu) but boogie is still a bittersweet character study .
a loudly inconsistent work that ranges from terrible to hilarious to , finally , pretty good .
. . .a stirring , emotionally wrenching drama that more than lives up to its source material . . .
by laminating walls ' story with a hollywood sheen , the narrative climaxes in an artificial and contrived manner .
a middling movie , an admirable effort that looks much better than star wars: the clone wars but won 't incite similar battles , pro or con .
dire and unsettling , it 's ultimately disappointing .
. . . never quite reaches the breathlessly mediocre heights of its predecessor , demon knight .
the 3d doesn 't add a lot to the narrative , but it 's still an exciting adventure into the mesmerizing world of dinosaurs and humanity 's godlike addiction to reviving the past .
okay , but nothing great .
goofy , outlandish and exhilarating .
a picture of unpleasant people treating each other poorly that comes across as buoyant and frankly joyful at times .
fans of comedies like legally blonde and mean girls should get a kick out of anna faris ' amusing starring vehicle , even if this one isn 't quite as sly or slickly produced .
incredible performances from the cast , but detachment is perhaps just too pretentiously depressing for its own good .
existenz keeps you guessing throughout , but this eventually becomes tiresome .
a gorgeous re-imagining , bringing to life the specific beauty and charm of the fairy tale . but it 's also rather hollow , doing little to add its own spin .
the eclectic soundtrack works in its favour and should appeal to a young audience , some of whom may treasure its sincere message about embracing your individuality .
its meta take on its own existence and that of other superhero films make it smarter than many of its targets .
sizzling with emotional undertones , the film is held back only by a lack of urgent pacing .
the release of each sequel is becoming an event , so it 's particularly great to see before midnight not only meeting expectations but raising the bar .
alita may be a cgi character , but her presence is magnetic .
there 's also not much in the way of lightness or humour in these kinds of films .
a confusing rehash of batman , indiana jones and james bond movies .
even donny osmond 's sparkling teeth seem a little dim compared with the unsullied gleam the movie presents as real life .
the atmospherics are in place , and the filmmakers catch the essence of lovecraft 's expansive horror with efficiency . the film is entertaining without attaining greatness .
this train wreck is nasty and mean without making any coherent point .
the only thing that elevates iris to the feature-film playing field is its acting talent , all of whom deliver touching , memorable performances .
wisely focusing on four key cases , the fight is a worthy attempt to document the aclu 's seemingly endless struggle to challenge the many constitutional violations of the trump administration .
this is romeo and juliet with a happy ending -- which can 't have been easy . asbury does a good job of unifying the whole and preserving the english humour .
quirky , mature hipster comedy is a bit too soggy .
probably it would have made a much better "twilight zone" episode at one-third of the length , but there 's enough good , solid genre work here to make it worthwhile .
an outstanding documentary that gives you an inside look into one of the greatest performers of all time . the only thing missing was a performance of "dirty diana ."
. . .a hard-driving horror film , that stays absolutely true to the premise . . .
rian johnson 's flashy cinematic stunt grafts the hard-boiled argot of dashiell hammett onto an upscale southern california high school .
the writing of first reformed is audacious . it is unusual - and even complicated - to connect the church or some institution of faith with the thriller . [full review in spanish]
madame aspires to more than it delivers but the film 's failure to highlight its only worthwhile character makes it feel cluttered with irrelevant and at times annoying material .
a sickeningly elegant , brutally ephemeral and devastatingly nuanced moral tale .
noomi rapace delivers a solid performance in this allegorical , torture-heavy horror movie .
i appreciate what almodovar was trying to do , but this comedy is just too broad for its own good .
they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we don 't avert our eyes for a moment .
who needs 3-d ? the blu-ray avatar jumps off the small screen until the director 's clunky moralizing takes over .
maleficent changes the story you know , there is simply no getting around that . it also manages to give us a spiteful but well-rounded villain to understand .
runaway train is a reminder that the great adventures are great because they happen to people we care about .
in doing away with manners , hanson 's hardboiled detective stories craft a more hard-hitting picture of the time than any filmmaker who worked in the 1950s could have dreamed
a thought-provoking and ethically-charged documentary about the apple computer entrepreneur .
makes about as much sense as the whispering trees in "the happening ."
it 's a tense and engaging thriller with some big ideas , only some of which it is able to carry .
a forgettable fist-flinging fable that 's as ridiculously raucous as it is relevant . swayze flexes his movie muscles needlessly in this dingy and disjointed drama
while it may be complicated for the characters , it 's a simple formula for light movie entertainment .
like everything by korean auteur park chan-wook , the handmaiden is meticulously controlled in form and bonkers-crazy in content . that 's a heady combo .
nicholas sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences . they amount to nothing more than romance novels , and not even good ones .
the third round of the bellas is basically a bland , very-occasionally-bubbling-to-the-surface , not-enough-laughs comedy .
spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units .
winterbottom keeps thompson 's bleakness intact , leaving us little to engage with . but the film has an earth beauty and is a haunting look at the dark side of being human .
the effect of mezzogiorno 's quiet acting is similar to people who whisper all the time , forcing you to lean closer to hear what they 're saying .
até mesmo o tom estabelecido pelo diretor estreante rupert sanders expõe a confusão dos realizadores com relação ao próprio material .
a very unpleasant movie .
this is not only the best movie ever made about dreams , it is also one of the best films of 2010 , and certainly one of the most entertaining pictures i 've seen in a decade .
wright and co . have produced another excellent comedy that , although it falls a little short of their previous two films , still delivers all the laughs that we 've come to expect from the trio .
a colourful , but turgid coming-of-age story masquerading as a thriller .
denis villeneuve takes on the mexican drug trade in this stern , robust , abandon-hope-all-ye-who-enter thriller .
chalk this up with the godfather part ii and the empire strikes back as one of the few sequels that 's better than the original .
"palo alto" doesn 't chart any new ground , but its derivativeness isn 't as grating as it should be .
. . .benefits substantially from keaton 's almost unreasonably charismatic turn as the title character . . .
kaurismki clearly knows this is a fantasy , and it 's a perfectly pleasant one at that .
corny action scenes and borderline-hilarious direction by isaac florentine mark the film as an obvious straight-to-video item that somehow took a wrong turn into a movie theater .
he spent 28 years in prison and this is what he gets ?
where the original was slight but sweet , the remake is depressingly superficial and cynical .
chazelle 's film , with its unfettered embrace of the imperfect , creates nothing less than a vital symphony of the human condition .
merchant deserves ample credit for juggling family emotion , the outlaw spirit of a "fake" sport , and the continuing message that appearances don 't always tell the entire story in any walk of life .
though yimou never achieves the romance of ang lee 's dabble in martial arts , he reaches new heights of spectacle with the combat .
it simply takes all the things you 've seen in other wedding movies and recycles them , all while pretending you 're dumb enough not to notice .
greengrass winds up mythologizing the actions of the passengers aboard united 93 , which isn 't entirely fair to them or to us , the viewer .
southern whimsy , when handled delicately , can produce a precious jewel a la junebug . in less skillful hands , it can be merely precious .
. . . as invigorating as a year in the airy , earthy english country .
arrival is one of the best movies of the year , a moving , gripping film with startling twists and imagery . it deserves serious treatment as a work of art .
an impossibly enjoyable live-action cartoon that plays on our real-life anxieties about vengeful cadres of foreign radicals blowing up people - and places .
jarmusch concocts a comedic anthology that 's calculated , arbitrary and inconsistent -- and so hilarious when it works that you 'll forget any regrets before the last cup is downed .
sliding doors deserves points for being original .
the coens have found the perfect source material to continue their dominance of the crime genre while making a second viewing an absolute must to appreciate all the voices involved .
i 'm surprised that the red herring isn 't extinct yet . it 's almost as if the makers of this film fished them all out of the sea and put them in this film
this is for those who like their political thrillers far-fetched , far-reaching and filled with pretty people .
mr kipling would be exceedingly pleased .
hostel: part ii fails in what amounts to its only distinct purpose: to smugly push the envelope of depravity farther than anyone else .
. . .a series of increasingly alarmed faces looking at papers and computer screens .
sure , biosphere 2 was a little silly , and it may not have worked out . but what did you do to try to save the planet today ?
. . .this film plays like a talented cover band 's version of your favorite song .
engaging enough to watch , and a fair measure better than [hallstrm 's] ridiculously overrated last work , chocolat .
most of the non-leads are underdrawn but laughs keep coming , only just bouncing this up from three stars to four .
ready player one is first and foremost an action adventure movie , and spielberg 's filmmaking instincts wisely sense that audiences will be fascinated by the rich and relentlessly shape-shifting world of oasis above all else .
great fun western
the hallow starts off well , establishing itself as a tense and atmospheric low-budget horror , with its foreboding milieu instilling immediate unease . . . but it 's nowhere near as effective as it promised to be .
this isn 't the cinema 's last word on london , but it will silence competitors for a few years to come .
this magnificent film by mizoguchi amazes me with its enriching formalism . [full review in spanish]
filmmaker bong does a superb job of immediately drawing the viewer into the deliberately-paced proceedings . . .
honestly ? you could do a lot worse this winter , and you probably already have .
the limits of control gives off the scent of a thriller but the general odour of an art movie purposefully going nowhere .
if you 're looking for something to watch to make you feel like the world will get better and that there 's hope , watch becoming .
it is a measure of nicholas martin 's fine script that he introduces us to florence 's marriage slowly , recognising it as almost a character in its own right with many a layer to be peeled back .
enjoyable character study from writer-director noah baumbach that makes up for its relative lack of plot with a superbly written script and terrific performances from ben stiller , greta gerwig and rhys ifans .
like the best fairy tales , "valerie" is voluptuously suggestive , a bit dangerous , and perfectly legible on its own subterranean terms .
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .
melissa mccarthy keeping pace in foot chases with actors who spend the better portion of their lives in a gym is about as funny as it gets , unless you count the antonymous editing of the action sequences .
you long for all this combined talent to be in the service of something more deserving than a retread of a story that has lost the edge it had 33 years ago .
watchable mockumentary with strong performances , but it 's not as funny as it should have been and is ultimately both depressing and uncomfortable to sit through .
the only ending that i can think of that these characters deserve would be to have the guys from funny games arrive at the cabin to inquire about the availability of some eggs .
scorsese 's first masterpiece is still gripping .
bohemian rhapsody , an eight-year abomination in the making . . .cannot claim to have achieved even wiki-movie status .
it is not often creative ambition and actual execution rise together to such atmospheric heights .
a meaty narrative with plenty of depth , entertaining characters brought to life by well-cast actors , and fight scenes that number among some of the best in the x-franchise .
you 'll cackle at christine baranski 's crackling dialogue , cry when meryl sings 'my love , my life ' , and when all is said and done you might even be tempted to go again .
there are ups and downs to international terrorism as a career and carlos lays them out very fairly .
the whole movie feels filmed through the wrong end of a stereopticon: stiff , fascinating , riddled with secrets it doesn 't care to divulge .
the plot is predictable , to be sure , but it 's fun to follow along . . . highly enjoyable no matter what one 's taste in music or dance .
yields more satisfaction than complaints .
subtexts aside , hounds of love is also an expert exercise in suspense , taut as the wire of a hills hoist .
invincible is part the rookie , part rocky and all heart .
it won 't change your life but brothers is still a sombre , thoughtprovoking movie and worth a look if all that you 're after is a slice of well acted , serious , character driven drama .
in many ways , the hurricane heist 's lack of self-awareness regarding just how dated it feels plays to its advantage .
donnie yen returns to contemporary action thrillers in a so-so undercover thriller with some fantastic action scenes . . .
when andy warhol opined that "in the future , everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes ," he forgot to mention that even those that never achieve fame will still get kid-glove documentaries made about them .
an abundance of above-average scares ultimately makes the grudge 's portrait of contagious anger , violence , and death creepily unsettling .
yawn .
' . . .the 2nd best paris hilton film i 've seen this year . '
a fun , fanciful film - not for the ages , but never outstays its welcome .
it feels more like an extended saturday night live-meets-funnyordie .com castoff than an actual comedic commentary on american politics .
while the rigid framing and wispy plot create an unfortunate inertia , they also magnify the occasional whimsical moment . . .
it moves quickly and avoids the bloated running time that has plagued many of these films , it has some nice bits of humor sprinkled throughout and , most importantly , the strong and entertaining brie larson performance .
most of delhi belly raises a smile , (a few guffaws can be had as well) , even if you feel like holding your nose through it .
guns akimbo is a force to be reckoned with and is a film that can confidently stand alongside early peter jackson or mark l . lester . run to see this wild , insane ride .
new "carrie" stands on its own
with a small handful of musical numbers and a likable hero in the form of ted , you can do much worse than this when it comes to a family friendly feature .
as a recent comedy goes , keanu is above average and works on many levels . the story was cute and the cat(s) even cuter - not to mention pretty good at acting .
there is a genuine emotional resonance to furious 7 that is painfully real .
a decent us ensemble cast includes regulars from curb your enthusiasm and , though the pacing is too slack , some silly one-liners help to make up for it .
if the film lacks a formidable emotional impact , that 's partly by design .
a lot of what makes this movie work is the performance of maisie williams . she brings life , vim , and vigor to what could have just been a cliche .
learning to live beyond grief is the heart of the story and the performances bring out that premise beautifully .
am i the only person alive that realizes this movie blows ? bill murray is a standout , nonetheless .
. . . ken loach 's the wind that shakes the barley may be the most powerful look yet at the guerrilla-styled irish rebellion against occupying british forces in 1920-22 .
another triumph .
searching has added a very special ingredient - good acting . john cho is utterly convincing in the role of harrowed dad and widower .
makes you wonder , just a little , what it was about blow that made it a 'go ' project .
unfortunately , ambition , ambiguity and scale prevent big bad wolves from complete success .
the subject certainly isn 't dated , but the film 's dull post-john hughes , sub-judd apatow style of comedy is like a just-buried time capsule full of accumulated clichs .
i won 't go so far as to state it 's battlefield earth for the clearasil crowd , but it 's clearly a turkey no matter how it 's sliced up .
the movie essentially becomes little more than cool set pieces . . . jammed together and interspersed with underdeveloped family-strife scenes .
for the usually great robert altman , this is a terribly disappointing directing effort .
award-winning director ang lee assembles a collection of effective scenes in this serious effort , but it also several moments that don 't really work; in the end , it doesn 't seem to add up to much .
informs and entertains in equal measure . . .not only proves thoroughly family friendly , but it 's that rare moviegoing option likely to please everyone in any group .
a picture made by artists who have some imagination wrestling with a screenplay by professional hand-crankers lowell ganz and babaloo mandel that doesn 't have any .
syly silly , subversively stupid - which is exactly what you 'd expect .
as one of this generations greatest actors , two time oscar winner day-lewis is a shoo-in for a chance at a third trophy .
an eerie and austere film charting the nightmarish response of the french sculptress to her imprisonment in an asylum .
on its own , it seems fine; just don 't compare it to its capable siblings .
avoids many of the pitfalls of the original by setting low goals and aiming for wholly generic , monster-horror mediocrity .
this misbegotten adaptation of oscar wildes 1892 comedy lady windermeres fan lacks wilde 's high-toned repartee .
the animation itself , while stylized , is fairly cheap and drab-looking on the big screen . all of those are merely adult complaints and minor ones compared to the good aspects of hey arnold! .
crystal , midler and tomei make a perfect combination for this funny but heartwarming family film
lane 's vibrant performance is as vital to this amusing saga as a bottle of good chianti to a heaping plate of pasta .
it 's too bad creadon breezes through potential solutions to the problem and ends his film with what basically amounts to a rock the vote ad .
this is hypnotic , emotionally wrenching filmmaking .
[sundance 2016] "life , animated" is joyous and touching in equal measure , a documentary about a young autistic man , owen suskind , whose love of disney movies held the key to a life-changing communication breakthrough .
it 's a watchable , if hardly terrific , rendering of an innovative broadway landmark .
politics and mass communication are the volatile subjects of rachel boynton 's information-packed documentary .
the audience is certainly offered plenty of beautiful bone structure featured in languid close-ups of the two leads , along with jewel-like , memorable moments of acting prowess from the older actors .
as baumbach previously demonstrated with greenberg and margot at the wedding , he specialises in stinging , astringent comedy: the kind that seeps into the failures of a character like lemon juice into a cut .
there 's nary a hint of the original troll dolls ' disconcerting unearthliness in this utterly tame although vibrantly animated feature from dreamworks animation .
for all its flaws , rosenstrasse is a welcome reminder that humans are capable of valor and generosity in the worst of times .
it seems destined for a hollywood remake , which is likely to be more polished but not nearly as weirdly charming .
after so much emotional dishonesty inherent in sundance films like hello i must be going and celeste & jesse forever , save the date had a welcome air of truth about it .
if you like your thrillers grim and violent , then shot caller certainly delivers the goods .
tthis one comes off as an amateurish misstep due to unoriginal storytelling from fledgling screenwriters michael and shawn rasmussen .
in the end , what i appreciated most was the unpredictability of it all .
von donnersmarck , who brilliantly depicted government surveillance in east berlin before the fall of the wall in his earlier german film , astonishingly can 't even find a way to make interpol 's spying interesting here .
by turns boring and bizarre , although diesel still has some presence .
sex and the city , which feels like a behind-numbing six episodes strung clumsily together , could be much fun in the hands of a veteran director .
getaway is pretty much a 90-minute car chase . that 's it .
dentistry in the renaissance could not have been more painful than watching this .
a typically erratic sacha baron cohen comedy . . .
a feast for the eyes and ears that entertains without asking for anything in return .
horrible bosses is without question the funniest movie released so far this year , and the slyest raunch-com to date .
. . . an imaginative and charming movie for the upcoming holiday season .
there 's strikingly little new or fresh about the decaying corpse that is [rec] 3 .
it 's a fascinating snapshot of indian culture in the 1930s , and a cautionary tale about the dangers of an inflated opinion of self-worth .
jfk as most remember him . fine performance by robertson .
a forgiving nature and lots of stamina is needed for this no-holds-barred hedonistic ride into the roman orgy-style excesses of the 1990s ' financial world
the film is about finding your inner child and acceptance and maturing into something greater . this is what gives me hope for the inevitable sequel .
'walking on sunshine ' is casting a dark cloud over the movies .
for a matchup between two of the most fearsome creatures in moviemaking history , this movie is surprisingly tame .
a crime-thriller that resonates with the modern state of america .
ironically , middle school 's message is about encouraging kids and grown-ups to think outside the box and yet , the filmmakers themselves do precisely the opposite .
feels desperately overscripted and straight out of an early seventies tv movie of the week .
burn does a lot for a lark , but a lark it is nonetheless , and perfectly welcome as long as the coens bring back their ambition next time around .
although branagh delivers a film that 's reasonably watchable , the not-so-mysterious truth is that "murder on the orient express" didn 't need to be remade .
the laugh to wince factor is about five to two in favor of winces .
cosmo jarvis punches above his weight in the film that announces his arrival as a cinematic force to be reckoned with
shyamalan gets his chutzpah , if not his mojo back with this suspense-free and indulgent ego trip
there is really something for everyone in this movie .
there 's much to love , and much to loathe about joe wright 's new adaptation of anna karenina .
tender , original and moving .
a fascinating character study that does more for kidman than it does for the genre . but then , on this kind of form , she deserves it .
[marlene dietrich] was never better than she is here .
moves incessantly between the sublime and the ridiculous . [full review in spanish]
for first-time director michael greenspan , wrecked stands as a future calling card to show just how much intrigue and audience involvement he can rile up with such a minimalist plot .
an involving , lyrical , and visually beautiful cinematic bildungsroman .
in this exciting , explosive shoot 'em up , unfortunately , character complexity has become secondary to continual conflict - too much hardware , too little heart .
bateman handles the edgy material with confidence and gets excellent performances from co-stars kathryn hahn , allison janney and philip baker hall , and particularly from rohan chand .
ticket buyers older than 8 should simply close their eyes and ponder a more stimulating concept: beverly hills cujo .
the film 's chief pleasure comes from fighting the desire to believe at any given point that the hero is finally being sincere , that now we are seeing the real man and his real plan .
a pair of fine performances from its lead actors makes the over churned narrative a bit more palatable , but the script from first time scribe micah ranum feels as overstuffed as it is derivative .
a decent zombie film
crayton robey 's documentary is a time capsule of the burgeoning gay rights era . it has poignant moments that sneak up on you . and sometimes , well , it 's just trashy fun .
spanning a year beginning in the summer of 1984 , the witnesses offers the considerable satisfaction of a beautifully acted ensemble piece built on the foundation of a serious subject%u2014the dawn of the aids crisis%u2014handled just so .
those who follow the "so bad it 's good" school of thought will probably love it -- anyone else should avoid .
american honey will frustrate some but as a time capsule and ode to youthful energy , it 's priceless .
. . .a well-intentioned yet hopelessly inert piece of work .
quite a few pounds of fat could have been cut from this film , but it 's a remarkable tale .
smart , swift and scary as hell .
a riveting character piece which will stir the soul upon completion .
no fancy footwork . no chewing the scenery . meat and potatoes , you could say , but it 's thoughtful and moving .
a frustrating experience , made more so by the seemingly self-referential moments in the film .
trade of innocents is as much a piece of social-justice campaigning as it is a work unto itself , an important fact to remember when considering its many flaws .
cleverly uses the familiar tropes of the biopic against itself to blur the lines between verifiable fact , elaboration and pure speculation
it would be a very hard-hearted person indeed who would not warm to the gentle charms of . . . this low-key , fondly personal look at one of life 's gifted but hardly world-famous personages .
it deserves to be seen and offers more real human emotion than most of the year 's would be box office busters .
wright keeps the cast and the film rigidly in line for such a wild ride , and it works .
makes you long for the parentless state of the martians the movie depicts , who kidnap a mother and inadvertently whisk up her little son during a mom-harvesting trip to earth .
as thrillers go , this is clumsy , cliche-ridden old stuff .
robin williams cae en el tipo de personaje que ha venido interpretando hasta el cansancio: el del hombre bueno que es todo emociones y que es capaz de llorar amargamente
as dramatically potent as a b-tier disney drama , into the white , while displaying instances of complexity , is mired by clich and melodrama .
there 's a mystery at the heart of "the song of names ," but it isn 't much of a mystery , and once it 's solved , the movie loses what little interest it has .
it doesn 't rewrite schindler 's list , but caro delivers enough compassionate hugs and kicks to the gut to make the story worthwhile .
the fascination of hype! is watching a bandwagon hurtling out of control , fueled not so much by those on board as those pushing it from behind .
see it for the beauty of the first hour , but after that , well -- don 't say you weren 't warned .
a lackluster sequel to the well-loved original .
the human brain is a marvellously suggestible organ .
wise , honest , breezy , witty and profound , a summer 's tale is an intellectually and emotionally rewarding date movie for sophisticated couples .
a spicy hot tortilla full of laughs , romance and one hell of a stunning leading lady . . .this year 's "risky business" . . .entertains thoroughly
this isn 't to say this is a bad movie , kids will enjoy they bright colors and the goofy characters . longtime fans will get a few chuckles and heartwarming moments . but it could have been better .
ultimately offers little satisfaction outside of the strong performances .
by the time the movie was over , i was in awe over the visionary success that i had just scene .
the john wick series turned into a video game so gradually we almost didn 't notice; insert 15 bucks to continue .
far-fetched and trite .
sci-fi thriller has peril and bloody violence .
though some of the action cinematography is stunning , and practicing snowboarders will love the sense of camaraderie established , it 's not riveting entertainment for the rest of us .
director devito has referred to this film as 'a cross between barney and pulp fiction . ' he wishes .
i was hoping for a rich double scoop that would leave me with a big satisfied smile on my face , what i got was a single scoop that was sorta flavorless .
in shoplifters , hirokazu kore-eda produces an emotional film that transports the audience into the confines of a claustrophobic , cluttered atmosphere; brimming with warmth as he introduces a family of loveable criminals
aliens in the attic is simply your standard issue , paint-by-numbers family film likely to be most successful with smaller children .
hoffman has a gentle hand with his ancient cast and a doting eye for the english country house .
fuqua lights the fuse on the summer blockbuster season with an almighty , ground-shaking bang .
a quaintly uncomplicated romance that struggles to keep up with the quality of its acting .
it 's fresh . it 's novel . it 's original , challenging , fun , and "deep" all at the same time .
pleasant , especially on the design front , but a lack of narrative substance makes the whole a little too indulgently whimsical .
doesn 't measure up .
whatever film you 've imagined . . .is better than what the film actually is .
who wants to spend 90-odd minutes with a guy who can 't appreciate a single joy in his life ?
another successful and engaging episode in this long-running sci-fi saga .
all wan and whannell know is shock-and-awe tactics . they may shock , but there 's no awe .
badland is a good 30-45 minutes too long .
there 's nothing wrong with shall we dance ? exactly , except that it makes absolutely no sense .
after a while , the movie begins to lumber , and it never quite regains its legs . it fails , in any satisfactory way , to evolve .
istvan szabo uses his compositions-of-depth as a sort of excavation of the epistemological quandaries haunting the post-second world war world .
a doughily inexpressive will ferrell extinguishes any flicker of originality in one of the worst performances of his career .
stop me if you think you 've heard this one before .
everyone has a different story . i found myself holding my breath listening to them talk . the story twists like a thriller .
instead of reinventing this genre , zhang opts to dazzle his audience with his assemblage of technical and aesthetic wonders .
examines the same themes as films like ordinary people and american beauty , for example . and both of those look clumsy and derivative in comparison!
jason bourne on tetrahydrocannabinol .
portman 's best performance ever in an engaging story of paranoia that works fantastically . [full review in spanish] .
if you thought she 's all that was all that , this will pass the time for you - but if you thought she 's all that was all that , well , so would practically any film .
the film veers off into that realm of unbelievability that i react against . but there is a certain fascination in watching cook strut his stuff (and boy does he strut) , and kate hudson is pleasant to watch .
shadow recruit isn 't awful , but it doesn 't possess the depth nor the thrills to join the ranks of bond , bourne , or even tv 's bauer .
[stamp] hasn 't had a role like this since his heyday in the '60s and he shows he has been overlooked far too long .
for what it is , it 's effective . but lost among the bloodlust is any sense of these characters as human beings .
an action thriller of alienation and broken dreams passed from generation to generation make this a thoroughly entertaining 140 minutes .
lauren cohan has real screen presence and looks capable of making the leap from tv to film , rarely an easy chasm to cross .
filled with moments of painful revelation , real comedy and emotional insight .
the idea is to humanize one of the most fearful monsters in the western crypt . but dracula untold goes way overboard , past domestication and into canonization .
an awkward and aggressively unfunny film .
mind-bending thriller is excessive and violent but artful .
sky high is not quite what it could have been , but its positive attributes manage to overcome the villainous forces of boredom and lameness .
the film 's subtle brand of cerebral terror cuts sharper and deeper than anything found in a more conventional horror movie .
talk about scary -- the entire last half of the flick is a spectral presence that can hardly be said to exist .
the creator of the original mad max trilogy has whipped up a gargantuan grunge symphony of vehicular mayhem that makes furious 7 look like curious george .
not even cameos by rob lowe as a copilot , chad everett as sally 's weston 's husband , or george kennedy as an airline passenger can rev up this plummeting plane wreck .
a perfect getaway is one of those very clever whodunits that keeps you guessing for quite awhile . but on the way home , as you replay its tricks , you may feel more conned than charmed .
the salt of the earth is too stagnant on its own terms . . .
there 's no story here . the film is all about the grisly , electric mayhem that ensues when these two guys hit the streets .
the lack of melodrama coupled with moments of quiet celebration make goodbye solo a more uplifting tale than one might expect with such a less-than-joyous premise .
there may well be a market for simple-minded , high-budget tales of christian redemption; if so , henry poole should do very well at the box office .
it may not be original , but it is tender and dramatically comical . [full review in spanish]
coogler has brought off something impressive here: he 's made one of the few halfway watchable marvel movies and returned the comic strip to the streets where it belongs .
excellent courtroom drama .
an oddball endeavor that doesn 't entirely work . . .
by its very nature , the resulting film is severely compromised , but still rip-roaring , unpretentious entertainment .
the movie is drenched in atmosphere and dread , as we 'd expect from schrader , but it also has spiritual weight and texture , boldly confronting the possibility that satan may be active in the world .
to his credit , campy director adam shankman knows that his source material is a joke - but it 's a joke at the expense of musical history .
the highest praise i can bestow upon the kid who would be king is to say that it reminds me of the movies i loved when i was a kid myself .
it 's refreshing to see a documentary about a normal grown-up who is struggling with problems of life and love , just as so many invisible others do .
a tender and perceptive film .
it 's a respectful and respectable version of the story , albeit just a wee bit overlong .
if the actors don 't appear interested , then an adult audience can 't be expected to follow suit .
[an] impeccable existential jewel . [full review in spanish]
no arnold , no personality .
an excuse for a spectacular series of costume and hair changes , not-so-spectacular stunts and a parade of pointless celebrity cameos .
the ultimate destination creates the opportunity for penn to draw up a summation for his protagonist 's journey , and it 's a moral that should satisfy those viewers looking for meaning and order .
at two and a half hours , sex 2 -- like its predecessor -- is a long sit in the shallows , the equivalent of five half-hour episodes strung together .
interstellar is beautiful , dazzling and astonishingly loud , but , alas , it is remains something of a mess at the level of the script
a snappy , inventive comedy with chevy chase .
"safety not guaranteed" is eccentric enough to get mistaken for an uplifting fantasy , but it 's plaza who belongs in the penthouse .
nailbiting and poignant .
if you 're a fan of hers you 'll be able to find some enjoyment in this movie , but not as much as she seems to be having while making them .
an honest and unflinching character-driven drama that takes a turn into full-blown horror territory once relic builds towards its final moments , and it does so with the greatest of ease .
é bom ver o cinema cumprindo uma velha função que , às vezes , é esquecida: levar o espectador a refletir sobre si mesmo e sobre a sociedade em que vive .
little boy; mountain with secret; and in one scene 100 naked santa clauses running around like panicked reindeer . they order these yuletides differently in lapland .
this thunderously noisy celebration of the hasbro toy ticks all the right boxes with the fanboys . . .the rest of us might suffer metal fatigue .
the doggie antics generate a few chuckles , but it 's a sign of the film 's inefficiency that the biggest laugh comes from a sight gag involving a chimp and a cattle prod .
if you spent 86 minutes crawling through a snowbank while clad only in a bathing suit , it would probably be a more rewarding experience than sitting through norm of the north .
the uneven thing [here] is john hillcoat 's direction: a tense , sustained journey through an apartment while lined up behind a bulletproof shield alternating with indulgent zooms and cuts depicting local color .
comparing this to the summer 's biggest , most bloated movie about malevolent robots , 9 is about twice as enjoyable with half the length .
an apparently simple movie that demands and rewards a deeper look .
mad detective doesn 't always make sense , and you cannot always tell what is real and what is imaginary , but viewers will be having too much zonked-out fun to care .
only occasionally funny but mainly awkward with its quick and easy humour , i give it a year doesn 't deliver the new style of british romantic comedy that we were waiting for .
an immensely appealing documentary that enables us to empathize with five very different teenagers in their last year of high school in warsaw , indiana .
goes nowhere , furiously .
you want to close your eyes but can 't -- a sure sign the horror is working .
a riveting , wrenching , horrifying and beautifully told story .
it 's impossible to shake the impression that barnyard was written by idiots . why else would the male cows have udders ?
it 's both very funny and very scary , and never descends to the level of spoof .
packed with forgettable wisecracks , this is a very american brand of children 's entertainment , crass and overbearing but harmless .
an almost astonishingly misbegotten endeavor . . .
jean renoir is perhaps the greatest of all film directors . he is certainly the most lovable .
at the very worst an intriguing misfire , and often much better than that .
satanic horror films are always good for a laugh , and this one is no exception .
it is unquestionably overwrought , but it is a truly lovely film with a lot of emotion in it . the meaning of all that emotion is unfortunately still up for grabs .
bring a pair of earplugs , or a favorite symphony on a walkman , and enjoy the visuals . there is no excuse for a film with such stunning imagery to have such stunningly bad acting .
a kitchen sink comedy more shocking than funny and strictly recommended for rabid fans of the bottom-feeding franchise .
one moment we are watching these characters , the next - without quite noticing - we are inside them , walking about in their emotional landscapes .
like the art scene it documents , beautiful losers is chaotic , anarchic , rambling and populated by charismatic freaks with statement t-shirts , complicated haircuts and impossibly rare trainers .
a cinematic , melancholic love song to barcelona 's unrepresented communities , with uxbal as their totem .
there were times when i could see the brilliance of spielberg and there were other times where i felt like i was maybe expecting just a little bit more .
this film has little to recommend itself .
martin & orloff might have worked as a 10-minute sketch , but lawrence blume 's low-budget feature quickly wears thin .
unjaded and hopelessly smitten with the filmmaking process
is it a comedy ? or are they really trying to make a go at a horror film ? funny enough , it actually works as both .
true grit is the kind of rip-roaring western adventure movie that , like film musicals , have art and innocence that is now lost forever .
firth and blunt give life (and flawless american accents) to this restrained , and occasionally bland , road trip flick .
it will be remembered for its bone-breaking , blood-splattering , white-knuckle skirmish - not for its performances , characters , plot or dialogue . on this level , it works .
even if you don 't think [kissinger 's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch .
unfortunately , the answers to these questions turn out to be less involving than teplitzky 's methods in asking them .
an uninspiring , and wholly underwhelming piece of cinema
out of time takes its time getting going , but once it finally reaches cruising speed , it moves along nicely .
one of the cinema 's most stirring celebrations of married love and a portrayal of the 'good german ' in world war ii that is true , convincing and profoundly moving .

plays with scale in ways that allows it to feel like a big movie at times but it also has enough intimate moments to keep sight of the fact that it 's a character piece .
an oddly compelling stop action animation film with puppets which provides a glimpse into the meaning of life in the adventures of a group of urban dwellers .
it 's well made and involving , and bale is obviously committed to bringing this desperate character to life .
emotionally inert . and that is something that no film about sex and nazis must ever be .
filmmaker todd holland has infused the wizard with a very deliberate , very gentle sort of feel that mostly works . . .
for a voyeuristic medium , this tale of a voyeur does a poor job of prying into its own protagonist 's life .
works better as cinematic spectacle than as compassionate romantic drama . fortunately , their afterthought of a romance dampens but does not spoil the movie 's cumulatively handsome spell .
despite its flaws , this is a film that looks great , includes a memorable hopkins performance , and is well enough written to keep us thinking rather than latching onto stereotypes .
walker , of 2 fast 2 furious , is 2 flat 2 forgettable .
nothing short of pathetic .

it 's not very ambitious , but it 's funny .
too unsophisticated .
the rat-infested trenches of northern france are no place for a boy in the spring of 1918 . but that 's where second lieutenant raleigh naively requests to be sent .
anaconda is trying to be a jaws for the '90s , but , like last year 's the ghost and the darkness , it falls short in several key areas .
great fun - and certainly the best musical of the year so far .
there are scenes that were certainly fabricated for the movie , but the emotional truth behind them feels real .
rasoulof 's dissident return to filmmaking is ultimately little more than a sporadically searing , unfocused and listless treatise on the pervasive censorship enforced by the autocratic iranian government .
that , perhaps , is the genius of anomalisa: its ability to inspire pity for unpleasant puppets-and their puppeteers .
find yourself a small child and go - but be sure to stop for tea and biscuits after .
director scott wiper makes the critical mistake of copping attitude and a conscience about the inherent pitfalls of reality tv .
. . .this first half is essentially throat-clearing before the operatic finale . the pacing seems abrupt and rapid . . .
. . .i thoroughly checked for spiders under my pillow before i went to bed .
undertow conforms to many of the tropes of a formula thriller but , aided by an evocative philip glass score and tim orr 's beautifully naturalistic cinematography , it transcends the genre .
instead of permitting its characters to be developed naturally , simpatico manipulates them to fulfill the needs of its heavy-handed plot .
the film -- pinched from ghost in every relevant particular -- is pretty moderate .
romance meets neurology in this adam sandler-drew barrymore romance that only works when she 's on-screen .
you want the truth ? they don 't come much uglier than this .
not knowing what to expect , the battle between hudson and hatheway was fun to watch but i would not waste money to see it in theatres . wait for the rental!
this '90s flashback is strictly for the faithful .
it 's precisely the kind of tense fare that plays best to a crowded house , and benefits greatly from the direction of a filmmaker who knows how to tighten the screws on his squirming audience .
if it had been stillman 's swan song , a director could hardly hope to be prouder of such a strong exit .
incendiary writing - the epithets make you squirm in post-pc nervousness in your seat , or make you hear yourself (or your friends , enemies) in the mouths of these actors .
compelling but ueneven treasure-hunt tale has drinking , sex .
watching [the] tough , sarcastic holmes chase the many carrots the film dangles for him is the chief pleasure in this crafty tangle of little clues and tightly wound action .
. . .riveting , enormously resonant and impressively acted . . .
steven spielberg has delivered a perfect blockbuster for our nostalgia-driven times .
an uninspiring approximation of mandela 's life .
a seriously entertaining , original , visual mind warp .
it 's comfortably one of the worst films of the year so far .
stay away from this movie . dumb and dumberer is a wreck .
not the comedy i expected but instead a well acted but depressing film .
if you hate what the fast movies represent , this won 't win you over (try #5 or #7 for that) . if you love the fast movies , this won 't disappoint .
the 2001 of animation . it 's a sci-fi masterpiece . r2d2 hits the road . but it 's also no finding nemo . . .
the director of 'the witch ' returns , bringing us deep into the heart of pretentious art house cinema .
by emphasizing the heightened sound of bullets whizzing in air , then striking wood , windows and bodies , the movie presents an intense , almost immersive experience .
whenever bill murray is in a film , there 's always one simple rule . give him a decent set-up and you 've got yourself a classic .
this is the greatest film about hollywood ever put on celluloid by hollywood .
even if it can 't match its predecessor , the golden circle still offers enough lunatic fun to prove reasonably satisfying .
blades of glory is funny , and that 's all that matters .
a nerve-shredding two hours even with awareness of how it 's all destined to go down .
the no-holds-barred rowdiness of american pie makes it worth seeing .
a touching , poignant movie with a great performance by leto
. . .a superior comedy/drama that 's often much more profound than its marketing materials may have indicated .
expect a few tears of joy in the audience . and expect to see this film showing up on some lists of the year 's best films .
easily one of the very best of 2016 .
[most viewers] will be left wondering , between endless soundtrack-selling video montages , how a girl with such a wispy baby-girl voice got into a serious music program .
tim sutton 's experimental arrangement of the "one-hit-wonder" thematically explores the guilt , grief and sadness of wasted talent; the melancholic descent to normalcy .
it 's too long but there is a light touch to this often funny look back to old hollywood . fans of nice , gentle entertainment should enjoy it .
pride and prejudice and zombies is not a perfect movie , but it works very well as a vehicle of entertainment . [full review in spanish]
sour is not the word for it . the milk obtained from this money is positively rancid .
the film works well as a whole and is lively from start to finish .
"captain fantastic" leaves viewers with the cheering , deeply affecting image of a dad whose superpowers lie in simply doing the best that he can .
. . .an unfunny , aggressively desperate , and flat-out boring comedy . . .
simply one of the best , most fun movies of the year
settles too easily for an editing formula which alternates talking heads , too cursory performance footage and montages of headlines and photographs .
it 's impossible to overstate the importance of sex , lies , and videotape when it burst onto the scene in 1989 .
events veer from the apocalyptic (the near-extinction of america 's flowers) to the inexplicable (the finale is a parody of an 'airport ' movie) , all presented with a glib yada-yada sense of inconsequentiality .
along with great chemistry between all the characters and some solid action set-pieces , dora and the lost city of gold has buckets of charm and a plethora of great messages for the younger members of the audience .
its stage origins might be all too obvious , but the excellent ensemble cast makes it an enjoyable breeze , and the in-laws meeting scene is farce comedy at its best .
here is another kitschy kiddy fantasy about father christmas , witless , gaudy and hyperkinetic .
whatever problems some might have with its execution , it 's hard to argue against a film whose intent is to kindle youthful compassion for living things and inspire action to protect earth and its creatures .
williams absolutely nails sy 's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness .
as played by ben stiller , the character of greenberg fails to transcend his abhorrent exterior .
you cannot look away from him . the performance is so . . . strange .
there are so many wonderful characters and so much great music that ricki and the flash is bound to have audiences leaving with a happy tune on their mind .
a well-intentioned but obvious , often clumsy picture .
. . . comes apart at the seams , the victim of irreconcilable differences between vaughn 's schtick and the flimsy script .
for nearly three overwrought hours , beloved drags at a draining pace , intermittently introducing unfulfilled story arcs and false climaxes .
the first half of emelie is gripping , tense , and filled with unforgettable scenes and fantastic acting across the board . everything after the twist is the polar opposite , and also highlights unforgivable flaws
the replacements is a bad movie , but a likable one .
edged with cynicism and wit , tuschi 's film can 't hide its admiration - but real answers lurk tantalisingly out of reach .
youth-targeted , seductively supernatural and unevenly paced - with all the big-buzz blood lust , the shiver may seem a trifle anemic .
while hardly a revelation , it is a welcome return for the actor to the genre that made him famous .
an accomplished and tremendously engaging debut from israeli director dover kosashvili .
. . .can 't be denied as a landmark visceral experience , even if there are some solid reasons to resist it .
depicts the efforts of a russian jew to survive a nazi concentration camp with his creativity and chutzpah .
the film is lamentably short of narrative coherence .
"stormy monday" is about the way light falls on wet pavement stones , and about how a neon sign glows in a darkened doorway .
top acting honors go to ray liotta as gary figgis , a cokehead cop who just might be freddy 's only friend .
if nothing else , it 's now a revisitable , visually represented document of a very good show .
twilight this is not , and jennifer lawrence 's katniss everdeen ain 't bella lusting after edward . instead , you would imagine the flinty katniss driving a stake through edward 's pale , sentimental ass .
the 'burbs doesnit quite go the distance , but for most of its length it is a superbly inventive , insightful and funny black comedy .
by most standards , this would count as a moody and sophisticated thriller - but it just does not quite live up to the cronenberg promise .
without the rock this movie would be unwatchable . . .i think because i liked san andreas a lot more than i should have that i was hoping for that kind of fun . i didn 't get it .
always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action .
some may be turned off by how busy the film is , rushing from one set piece to the next without catching a breath .there 's no time to stop and sniff a golden flower .
what makes this elegy worth watching is the unfettered access to andrew , appachey and harley , teenagers who are dealing with a hardscrabble existence in which role models are nowhere in sight .
this is an entertaining game of tension and gore with a strong funny bone , all in a well-wrapped package clearly designed with surprising thought and artistic effort with a star-making performance for samara weaving .
dark blue world 's warm story and beautiful photography almost hits the mark , and it has a great ending .
sharp , smart , sophisticated and witty . trust us . this is no fake praise!"
there 's slow and then there 's ana lily amirpour 's "the bad batch ."
fantastical tale of the reptile that conquered the wild west .
there 's a whiff of "tv movie of the week" about this tale of one woman 's crusade against injustice , but , like the similarly themed erin brockovich , there 's also much to recommend it .
this low-level laffer seems set to bounce out of theatres in short order .
ridiculous , dark as hell , and more fun that you could possibly imagine , elle must be seen to be believed .
the tease of 50 gorgeous women fighting to the death has a classic grindhouse appeal , but raze is strictly a "be careful what you wish for" proposition .
once the significance of the title is revealed , it turns a good , promising film into a nearly great one .
the most remarkable thing about donahue 's work in this movie is that she is rarely seen on camera . she brings depth and emotional nuance to heather 's character through just her voicework and breathing .
d 'arienzo 's love of trite indie-movie signposts of comic quirkiness -- deadpan delivery , overly formal camerawork , characters delivering dialogue into the camera , stunt casting -- is ultimately regrettable .
herzog reveals the genius and madness of his best fiend klaus kinski .
director terry george tells this painful and complicated story well .
one of the few films this year that succeeds in amplifying the impact of actual events using the power , or distortion , of the camera .
like the calculatingly misleading title and most of full frontal , it 's little more than a tease , a private joke by a director winging it between more important jobs .
you 'll feel decadent enjoying it , but everything is so tasty , it would be foolish to object .
i 'd rather watch the kevin costner version a hundred times before enduring another viewing of this plodding , pointless medieval monstrosity .
from the hauntingly beautiful to the scary , pina bausch 's post-modern dance sparkles in 3d .
the grandmaster interweaves themes of ancient loyalty and modern betrayal around a narrative predicated upon the interplay between the differing schools , traditions and movements of myriad martial arts disciplines .
although the list is rather short , maybe vince vaughn should think about throwing in the towel when it comes to starring in movies that deal with some aspect of christmas .
escape from l .a . is too preposterous to be a good film . but in keeping with its title , it does provide a couple of hours of entertaining escapism .
i liked it in the same way i love watching big brother and every other stupid reality show on television .
drags in places and deosn 't even try for a true-to-life portrait of the great theatre entrepeneur but it 's shiny and big spectacle with impressive choreography .
it deserves all the kudos it can get for its representation of asian people (but) more than that it deserves to be seen because it 's a fun , well-made romance .
kids save the world from bloody aliens; language , violence .
michael caine , ben kingsley and a host of other brit thesps ham it up , hammer-style , but brad anderson 's baggy direction hampers any enjoyment .
the more you understand what 's really going on , the less you like it .
morrison likes to cite the japanese master filmmaker yasujiro ozu as an influence , and you can feel his guiding hand throughout this remarkable debut feature .
school of rock got high and watched harold and kumar , and the pick of destiny was the story told to the cops upon waking up in the drive thru .
everest is an engrossing cinema experience when it focuses on the intensity and drama of this real-life disaster , but its ultimate downfall is its unmanageable scope .
if we 're being honest , korine 's spring breakers is a better movie-going experience than it is an actual movie .
despite my better instincts , i thought this movie was pretty funny .
the strongest thing about this movie is the "this i have to see" factor . if only the story had the same kind of groove going as the effects .
despite its tiny canvas , duck season soars with all the profundity and inanity of teenage life; the tenderness , the isolation , and the doomed joy of its innocent irresponsibility .
laughter trumps logic here , and the laughs flow freely .
since lu depicts the punishing , unforgiving determination on both sides of the conflict , the film is not entirely pitiless for the pathetic criminal class .
a tribute to lego made by enthusiasts , not an ad for lego made by hacks .
it: chapter two feels like a strong improvement , and a solid slice of commercially-minded populist horror .
. . .the movie benefits from the affable work of its various performers .
an earnest "true story" that hits many of the expected importance-of- education grace notes , but never quite achieves a lump-in-your-throat reaction
despite dragging a little , mystic river is worth its weight in what will certainly be oscar gold .
there 's a clear passing of the cybernetic torch at play , which adds an elegiac and resonant tone to what otherwise might have been little more than a rambunctious action flick .
pedestrian , brooding wwii period film features stoic harrison ford .
there 's no denying the value of vendetta as an argument starter , even if the basic argument -- when is terrorism justified ? -- is something less than novel .
scenes of life among the hasidim are soft and amber-tinged , in keeping with lumet 's idealized conception of their lives . the effect is so pronounced that it begins to grow comical .
through that mixture of luck and diligence that makes the best documentaries , timoner offers a resonant , often painfully funny , drama about two good friends who become enemies against the backdrop of the pop-music business .
france 's claude chabrol , venerable (76) chessman of suspenseful bourgeois rot , moves his pawns superbly again , though we see the checkmate coming .
although the screenplay tips our sympathies wholly in the young man 's direction , it 's cleverly structured to reveal the particulars of the long-ago crime , and what led up to it , in flashback .
c 'est avec grand bonheur que j 'ai trouvé le + long des épisodes des simpson le + drôle depuis quelques années au moins!
kingdom of heaven seems ready to anger everyone but the atheists and the action crowd .
this is really a wonderful adventure-comedy .

outside of demonstrating wuornos ' ignorance and apparent mental illness , i 'm not sure what jenkins ' point is or what theron is trying to convey about the film 's protagonist .
nothing much happens in low down save for good acting .
unless you 're a connoisseur of movies that are so bad they 're good , hide and seek is one game you 're not going to want to play .
ten minutes into the picture , you 're searching the screen for life-support machines .
mcginley , as it happens , is the film 's only trump card , his madcap multi-tasker stealing every scene he 's in and leaving the movie 's nominal star for dead .
fanning is nearly perfect as ginger navigates choppier waters than most teens have to . there is not a false note in her performance; no matter how melodramatic things become , everything about ginger remains genuine .
estupenda muestra de lo que se puede lograr con una historia que muestre a las personas como lo que son: seres humanos en busca de su realización y su lugar en la vida .
fascinating stuff , but after a while the film runs out of things to say and falls back on clichs .
finally , a cinematic genre heretofore mired in pietistic melodrama and safe aesthetic distance has been blown open and virtually reinvented , even the well-known contours of its subject matter reinvested with urgency , meaning and mournful honesty .
goes out of its way to offend virtually everyone , including mexicans , jews , african- americans and especially evangelical christians .
arctic is stark and visceral , stripped of any distracting elements , and for the survival movie purist , it 's an artful entry into the genre .
i don 't think you 'll feel 'happily ever after ' when the film ends , but you 'll be pleased enough by its magic .
the year 's must-see doco for movie buffs .
sherpa is an accomplished , gripping film .
and yet , the pervading sensation is unfortunately one of a film brand trapped within its own blueprint and unable to evolve .
the first chapter stands as one of the best horror movies of the last few years . this one is just . . . adequate .
best worst movie might not be the best movie ever made about a bad movie . but it 's still a pretty good and pretty fun one .
looks aren 't everything but here they 're enough to keep you entertained most of the film . beyond that , the only way it will have resonance is through the daft punk soundtrack .
the designer 's droll wit makes this a compelling (if bitchy) documentary .
messy .
a string of unrelated scenes about the high-school musical . . . the band 's final concert , some random moments in which some standard-issue popular girls are mean to lola , and lola 's active fantasy life .
stunning . a bit dark , but often whimsical . . .what you have here is close to a classic .
curse of the were-rabbit ' has enough wacky inventiveness and pure silliness , including a greenhouse in the shape of a church , to entertain both children and adults .
an oddity . . . stilted .
the whole thing plays like a really long robin williams ' talk show appearance with a plot slapped on .
the matchmaking games in emmanuel mouret 's romantic comedy shall we kiss ? may backfire , but nobody is seriously hurt .
it 's not nearly as engaging as the many films it parodies , but it 's a charming little tribute .
so sweet it could send diabetics into sugar shock , but is great entertainment for the audience for which it was intended .
fond nods to wahlberg 's cinematic past ("it 's like the size of a mini cooper") are thrown in , and it 's imaginatively shot , yet it all feels rather too familiar .
song to song is slightly disappointing . rooney mara 's voiceover only offers empty platitudes and ryan gosling 's romantic hero is sweet and endearing but ultimately quite boring .
the exhilarating documentary "sunshine superman ," which melds gorgeous aerial photography of boenish 's jumps with sublime musical cues , finds in boenish a kind of poet-adventurer , equal parts pixie and desperado .
the debut feature from australian writer/director mirrah foulkes eventually provides enough of a revenge fantasy to satisfy , even if the road there is a bit windy and bumpy .
old fashioned feels like a familiar work of juvenilia , something similar to those terribly insightful relationship dramas your college roommate wrote on lonely nights .
aspires to greatness by pushing its social concerns and big ideas up front for all to see . but the film falls far short thanks to some pretty ropey writing , undistinguished direction and variable performances .

damon conveys the vulnerability of his character , but the script fails to explore why whitacre makes the choices he does . he 's simply buffoonish .
as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project .
flimsy , fake-looking weaponry , bad wigs , grandiose scoring , overacting , simplistic dialogue , illogically elaborate staging , and a plot that goes out of its way to be predictable . . .
a great and authentic thriller regarding journalism in its most relevant century . [full review in spanish] .
errol morris is one of the true masters of the documentary form .
it 's an ice cream soda of a movie , frothy and fun .
[has] absolutely no idea what to do with a really swell concept once it gets past the exposition stage .
a nicely gory comedy-horror flick that is a diverting bit of lads ' entertainment .
the heist itself isn 't all that clever , but the way the plot slowly unfurls is both brainy and emotionally intense .
we know how she does it . the better question is: why should we care ?
the animation is competent . . . but the story and humor are only repeating previous ideas . [full review in spanish]
when straining for significance , slow motion is his answer every time and the lameness of his ending is infused with a risible shot of sentimentality .
a single moment of magical realism shows the babe-that-might-have-been , very charitably speaking , had the makers of this doggie adventure-comedy chosen a more daring and creative route . . .
so slick , so clever and so incredibly lucid that it neither leads to much in the way of thought , discussion or , unfortunately , repeat viewing .
subtly sweet and compassionate , appealing to art-house filmgoers of a certain age .
maybe these movies are popular , but it seems they just keep getting more inane with each variation on the theme .
the material lends itself to a succinct crime picture but the filmmakers have greater ambitions: they 're trying to evoke the feel of a wilting community . it doesn 't work .
a film deserving of a conversation and , in no higher praise , of unreasonable comparisons .
it sort of sits in a blank , defeated slump .
this stunningly exotic film of conrad 's classic features o 'toole in the title role .
far and away the best thing about it is mr . woods , who served as co-producer and demonstrates a clear understanding of what makes great movie detectives great .
ricki and the flash offers a breezy , heartwarming , if somewhat manufactured tale about an aging rocker reconnecting with her family . streep nails the lead role , and she 's supported by a solid ensemble cast .
a film you need to be in a receptive mood to get on with - objectively , it 's about a pretty rotten character and his petty life - but with real emotional pay-off .
a great example of a woulda-coulda-shoulda movie
if you 're patient enough to stick with it , the emotional payoffs are profound .
solace will certainly come and go from the pop culture conversation in the blink of an eye .
possesses wisdom that is rare for film these days , let alone a debut .
such a gentle picture that at times it threatens to drift off the screen .
one of the year 's more satisfying films .
an eye-opening look at the possibility of an accused pedophile 's innocence . . . it is a compelling caution against quick judgements made without benefit of all the facts
based on a play , and adapted by the original playwright , sadly the narrative hasn 't translated at all well and the structure feels out of place .
surely the filmmaker 's insistence upon imposing his favourite device upon all his narratives is edging towards shyamalan-like overkill .
a movie such as this can easily get by on charm , so long as we get a surprise or two from the rest of the script . therein lies the problem .
a silly movie that puts the loony in clooney and the ewww in ewan
told in quiet scenes of proper behavior and guarded speech , the queen is a spellbinding story of opposed passions .
shyamalan has taken what could have been a big , flashy , generic hollywood production and made it wholly his own .
once in a blue moon , there comes a film that speaks to you . a film that you wholeheartedly connect to and makes you feel seen in every form . for me , this is that movie .
performances are the saving grace of a film which , while certainly not lacking in dramatic heft , seems more preoccupied with sexing up the scandal than getting to grips with those at the centre of it .
while it is always a pleasure to watch such heavyweights hold the screen together . . . they deserved far more for their efforts than an emaciated potboiler that finally boils dry .
like any winning streak , it can 't last . and neither did my interest , mostly because the movie kept telling me something i already knew: gambling addiction is sad .
it aims to entertain , to offer a few tame chuckles for parents and children to enjoy in a purely saturday-morning way . and it accomplishes that .
given that they left out some scenes it was a bait and switch .
nobody can film an epic battle scene like kurosawa .
this lighter-than-air bauble proves a pleasurable diversion indeed -- as long as that heart beating inside your chest has at least a mild propensity for the romantic . bring a date .
if it 's gratuitous saxon violence you 're after then you 've come to the right place .
all of [the cast members] , especially ms . lyonne and mr . arkin , project a crazy sincerity that turns this personal and nostalgic comedy into a very true story indeed .
if you can overlook the ridiculously transparent plot that is about as breakable as a pair of chop sticks then you would come to easily appreciate the razzle-dazzle artistry of this overzealous chop-and-sock kooky comedy
great cast , but 'mean girl ' wedding comedy is mediocre .
overlong but enjoyable documentary . . .
if it 's not the greatest western ever made , it 's certainly in the top three . this is the movie that made steve mcqueen a star .
life misses the mark by perhaps a sixtieth of a second , but that 's enough .
an excellent performance by a relatively unknown soon-to-be-superstar forms the foundation of "dreamgirls ," the cinematic cover of the stage hit .
it all looks so darned real , you 'd swear it was filmed on location of a 15-year-old 's hyperactive , sci-fi-addled brain .
with a complex plot that unspools with surprising clarity , running scared displays a reckless intensity .
still tense today , more than 60 years after it was made
a pretty much paint by numbers job , but clooney and the divine ms . jones have great chemistry and timing and successfully manage to wrestle the script to the ground .
compelling film about truth deals with intense subject .
yet more proof that michael douglas can do anything he pleases so long as he 's playing a jerk .
. . .one of christie 's greatest works adapted into one of the screen 's best films .
kid-friendly without straining to be too down with them , shazam! is a film that finally injects the f-word into dc 's dark and angsty universe: fun .
it 's not exactly tweeter-material to say that freeman has maintained a high standard of acting excellence for decades , but he truly delivers a memorable performance that channels mandela expertly from his tone to posture and dignified grace .
it all feels like it 's a smidgeon away from being a spoof movie .
this unique fantasy is crude and vulgar , politically and racially charged , as well as sexually ambivalent . in other words , it 's flat-out terrific!
it tests our patience , but then rewards it , not only with beauty and terror , but also with an emotional sucker punch that has yet to be equaled .
one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
streisand is capable in an implausible role as a liberated jewess , and redford is . . .well , redford .
it 's a noble effort , but aficionados and the mildly interested are recommended to seek out vh-1 's excellent studio 54 documentary in lieu of this shallow morality play .
impossible to describe , impossible to forget .
vivian says they are heading for the 'age of hope ' , but this movie is heading more for the 'age of the video store ' and it should be arriving soon .
frozen river is a quirky drama driven by a couple of outstanding performances .
a far cry from such sneakily subversive werewolf-sex tales as the company of wolves or ginger snaps , this pallid little picture is all lost boys posturing by way of the sublimely ridiculous covenant .
there 's a lot of pg-13 jiggling .
for a while there , the film has us going .
. . . this is a movie that will lose nothing when you rent it from netflix a few months from now .
the black-and-white version 's stark contrasts give greater claustrophobic force to the fragility of civilization when ideology grows as deadly as any marauding beasts . prepare also to be knocked cold and gut-kicked for good measure by its ending .
the perfect man takes its idiotic plot and uses it as the excuse for scenes of awesome stupidity .
whip-smart , pop-literate , self-aware humour saves the day (and the universe , come to think of it) .
take away the plane crash , change the setting from south america to antarctica , and swap humans for canines and eight below is a virtual remake of [1993 's alive] .
redbelt is screaming for the guidance of someone with enough distance from the subject to mold it into satisfying drama .
a poignant , powerful tale of first love and untimely death as well as a practical , frankly undeniable , plea for marriage equality .
all we get are scattered bits of cleverness , some hit and some miss .
somehow [gens] turns the vacation destination of lanzarote into the ends of the earth , and you 'll feel that chill on your soul .
a sobering examination of a family falling apart under external pressure . dano 's eye for cinematic exploration does overwhelm some narrative inconsistencies but it 's a solid debut , and well worth seeking out .
[t]he antidote to bloated , stupid threequels and mindless junk food cinema . bourne isn 't just the best action movie of the summer , it 's one of the best movies of the year .
carlos saldhana has here created a sweet-natured animation .
totally harrowing .
coming at the end of a dismal and frigid january , the second screen adaptation of elmore leonard 's first foray into crime fiction is like a paid hawaiian vacation -- somebody else 's .
strange as it may sound , this is one of the most enjoyable films of the year .
road house gets by on dingbat charm .
while redbelt may be a character study in search of a movie , that character feels fresh and real .
a film of unwavering weirdness and intensity .
presented with the opportunity to do the first-ever big-budget easter bunny flick mixing live action and animation , "hop" gives us . . . a bunny who poops jelly beans .
the white countess is never less than lovely to look at , and sometimes much more .
liman keeps everything tightly wound and over the course of its brief 90-minute running time dwain worrell 's script presents a compelling look at how conflict is repeatedly escalated by underestimating the enemy .
beautiful loneliness , as the film suggestively reveals , is a texture that frank knows all too well .
it 's a deadly bore .
sorry , on the road just doesn 't travel well .
it does justice to n .w .a 's biography in a very entertaining way . [full review in spanish]
steven soderbergh 's most entertaining movie in ages . . .
rust creek is an excellent example for future filmmakers to show that good quality action-thrillers are not reserved for the big studios .
while you watch the movie , it can seem ridiculously long-winded . but once it 's over , its characters ' miserable faces remain etched in your memory , and its cynical message lingers .
the climactic inferno , which explodes whatever credibility the movie built up , is immediately followed by a cheap , out-of-the-blue supernatural twist . the equivalent of a forged signature , it attests to the movie 's essential falsity .
if you 've seen dazed and confused , thirteen and/or the myth of the american sleepover you 'll know exactly what 's coming .
a powerfully effective documentary on the astonishing life and democratic vision of pakistan 's first female prime minister .
a grand , richly achieved fantasy epic that exalts such previously uncool virtues as honor , loyalty , self-sacrifice and chivalry .
signs is deliberate and shocking from its sweeping exterior to its raw , emotional interior . orson welles would be proud .
most of the time , the sentimental rom-com antics and underdeveloped archetypes feel as fake as the big bellies the ladies are showing off .
a slightly more serious take on the rom-com , this film benefits hugely from its likeable cast even though the script lets frequently them down .
it unfolds as a series of madcap , effortlessly charming comic vignettes , centred around food and food culture in mid- '80s japan .
it 's so alive with raw heartache and intoxicating performances it feels like a story no one 's ever told before .
with simulated simians authentic enough to make project nim look almost phoney , allied to an involving , evolving story , rise is the planet we 've been waiting for .
a crazy mixed-up film .
hear ye , hear ye . films don 't always have to be revolutionary slice-of-life cinematic art . sometimes they can just be cheesy , nonsensical fun . like perfect stranger .
this young adult movie is among the dozens of titles featured in the 2015 holiday gift guide at reelbob .com .
the story is simple , but effective , and a pleasant and charming diversion .
kathryn bigelow has shown hollywood how it 's done: the hurt locker is the strongest and most satisfying thriller in years .
where 's kirk cameron when you need him ?
one of the absolutely stupidest mysteries ever to receive studio financing and a legitimate theatrical release in this country .
mccarthy builds his narrative with care and without sentiment and it 's impossible to not feel for these characters . who hasn 't taken an easier way out rather than the high road at some time in their lives ?
m . night shyamalan 's forced "trilogy" doesn 't prove unbreakable and ends not a moment too soon with a weak third entry called 'glass ' , but despite a game cast you can see right through it .
a tribute to all the dispossessed in our world and an amplification of their silent screams
what we hear is shocking enough; thankfully oppenheimer leaves most of these savage horrors to our imagination .
crooked cops . the mystery and allure of hollywood in the '50s . death , double-crossing , and secret alliances . paparazzi waiting to get that one breakthrough picture .
poetic outlaw romance is beautifully acted but violent .
one factor , and one factor alone , brings 'how do you know ? ' to above average .
this film deals honestly with the difficulties of coming out in high school .
a crude , crass , virtually laugh-free sex comedy .
everything you 're looking for , provided you 're looking for nothing .
it 's clever , cool fun and it looks great .
the movie 's high points are its makeup and special effects . the movie 's low points are almost everything else .
little more than a brain damaged , irony-free , and curiously toothless attempt to retread the success of last year 's surprising summer gorefest , piranha 3d .
just isn 't the larger-than-life , heartrending crusades masterpiece we were praying gladiator 's director would deliver .
it doesn 't ultimately make any sense at all and , for me , its charm wasn 't enough to sustain the whole ramshackle structure .
yes , there are some funny moments here and there , but the movie never has the point of a real farce .
about an old couple on the verge of decrepitude deciding to make a go of their marriage because they have no other choice . yeah , it 's awful .
more of a telethon-ready fund-raiser than a work of dramatic reportage .
there will not be a dry eye in the cinema .
it 's obvious , but it needs to be said: oh maggie , baby .
the blessing and the curse of "novocaine" is that the storyline veers wildly from sequence to sequence and even from genre to genre .
aside from feeling bemused and confused by the end , the web of deceit that 's presented is not even vaguely believable .
tom cruise is as ageless as this remarkably fresh franchise .
culture-clash buddy comedy has some crude humor , gun use .
the yammer and righteousness defeat clooney and even julia roberts , stuck at a console twitching knobs and micromanaging frowns as the producer trying to hold the show together .
the portrait of a loopy outsider mostly serves to remind us that it might be time to watch fargo again , just to get a glimpse of the true story .
so uninteresting and overflowing with lame jokes that it is sure to bore viewers of every age , shape , and size .
as long as he 's being superficial , gilroy proves his artistry . it 's only when he steps outside the role of pleasure provider that his workmanlike efforts begin to crumple .
james wan conjures up a truly paralyzing tale of supernatural terror with his retelling of ed and lorraine warren 's most disturbing case , creating scares through detailed and properly crafted horror storytelling - not a body count .
masterfully edited .
despite some decent moments the film struggles to realise its potential .
a wonderfully acted little drama about a tight-knit group of ordinary people whom we get to know and like despite their quirks and flaws .
strives for honesty in its depiction of drug addiction , not just for the user but their family who are , at times , more affected by this crippling disease
basically , the movie is an old-fashioned morality play , for all its lurid details .
remarkable .
either a return to form , a winking homage to the whole series , or a dumbing down of the angsty , introspective bond of the daniel craig era . choose up sides .
few movies have done such an eloquent , evenhanded job of defining the conflict between colonialists and natives determined to free themselves from foreign rule .
familial devotion has seldom been so horrifically explored on the screen .
when it 's not going for outlandish smut , cat people is a shambling bore .
credit co-author and director michael mann for infusing with wit a film that easily could have been unbearably pretentious , and credit al pacino , who plays producer bergman , for doing the same for his character .
foreign-film comfort food . . .at its best in exploring the psychology of the adopted .
this might lack the raw lengthy unease of the original , but for the most part it sticks to what was creepy about [it] .
represents one of the few clear-headed , uncompromising looks at [alzheimer 's] and its impacts .
with five main characters , a host of cameos and a precipitous balance between comedy and darkness , joshy gets a lot done , and does it very well .
duvernay uses this situation as a light but poignant metaphor for ruby 's personal growth , as she finds a way to escape her own kind of prison .
so-so sequel that tries too hard to be the first film .
a multi-faceted drama that 's simple enough for the masses but accomplished enough that few critics could succeed in smearing it .
in telling this remarkable true story , director jean-marc vallee (the young victoria) and his gifted cast keep the characters and events so grounded that we can 't help but get caught up in their story .
the 1978 version was funny (donald sutherland 's jokes , jeff goldblum 's jeff goldblum-ness) , spooky and unpredictable , with likable characters . this one is just as clinical as a pod person .
while not as accomplished as lady bird or eighth grade , giant little ones avoids the usual high school clichés , crafting an honest and nuanced 21st-century coming-out story .
it 's an immersive , old-fashioned experience -- walter hill or sam peckinpah would approve .
portman 's strong performance here is part of the film 's problem . she stands out in surroundings that don 't rise to her level
sometimes the right part comes along at the right time for the right actor , and the film that results from it forever changes his or her career .
bhoothnath never finds a comfortable balance between broad comedy and the bittersweet relationship between nath and banku , each of whom fills a void in the other 's existence .
mature , meticulous and faithful in its own fashion , this is the best of the roth adaptations that have come out in the last 15 years .
. . .recreates the broadness of early silent films without capturing their artistry .
a somewhat nauseating blend of sensitivity and entitlement - sublime because it says so .
a modern horror classic that is smart , funny , surprisingly unpredictable throughout .
the heroine has become a lonely divorcee , resulting in an unexpectedly added depth to the story . it 's surprisingly satisfying , recommended for anyone who 's ever wondered if there really are second chances .
ready player one should make fans of 80s movies , music and video games geek out , but it - and the convoluted way the story 's unveiled - might alienate others .
director bryan singer approaches this sensitive material as a strict procedural . it 's almost as if we are joining part two of a miniseries already in progress .
a pleasingly drowsy summer action comedy .
as a standalone film , it delivers intense and engaging action . though , i couldn 't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the final battle sequence we have waited ten years to see .
hysteria might be the most unlikely romantic comedy of the year -- if not the decade .
prime is a somewhat enjoyable look at a budding , albeit complicated , romance . but it tends to take itself a tad too seriously .
cold creek manor is bad on purpose . it 's just not bad enough .
charlie kaufman 's existential fantasia with the odd name is a weird , tiresome rumination on love , hate and the creative process . fellini did it far better in '8 1/2 ' in 1963 .
phil lord and christopher miller 's second-best film of the year (behind the lego movie) .
for the most part , the final movie delivers the combination of emotional intensity and rousing battle sequences befitting the end of a phenomenon that evolved from an unexpectedly popular children 's book series to an era unto itself .
if you 've seen the griswolds go off on any of those national lampoon holidays , you 've sort of already experienced johnson family vacation .
if any piece of art-house cinema can be called an essential , this mesmerizing , haunting work can .
the film betrays a gratifying faith in the audience 's agility .
for adult audiences , it creates a mesmerizing daydream of sexual fantasy .
burton has pulled off the near-impossible: a fresh look at a classic .
this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
[director gabor] csupo doesn 't condescend to his audience; the complications of grade-school life are extremely serious business to the people experiencing them .
. . .could have gone in numerous intriguing directions , and it chooses the worst one of all of them .
in adapting the 1924 novel by ernest pérochon , director/co-writer xavier beauvois has captured both the emotional intensity of conflict , and the way in which it forever changes those it touches .
the film is so dull you really do need to be a masochist to sit through it , although some viewers may find the lavish wealth porn an escapist turn on .
triggers tron: legacy flashbacks like wet heat does vietnam .
slattery is more adept at conjuring an authentic , sympathetic milieu in support of his large , talented ensemble than he is at ensuring the plot mechanics don 't creak .
it is a story seemingly meant to be funny but only fitfully successful in this mission , and way too pleased with its own brand of deadpan wisecracking .
i just don 't know if we 'll see a film as smart or fun or overwhelmingly rich as rango for the rest of the year .
sarsgaard and jones deliver incredible performances that make this rather quiet picture ever so enticing .
the results are what one might expect from two nerd gods of filmmaking: a visually stunning computer-generated heroine , impressive futuristic world-building , and some seriously neat action scenes .
ken takakura 's memorable performance , occasional light comedy and striking chinese scenery don 't keep riding alone for thousands of miles and its big message from being ponderous and affected .
it 's a different approach to drama , i 'll give it that . but it 's not a very dramatic one .
yeah , it 's heavy . it 's also unexpectedly funny , deeply moving and almost unbearably wise when it comes to the labyrinthine workings of the human heart .
bogliano 's unnerving mood , complemented by grungy camerawork and a shroud of sonic chaos , provides an emotional strain that makes anything possible .
it 's a friendly record of an extraordinary moment .
every time i die lives up to both the evocative nature and the weirdness of its title .
in the film 's most extraordinary discovery , we see the only existing film footage of anne frank , taken one day in 1941 , before the franks went into hiding .
funny , light and perforated with wicked one-liners , it takes the initial premise from judd apatow 's knocked up and drives it into entirely different and eminently more satisfying territory .
a satisfying if largely perfunctory action flick .
labaki is so enchanting you 'll find yourself looking forward to her next appearance .
daniel lutz is a tremendously interesting , at times moving and at times deeply off-putting interview subject .
payne 's interest is the human drama: he 's very much the director-as-novelist and the descendants has all the satisfactions of a story well told .
a well-meaning and inadvertently timely attempt to tackle the troubles , whose thriller-toned accessibility occasionally trips over cine-clichés . meanwhile , a confident , complex sturgess makes his strongest impression yet .
presenting itself as a sort of found-footage movie for geeks , this amusing and thoughtful oddity by writer-director-editor andrew bujalski is upfront in form but more stealth in content and intent .
get ready for the first big , vaunted , art house movie heavily lauded as a masterpiece and oscar contender that will leave you wondering what all the hype was about .
you hope for the tang of lemon drizzle; what you ultimately get is madeira , with the proverbial soggy bottom .
oyelowo and pike have solid chemistry together . oyelowo gets the big , speechifying , showcase moments -- but pike shines in quieter scenes .
works from beginning to end despite some unnecessary moments . [full review in spanish]
a brainless piece of product that is so utterly devoid of anything not concerned with the idea of separating 12-year-olds from their allowance that it makes the hannah montana infomercial/movie seem like "there will be blood" by comparison
profound , haunting , tender , warm , captivating , intelligent and brimming with humanism from start to finish . charlotte rampling and tom courtenay give well-nuanced performances and find the emotional truths of their roles with conviction .
michael shannon moves through "the iceman" like a shark .
the only stephen daldry film i 've seen that i don 't expect to feel the need to revisit .
muito falatrio e pouca ao .
not a pretty picture , but you won 't be able to take your eyes off it .
a charmer .
this is it is jackson 's moment to shine . for two hours , he 's alive and kicking it .
it makes for a more thoughtful experience than the average law & order episode , to be sure . the film also overreaches , though , winding up a bit disappointing .
it 's an entertaining spy movie , more in the vein of a john le carré novel than a jason bourne adventure , that is engaging throughout its runtime .
heart-warming , beautiful , and a tim burton masterpiece , dumbo brings you into this world of wonder and feels as if you 're home among medici 's family .
the film is much too long with occasional false notes -- overwrought scenes which strain credibility . . . but lane , who 's never acted before , gives an astonishingly complex and persuasive performance .
for those who would question crichton 's motives , levinson and attanasio haven 't let men off the hook .
what spielberg has done in this holocaust story is simply and forcefully place us there .
its creaky , all-consuming insistence on its characters ' normalcy entombs everything interesting about them in contrived schlock and transparent gloss-over techniques .
for all its genre delights , oculus is little more than a well-tooled creepshow .
robots is packed with so many funny cultural references and movie tributes you 'll forgive the thin plot that starts to squeak slightly in its final third .
a halloween ghost story with a curiously calming effect .
the film bubbles merrily throughout .
as bad as hannibal rising is -- and believe me , it 's terrible -- this fictional biography of the beloved dr . hannibal lecter could have been worse .
if the phrase "brett ratner 's hercules starring the rock" sounds like a fun movie to you , then you 'll get your money 's worth from hercules .
gifted 's two leads make great travelling companions .
this film has no teeth , and philosophy doesn 't help you chew .
a gentle adventure-comedy that sails a heroes ' journey so straight and true that joseph campbell would smile .
a bracing , mesmerizing , bitterly funny and deeply unsettling fable .
the ease that the next generation actors slip into their roles gives nemesis a comfort zone that overcomes creaky dialogue and that fact that the biggest moments have been seen in earlier trek movies .
the best harry potter picture yet .
love & mercy is an uneven biopic boosted by strong performances . expect a vibrant soundtrack , but also a story that doesn 't completely fly on the sum of its parts .
i couldn 't get this film 's quiet power out of my mind .
a remarkable testament to working class lives and the unifying power of art , waste land is a rare thing - a film that makes you proud to be human .
more than once i found myself thinking: what a planet! which means the movie did its job .
the animation is superb , the vocal work flawless , the script witty , the central conflict between family ties and the pursuit of excellence subtly handled .
this oestrogen-packed incarnation of new york 's finest ghost hunters turns out to be an affectionate homage to the 1984 original , never straying too far from its source .
this might not be the epic sort of effort that the carpenter fans have been waiting for , but it 's still a damn good ghost story that knows how to mess with an audience .
. . .drab and listless spookshow .
the tract goddard and whedon use allows characters to expand and explore more realistically , making the viewer care far what is going on and what is happening then they would have otherwise .
i admire the film 's gusto to look at the hippie era , but its shock factor is more of a bail out rather than letting the story reach a meaningful conclusion .
i took a friend 's 10-year-old daughter to see the film , and she found it 'too childish . ' and who am i to argue with a member of this film 's target audience ?
too slick but amusing marital farce .
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
american son is an eye-opening film that ought to make audiences think after viewing it .
more than the sum of its facile narrative parts .
it 's so featherbrained and lightweight , it almost elevates its inconsequence into a style .
an epic journey worth taking .
muschietti makes the scares in mama too obvious to be effective , but the quiet in-between times suggest genuine horror . . .
i 'm sure this script seemed like a good idea at the time , but the final product feels like a film student 's idea of a saturday night live sketch .
this is renoir as cultural anthropologist , observing and dissecting and appreciating , with every painterly-composed scene .
smith continues to make the goofy plot , wild spectacle , and crazed alien antics look good .
a messy , though mostly amiable , comedy that can 't quite decide who it wants to entertain .
no ordinary rock doc , but nothing particularly special either .
joaquin phoenix isn 't johnny cash . but with the clip-clop of rhythms behind him , aiming his guitar like a gun , he puts on one sensational show .
vacancy is an enjoyable , pleasingly old-fashioned thriller with strong performances and some expertly handled suspense sequences . recommended .
a sequel better than the original -- and better than the book on which it 's based ? it must be magic! and indeed , the second harry potter movie is enchanting .
this is the kind of movie that gives remakes a bad name .
very funny , yes , but it also represents a clear statement from rock about his career . it 's his best film by a considerable margin .
it 's loud and boisterous , and features plenty of slapstick and bodily function humor . and , at shorter than 90 minutes , little ones shouldn 't get antsy .
[helgeland] beats up on the catholic church with the same brainless zeal and pointless histrionics as such grade f noisemakers as lost souls and stigmata .
unfunny disney comedy . sinbad needs a better vehicle .
a slight improvement on its predecessor but also the cinematic equivalent of a cynical studio executive 's checklist of items that need to be included in a smurf movie .
more than just the slasher horror you might expect from its setting , dead night is an ambitious film whose strength is in its strangeness .
despite the old fashioned , mawkish tone , i found the story to have a cumulative effect on me .
cliche piles on cliche , but it 's good-natured , undemanding fun .
confounding , exhilarating , challenging--and the best movie i 've seen so far in 2011 .
yes , it 's a good , solid movie about a horse that no one expected to win .
sappy , sentimental and redeemed only by the quiet radiance and fidgety intelligence of its leads , last chance harvey is a fantasy about mopey middle-agers getting a second chance at love .
absorbing and satisfying , just like a good old-fashioned page-turner of a novel .
it descends into pathos , undermined by an insipid romantic subplot and the usual platitudinous guff about self-belief .
an extraordinary bore .
it 's all fine , entertaining stuff , bookended with some rip-roaring set-pieces .
surreal coming-of-age fantasy -- with muppets .
the horror dial 's turned down to mute in a british fright flick about a dead rock star haunting a recording studio . while there 's the germ of a good idea here , the execution is just terrible .
an emotionally-unsettling alternate version of a controversial chapter in america 's slave legacy!
often leaves us unmoved .
the result of two long years spent with the heavy metal godfather , this compelling and well-constructed documentary lures the real ozzy out of his cartoon shell .

jlo glows in friendship comedy with swearing , racy humor .
good entertainment
gory , profane , sexy superhero story great , but not for kids .
cooper has a ball with the role .
enjoyable horror comedy that delivers on the promise of the title , aided by some decent effects and a witty script .
borrows its structure and characterization from the matrix , its central conflict from both underworld films , its fashion sense from blade and its euro-tech-metal soundtrack from the first xxx with vin diesel .
the film delivers the same misogynistic , faux-modernistic jolts of trashy humor and labored plotting that typify the work of co-producer michael bay .
it 's quite funny at times and has some good performances . but it 's so predictable it has no bite , either as social satire or as slapstick comedy .
a meandering mood piece , with no tension , no chemistry , no character development , no plot and no point .
painfully unfunny , inordinately stupid , and about as entertaining as a colonoscopy . if there 's a worse film in 2013 , i 'll be very , very surprised .
bier spices up the long-hackneyed generic formula with lush location cinematography , outstanding performances . . . and subtitles , but otherwise the movie needs a lot more than love .
the ritual is shot so beautifully it helps mitigate that uneasiness .
[suicide squad] forgoes interesting characters and engaging plotlines in favor of faux nihilism and flat one-liners . there 's simply no reason to care about anything or anyone in this bumbling ballet of idiocy and pyrotechnics .
on the david letterman show this week , will ferrell said he was not an idiot but a buffoon . 'the other guys ' gives moviegoers yet another chance to parse the distinction .
the movie 's most interesting character is agent dylan (dwayne adway) because he almost never says anything . would that all the actors had been so eloquent .

essentially , piranha is the best example of how to do a b-movie knockoff .
with the story told more through the eyes than the dialogue; barren-yet-beautiful locations and the late jhann jhannsson 's score , there 's a dreaminess here that 's all too rare an experience in modern cinema .
unassuming and mildly pleasant , but mostly unassuming .
thoughtful , moving , impressively-directed sci-fi with a great performance by clooney -- the pace may be off-putting but this is a deeply rewarding film .
a shrieking bore .
a slapdash amount of effort , modest effects and a modicum of talent are on display , but the imagination deployed is negligible .
much like fellow sports movie warrior , the film gets you rooting for both sides , and makes the races between [hunt and lauda] that much more tense .
unfortunately , bewitched regularly loses touch with its funny elements and drifts off into vaguely dull subplots .
there will be lots of seething at the sight of it all , but there are enough good laughs to make the experience more than worthwhile .
it 's an odd , puzzling film .
i think it is visually exciting . i think there are wonderful things in it but i just missed that innocence of the early films .
[it] broadens the appeal of its cult property , turning what was once strictly nerd fodder into a shaggy dog action movie .
for a film about passion , it feels oddly flat and often passionless .
for all of the ferocious flashes of brilliance achieved by wunderkind director zack snyder , there are almost as many fatal flaws .
if only the coens had directed . [full review in spanish]
the quaint rituals of nobel week are the darkly-funny underpinnings of this well-acted if not terribly surprising drama .
an obvious improvement over the two alien vs . predator movies . . .
succeeds on the talents of its attractive , charismatic cast and the focused efforts of director gut ritchie .
a genuine thrill ride with a soul .
luscious , inventive , and always dreamy .
queen of the damned wouldn 't be so bad if it weren 't so boring .
it 's a pleasant enough diversion , but it 's not really about human beings and contains not one genuine laugh .
when was the last time you were presented with a film featuring "saturday night live" actors that didn 't send you running for the hills ?
another month , another anodyne tween-com from hilary duff .
a wrenching rush of adrenaline set in a never-ending cycle of occupation and struggle and ever-increasing tension .
. . .just another typically erratic endeavor from bay .
fun , harmless sequel to the disney classic .
aniston 's comic gifts haven 't deserted her , but her judgment may have .
a movie-of-the-week treatment of race and class , the film credibly portrays the day-to-day workings of an urban ministry .
this final (apparently) film from steven soderbergh presses all the buttons .
a supremely annoying film .
[the] handheld , digital camerawork provides an ultra-realistic , immediate feel , but also highlights the film 's cautious , dramatic sidestepping .
biutiful is by no means the passion of the christ but it certainly shares the cynicism and self-righteous obsession with suffering that typified mel gibson 's well-shot abomination
either do something new and different with the underworld franchise , or better yet , leave it dead .
prisoners can be quite good when it chooses to be a regular thriller . unfortunately it decides to try for more , and comes up short in doing so .
a highly imaginative and stylish delve into madness and seduction , that takes known horror tropes and twists them into a unique and engrossing character driven movie .
it is a fairly brutal and stylized account of the miseries of a famous comedian/director .
the coolest part of "attack the block" is how it does a switcheroo with the thugs , initially encouraging us to think they 're rotters and then showing us there 's more to them than meets the eye .
a film that once again serves as a vast parking lot for used yesteryear action stars .
the plot 's pleasingly convoluted , the performances amusingly varied , the mood sinisterly sustained . but the set-pieces are the work of a genius .
christopher nolan remains an abstract artist at core , and the tricky structure of his spectacular dunkirk is not far removed from the games played in his science-fiction blockbusters inception and interstellar .
this film is about as accurate a reflection of how people break into the music business as in the night garden is about temperate-zone forest habitats .
truly feel good comedies don 't come along often enough and this one is impossible to resist .
the overwrought nature of the film actually suits the larger-than-life canvas on which broad strokes are frequently painted .
the film looks spectacular , the characters are marvellously cheesy and , instead of the subversive wink to the audience that we might expect from a title like this , jones is never condescending to his demographic .
a worthy addition to the growing annals of movies and books advocating for sustainable farming methods .
if "mystery science theater 3000" were still on the air tom servo and his quick-witted robotic friends would be all over this thing .
this is the kind of old-fashioned sweeping romance that would have played the bottom half of a double-bill in the 1940 .
an unusual and interesting feature that tries to convey the inner state of a non-communicative young woman mainly through reaction shots of her face .
[it 's] a largely silly , disjointed construction of run-of-the-mill scares and awkward priest jokes , but at least director mike flanagan gives it his best shot , which is more than we can say of his predecessor .
when you 've got talent like jen lawrence fronting your movie , the least you could do would be to just to develop her character . just a little bit .
. . . there 's an energy and optimism here which belie the grim subject matter and [director andy] serkis knows just how to tweak our heart strings when it comes to the final reel .
an unusually nuanced and mature depiction of one of those hoary movie fantasies: the older man who gets the much , much younger woman .
i have seen many stupid movies in my life . but [this] would still count among the stupidest , had i seen twice a many movies in half again as many genres .
1980 isn 't a placeholder by any means , but it suffers by its middle placement , lacking the newness of the first film or the cumulative satisfactions of the last .
mr . mehta has done something difficult . he has made a film of conviction that 's neither plodding nor preachy .
slumdog millionaire is just the sort of rags-to-riches yarn that turns academy voters ' heads .
the crackerjack script and dynamite performances are almost enough to get the front runner across the finish line , but there 's something missing .
. . .an unquestionably awful , awful film .
turns spectacle into a contemplation piece .
frustrante que um cineasta veterano como ferrara exiba um interesse to grande pelo sensacionalismo e pela explorao de sua prpria fantasia masculina quanto pela importante ideia que busca discutir .
spends the majority of its running time jerking the audience 's chain before coming to an abrupt ending .
was the conclusion unforeseen ? definitely . did it make me think about or learn something about the human condition ? not really .
this thoroughly absurd action flick that thinks it has some sort of social conscience , badly needs a what-the-heck-were-they-thinking smack upside the head to humble it .
[screenwriter] williamson 's back in fine form .
pretty much everything about rings is incoherent .
there are plenty of decent laughs , but the shadow of the far superior british zombie romcom looms large .
swedish writer-director ruben ostlund follows-up his memorably compelling 2014 relationship drama-cum-cringe-comedy force majeure with another thought-provoking meditation on modern social mores .
gags involving plaster-cast penises , obscene topiary and alcohol-laced breast milk won 't be to all tastes , but at its slapstick best the film is hilarious .
it 's more like a broken record .
nicolas cage is excellent , again , as a fractured man suffering the slings and arrows .
for every obscure sci-fi nod , there 's a crowd-pleasing spielbergian trope: scrappy hero crushing on an independent gal ? check . friends banding together ? got 'em . greedy corporate villain ? yep .
rising above the paint-by-numbers approach favored by goold is the immaculate performance by renee zellweger , who takes this movie by the throat the moment she first takes the stage .
for all its many shortcomings , this old-school laugher is a pleasure to sit through .
horton hears a who! is razzle-dazzling and artful , and it builds on seuss ' words by the clever cart-full .
john mctiernan pulls the stunts off with such finesse that the script problems are almost irrelevant .
. . .jolie 's scott is just not tough enough to overcome her incredible beauty and make us believe she can get down and dirty when it counts .
the good news is that queen of the damned isn 't as bad as you might expect . the bad news is that it isn 't nearly as good as its predecessor , interview with the vampire .
kawase employs a highly elegant style that is somehow both very documentary-like and very poetic .
watch for brian cox 's extraordinary and powerful portrayal of winston . arrogant and egotistical , he arouses both exasperation and sympathy - something that could also be said for the film itself .
a flat and tedious action film .
adorably preposterous
while the characters sometimes feel roughly drawn , the casting is spot on .
nothing fresh or original here , but director-writer patrick hughes enjoys a heightened sense of detail , making the most of dark bars and the interiors of stalled vehicles .
one of these days , someone should make a movie about a really nasty old guy who , by the end of the story , is still a nasty old guy .
[chan and li] punch , kick , jump , and fall all over in an extended sequence that never feels too long .
an object of blunt force and breath-catching beauty , snowpiercer plays what-if with a familiar doomsday scenario: what if noah 's ark never found dry land again ?
scorsese 's long-awaited epic is ultimately disappointing -- it 's messy , much too long and incredibly violent , but worth seeing for a staggering performance by daniel day-lewis .
i had not seen a coming of age movie as funny and philosophical as submarine in a long time . [full review in spanish]
strong in its resolve , lyrically composed and poetically captured , love after love reminds that death isn 't an end or beginning for those left behind , but a moment that defines what happens next .
'the break-up ' breaks down in the end
while aronofsky 's artistry is at an all-time-low , it 's his misogyny that makes the film abhorrent .
a load of overwrought nonsense in which the souls of seven twentysomethings are imperilled when they disturb the undead quietly mouldering in the basement .
eloquent , elegant and utterly heartbreaking , sin nombre is one of the most exciting pieces of cinema we 've seen in a long time .
a vast improvement over its unwatchable , hopelessly dated predecessor . . .
imagine someone pouring hot , melted starburst candies into your corneas , and you just begin to approximate the experience of speed racer , an ice-cream headache of a movie . . .
despite meryl streep , liam neeson and the usually estimable edward furlong , this nonevent huffs and puffs to attain even the level of an ordinary motion picture .
isn 't so much a film that will scare you in the traditional sense , but will certainly resonate with you long after the credits have rolled due to the fear-inducing complexities it serves its audience throughout
dark , claustrophobic and depressing , but it 's too destructive for its own good .
the nonsensical and surreal journey you are taken on will have you questioning what you just saw , yet at the heart of the film is a story of love and despair that translates across all languages .
the perfect summer entertainment , an exhilarating , heart-stopping thriller that doesn 't let up for a minute .
the various implausibilities in this film do not diminish its tremendous watchability , and in particular the lead performance of renner .
the film 's sidelong narrative glances suggest a privileged world brimming with innuendo-laden excess and barely concealed sexual jealousies .
it 's one of the year 's best , most deeply felt films .
a mediocre tom cruise mystery thriller that 's entertaining in the moment but instantly forgettable .
gorehounds and zombie freaks should enjoy the zombie scenes . . . but rotten zombie brains splattered into the camera lens does not always a good movie make .
abrams brings a fresh perspective that strips the series to its essential elements while still paying homage to what made the original special in the first place .
what abrams has given us is the gravy without the meat and potatoes .
an extended bit featuring a strung-out toddler borders on offensive and isn 't amusing in the slightest , so much of the picture leaving me as cold as an arctic winter .
what is striking about it , of course , is the way that the filmmaker manages to garner sympathy for an essential villain .
an intimate study of an outsider that is bound to move , compel and touch even the most hardened of punters .
a movie like this rides on its cinematography , and alwin h . kuchler evokes the cold darkness so convincingly that kingdom come seems built on an abyss .
a crafty undertaking that balances mystery with panic
in the end it was a little too strange for my taste , but i know fans of the dark and mysterious will love it .
it doesn 't offer viewers anything more than the sight of a talented director treading water with a story he seems to have little interest in telling .
a strange and appealing animated film that explores the unusual adventures of a lonely boy and his eternally frisky dog .
full review at movies for the masses
black comedy and teen romance dont usually work this well together .
the pleasure here is in the fine detail , and annan makes sure we feel every scrape of chisel on wood . the characterizations are not deep , but that 's part of the genre .
an endearing romantic comedy that explores many different dimensions of love and nurturing .
nothing but crap!
the hero of oss 117: cairo , nest of spies might be described as a french equivalent of james bond .
charming silly fun
the family tree is a surprisingly funny dysfunctional family comedy that manages to entertain throughout .
it 's fun a lot of the time . several individual shots are hilarious .
think back and try to recall the last time you saw a hero on the screen who stepped aside to serve others by making himself a zero .
. . .howard surely deserves credit for infusing the production with a distinctly cinematic quality that generally belies its stage origins .
sharknado is an hour and a half of your life that you 'll never get back . and you won 't want to .
it 's rarely clear where we are or how we got here , but ericson core nonetheless delivers some vertiginous 3d thrills .
an offbeat story with an unfocused director and narrative , prince avalanche becomes a mere lucid dream of cinematic enjoyment .
a work of genius .
rather than emphasizing the dangers of technology , rings warns of the worst case scenarios for unnecessary sequels .
it 's a perfect comeback vehicle for a 67-year-old actress -- light , safe , undemanding and sure-to-be commercial . it is also a fairly tedious , stupid picture , but you can 't have everything .
great b-movie fun .
if you 've seen the annoying trailer for bryan bertino 's singularly pointless debut feature , you 've seen all the film has to offer -- - 88 minutes of tedious sadism .
"the perks of being a wallflower ' ' is the sort of lower- budget personal film you hardly see being released by a major distributor anymore , except during awards season .
shines a welcome light on a group of everyday heroes who , in risking their own lives to save others helped turn america 's darkest hour into their finest - and ours .
[for no good reason] paints a strong portrait of the illustrator through archival footage , photography , and long discussions with steadman about his artistic process .
i really had a blast with haywire .
this overly staid film seems to cry out for a climactic , cathartic dose of wild , passionate unpredictability that the director is never fully willing to indulge .
it 's fairly serious stuff , perhaps because the movie was thoughtfully scripted by maria maggenti , who wrote one of the best-ever movies about adolescent girls , "the incredibly true adventures of two girls in love ."
"water for elephants" is a surprisingly good film that once again shows that first impressions aren 't everything .
it 's a likeable comedy with many pratfalls , a couple laugh-out-loud moments , and a deep understanding of pageant superficiality .
it 's the sort of movie every summer needs . and stick around for a fun post-credits sequence that hints at a sequel .
passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .
some of the best work disney has done in at least a decade .
it 's almost as if the filmmakers wanted to say something about isolation , and loneliness , in the urban environment . almost .
the last witch hunter starts off with traces of sly humour , but gradually collapses into a unwieldy combination of special effects confrontations and ponderous exposition .
winter in wartime is nothing more or less than a skillfully directed , good-looking coming-of-age tale .
a maniacal montage of cartoonish battle sequences .
the picture is a little about soccer , a little about parenting , and a lot about laughing . mike ditka shows up and delivers a kick-butt performance .
it 's a shame this did not work . it almost feels offensive to the filmmaker 's culture to approach these stories with such lack of cinematic sense . [full review in spanish] .
much-maligned but sporadically effective . . .
lowe and spader deliver some great work in this fairly familiar , yet still enjoyable , thriller .
jolly enough but far , far too nice . a satire with no bite that seems much more like a chance to preach at an apathetic electorate .
the cast delivers , green 's direction is adequate , and the script is , i suppose , adequate . adequate . that 's a pretty good description for what 's going on here .
never has a horrific incident been so ripe for biting satire .
scary , chilling and thrilling despite occasionally choppy editing and a mostly shallow screenplay that doesn 't quite reach the emotional depths of the babadook .
the new , more assertive bella swan is the most welcome addition to the twilight saga -- that , and the sly humor rosenberg 's snuck into eclipse .
it 's just a shame danes and the others are working with one arm tied behind them , so to speak , due to a lack of inspired material .
what rugrats go wild! lacks in visual splendor it makes up for in comedic spunk .
despite the torn-from-the-headlines subject matter , the international feels generic .
as a portrait of noble striving , you could do a lot worse .
. . .in the vein of john le carré .
ultimately , it 's just a pleasant little movie where the dramatic highlight is whether or not king george vi will bring himself to eat a hot dog .
the film 's joke is kind of one-note , although it maintains an exhilarating beat throughout . if sound of noise is the rhythm of the new city symphony , play on .
it evaporates almost as soon as it reaches your retinas .
presents two annoying people and has them yell at each other for an hour or so .
vantage point offers a modicum of entertainment but it requires viewers to react more forcefully from the gut than the mind . it 's viscerally effective but lobotomized .
bright is basically a tired buddy-cop movie dressed up in bizarre trappings .
the connection is a genre exercise by a director finding his feet - slick , sure , but lacking heat 's taut set pieces and the de niro-pacino star wattage .
vice approaches a dark period of american history - and a dark horse of a character - in a witty and irreverent way .
the hitman 's bodyguard is the kind of film you discover while channel surfing , stop on , and end up watching the whole thing without any previous intention .
good , but . . .movies don 't come more overrated .
human drama doesn 't get much better treatment in the movies than this enormously affecting and beautifully acted independent film . a masterpiece .
while not quite as subversive and refreshing as the first "trolls ," "world tour" offers endless cuteness , an impressive voice cast and just enough depth for grownups and children alike to chew on .
the strength of the film lies in the naturalness with which we participate in the evolution of colette . [full review in spanish]
a delightful , easy-to-like , crowd-pleasing rom-com that is perfectly fine to watch on a saturday night on the couch .
in its cretinous fashion , furry vengeance is almost impressive . here 's a pro-nature , anti-development family comedy that appears to be made by and for people who never leave the mall .
untraceable is prototype internet conspiracy drivel , with a hackneyed plot years too late and a simple premise of good cops and innocents against sickos .
small indie that has all the ingredients of a typical hollywood meg ryan romantic comedy from the 1990s , including meg ryan , but lacks the spark of the best of her genre .
oh , how i joined the rest of the world to watch and hope when the miners were trapped .
more concerned with the novelty of its three-act , "three-perspective" structure than with how that structure actually functions .
. . . lazy , unimaginative storytelling that tries to fool the audience into thinking it 's clever .
if you can swallow the porcelain chastain as a tattooed bass player in a punk band , then the supernatural hooey will not seem in any way hard to believe .
like director david ayer 's previous movies (he wrote training day) , street kings is about the joy of badass coppery .
. . . a rare melodrama set in the world of men .
this is a work full of sensitivity , humour and wisdom , enacted with ferocious passion .
another low in hollywood 's descent into virtual flesh-peddling . . . stone proves that she 's still basically a "star" only to the extent that she strips .
you got to hand it to joaquin phoenix for fully inhabited his role of a loner on the verge of psychological breakdown in "joker" .
this surprisingly gritty drama stars dwayne johnson , not wrestling star the rock , which may disappoint those looking for a meat-headed action flick .
the timing of this violent cop picture may be ill-advised but a gruff and ready mad mel (as in gibson) makes it watchable on its own wannabe-noirish and b movie terms .
syriana really makes viewers work to try to understand the complexities involved in protecting (or resisting) u .s . interests in the middle east .
it is a terrifically entertaining film , alive from the start , following its marvel mission (for good and bad) while rising above it .
the movie is a compendium of white upper-middle-class suburban banality , cheap scares and eye-crossingly monotonous drama .
"beyond" is the highlight of the animatrix and "a detective story" is its nadir .
while [eastwood 's] minimalist tendencies can be simplistic and reductive , sometimes they and the story they are telling successfully meet in the middle .
allen is both more scathingly funny and self-deprecatingly vulnerable than he 's seemed since annie hall .
the allure of chet baker 's stage persona compared to the shambles of his personal life is staggering in bruce weber 's fitting elegy to a genius who lived hard yet made it all look so easy .
neighbors is rude , brazen and merrily offensive , and the movie mines the homoerotic undertones of fraternities to fine (if lowbrow) comic effect . but efron , of all people , gives the film a curious edge .
the perfect spider-man movie , far from home is an adventure for the web-slinger like no other and will leave fans talking for a long time to come . prepare for your jaw to be left on the floor!
while the theme of 'what are you doing with your life ? ' resonates , it 's not much fun to watch , in spite of splendid performances from all concerned .
genuinely frightening .
the conjuring 2 won 't send the same shiver of movie magic up your spine , but it 's a solid sequel with plenty of tricks up its sleeve .
. . .millions pulls off the neat trick of affirming that money can 't buy happiness , even as it has a ball pretending that it can .
a rom-com monstrosity .
long way north is a charming and simple feature that mines themes of family and determination in the midst of challenging trials .
office christmas party has just enough laughs to nudge a positive recommendation . jillian bell is hilarious . she steals the show from the all-star cast of comedy veterans .
maybe the new sequels and spin-offs can be more adventurous , but the force awakens had me smiling , reminiscing , and critiquing all at the same time: it hits all the marks , without any real surprises .
like a cigarette , it 's damn tasty , full of blistering action and surprisingly sly humor , but not very good for you .
at the end of the day , johnston 's childlike stream of unrequited love landed him on mtv , atlantic records , and now a feature-length theatrical recounting of his life . take that , satan .
a lot of tension and buildup leads us to . . . well , it 's hard to say .
nobody of chan 's legendary stature should ever have to play second banana to george lopez , and certainly not in a film that was already made five years ago with vin diesel (see: the pacifier) .
i actually enjoy freddie , but like ryan himself , "summer catch" throws inconsistently .
stylish sci-fi visuals aren 't enough to keep the signal from collapsing under its own emo poetics and landing in a dead zone .
even if you vaguely remember the outcome of this absurd episode , there are enough surprises and revelations to keep you on the edge of your seat .
if scott could somehow have spliced the dna of the first movie with that of the kubrickian masterpiece that he just can 't shake , then he 'd have an alien that was truly strange .
. . . bores its way in and lingers for hours , even days before we finally can come to terms with it - and ourselves . but the less we know , the more we understand .
this dark , vicious film gets a bit muddled at times but the strength of its lead performance and a strong visual palette make it a stark but worthwhile trip .
i love the way the animation looks , i think it meshed well with the live action .
undefeated is all heart . even those who couldn 't care less about american football will find this an affecting story about a man who really gives one hell of a damn .
[the] experimental touches , such as dramatic re-creations with thomas ryan adams and tilda swinton playing steve and hope , distract from the issues at hand .
an all-time great "b" western with metaphysical undertones .
still impressive sets and stunts have kept this from getting stale .
takes all of the bad things about the original and makes them even worse . . . of the most excruciating movies in recent memory (splice today)
the coen brothers have crafted another unique period piece .
all the problems that i have with passion narratively are overshadowed by the fact that de palma the visual master has shown signs of life for the first time in a decade .
there are stupid stoner comedies and then there are stupid stoner comedies that ain 't funny , and the latest effluvium from adam sandler 's happy madison production company is mostly a bummer .
can 't decide whether it 's saluting the series or spoofing it . . . .the yee-haws start to give way to yawns . . .

the acting is not bad , but the film is ill-conceived
although it runs over a few cobblestone potholes , this 'game ' is afoot and affecting thanks to rougher narrative choices , a dynamic performance from downey and taking a few crucial chances that pay off .

it 's pure drive-in , midnight-movie fare , but "becky" knows itself and executes well .
despite the ridiculous premise and casting this is still a pacey little sci-thriller .
this could have been one of the best sci-fi films of all time if it wasn 't for an extremely unlikeable lead . but the last 40 minutes are so awesome that i can still recommend it .
her beauty , independence , and stock portfolio notwithstanding , chelsea 's tale is a timely , tragic one told with typical soderbergh finesse , a sly , sleek merger of sex , lies and hi def video .
this is a genre i usually enjoy and while closed circuit has some shortcomings it 's a thought-provoking thriller .
"ender 's game" truly captures the spirit and intensity of what is one of the most popular sci-fi stories of all time .
[an] uninspired , generic psycho-chick flick . . .puerile and simplistic in its synthetic gimmickry , obsessed oozes nothing but contempt and a cornball solution for exploiting the repetitive misogynist melodramas

one of spielberg 's worst movies .

this story felt a lot more like the old television show than the first feature film ever did . it wasn 't great cinema , but what do you expect ?
some of it doesn 't work , but it remains a gloriously ambitious romantic epic and a truly memorable big-screen movie experience .
another tour-de-force for singleton
features the spierig brothers at their innovative and creative best , while also boasting a revelatory performance by sarah snook .
endlessly fascinating and compulsively watchable
a movie with oodles of flash , loads of style , and a penelope cruz song and dance number that will leave every man in the audience needing a very cold , cold shower .
an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience .

tamara drewe is the very model of a modern british film .
enjoyable , well acted romcom that pushes all the right emotional buttons , though it 's not as consistently funny as it should have been .

it 's been eight years since clear and present danger , but this late-blooming entry shows that none of the luster has worn off the series .

the imagery is equal parts ugly and beautiful as the tale descends into a nightmare most could never conceive .
"i don 't know how she does it" suggests what might have happened to carrie if she had two kids with mr . big to worry about , and less time to obsess over her wardrobe .
the daily grind of a brick lane bangladeshi is credibly brought to life in this sensitive and intelligent adaptation of monica ali 's novel .
spider-man: homecoming is light , quick and never too serious , bounding with a playful sense of humor lacking in the increasingly angsty and no longer fun franchise .
a film that 's easier to admire (at least in part) than actually like , but it 's also a difficult film to ignore .
filmmaker [ruben] östlund 's design is fascinating in the way ebba 's story soon becomes a litmus test for gender , family , and even age issues among all who hear it , including the audience .
there are laughs here , some pretty big , but it 's such a slog that this hot tub will leave you cold .
earnest but misguided biopic
father hood is a genial , simple-minded chase picture in which a small time thief learns to love his children . i didn 't believe a single second of it , although i enjoyed a few of them .
not a disaster by any means , but neither is it the futuristic parable it so clearly wants to be .
its effects will stick with you , even if you don 't quite understand them .
some of the intended moral heft goes astray in the heat and dust - but this is still a promising dry run for bigger things .
an engaging and energetic biopic .
one thing this latest rehash - no 11 , by my count - does achieve , is make the original look like a frickin ' masterpiece .
'a lot can happen on the road to nowhere , ' reads the tagline on the poster for wild hogs , a comedy that also illustrates exactly how nothing can happen on the road to nowhere .
bee movie is fun , if not formulaic in its humor and story approach . the writers threw in every . . . bee joke and situation you could think of , yet the movie still works .
a paean to the art of storytelling as it existed before mass-produced visual media replaced the spoken word as the primary creative medium .

una de esas que gustan cada vez ms , a medida que se ve y se vuelve a ver .
. . .static , slow-moving and perversely timid . . .
absolutely hilarious toon sees will smith getting his best bond on as he plays a superspy who becomes a pigeon!
it 's like monty python and the holy grail , but not as entertaining , and forget funny , at least , not on purpose
it 's pretty obvious that captive state is not meant as science fiction film for the masses , but rather , one meant for dedicated sci-fi fans who read novels and want to be challenged intellectually .
it 's a monumental subject , and this heartsick but diffuse movie only occasionally glimpses its entirety .
no one can deny the commitment of the cast , but the law of diminishing returns dictates that it 's time for the purge to go .
it 's all laughingly implausible , with crowe 's character coming across more like nicholas sparks than the sort of wordsmith able to craft prose that could compete with the donna tarts and michael chabons of the world .
this is a fan 's film , with all the flaws that entails , but doubters might emerge converted .
this is as deliciously romantic and ingeniously mischievous as cinema gets .
a reach exceeding robbins ' grasp .
as interesting on screen as it is behind the veil

another brilliantly conceived examination of the human condition by the modern master of such fare .
like most of welles ' hollywood efforts , shanghai was shanghaied by studio tampering . . . but it also contains some of his greatest set pieces , topped by the delirious shootout in the funhouse hall of mirrors .
an imaginative movie about the magic of the beatles ' music .
what now for hollywood , which is bruising from the #oscarssowhite controversy while kevin hart shows up everywhere like he 's the orphan black ?
the movie has some astonishing visual effects .
it 's not just oscar bait for its two dazzling leading men . it 's a fascinating look at the land of opportunity as seen through the eyes of its most amoral opportunists .
perpetually feels as if it were a good idea that was never fully thought through .
like a brooding nightmare , burning washes over audiences with passing visions of multiple lives , secrets and betrayals , all leading to no single , clean-cut or simple explanation .
get him to the greek provides a nice blend of laughs and unexpected moments of real warmth
the most notable thing about it is its mixed message .
this admittedly stupendous-looking film deserves quite a lot of credit for trying , even if the end result never quite makes it
give these two a better script , and you just might have a comedy classic . instead , we have here a tolerable near-miss; enough to keep the hunger pangs away until a real meal arrives .
no other movie (documentary or feature film) has featured as many "wow!" moments as this one does in quite some time .
the mystery isn 't deep , alas . and neither , as we 've long suspected , is the filmmaker .
the result isn 't an easy film , but it is rewarding .
so after all that heartache , it looks as though gilliam 's dream has turned into something of a nightmare .
this cheeky fable rests on the slender shoulders of etel and mcgibbon , and the lovely , natural performances boyle elicits from them are the film 's real miracle .
um retrato perturbador da inquietao do homem moderno .
feeble as comedy , the movie is needlessly violent , too , as if half the crew misguidedly thought they were making a foul-mouthed action thriller .
it 's a nice , pleasant celebration of friendship , but without much meat to chew on .
part alice in wonderland and part hansel and gretel . . .
you 'd have to go back to 1950s b-movies , maybe to bugs bunny 's encounter with marvin the martian , to find sillier science .
there 's a parallel universe where del toro made hellboy 3 - you can find me there .
you can 't exactly blame jones for leading such a clichéd rock-star life . you can , however , blame director stephen woolley for making such a clichéd rock-star film .
not only have we seen twisted many times before , we 've seen ashley judd in twisted many times before .
such over-the-top emotional extravagance that even cecil b . demille in his silent period might not have been able to get away with it .
the writer-director of "lost in translation" and "marie antoinette" has made the malaise of the privileged her special turf . ennui is her milieu . and coppola has a talent for revealing its existential and cultural dimensions .
woody allen is back in top form with this sparkling comedydrama . its highlight is a fabulously funny and passionate performance by cruz .
the whole film is played with such an infectious sense of fun and at such a snappy pace that you can 't help being swept along by it .
the film sees the creative process as a sacrament in which the play 's not the thing but the getting there is .
it 's knightley who makes the duchess a royal treat .
while it 'll certainly make you wince , gordon 's slapsticky execution and misguided injections of humour serve only to bleed the situation of suspense . what emerges is not so much horror as a grisly farce .
without washington the picture would wither into dust . with him on board it proves , well , perfectly adequate .
a real one-off .
even with its strong themes and performances , atonement will be enjoyed most by those enthralled when the craft of filmmaking becomes an art .
wayne kramer thankfully refuses to cloak his excessiveness in hedge-betting self-consciousness and the result is a gratifyingly disreputable b-movie blow out .
veteran french star francois cluzet and award-winning comedian omar sy are both excellent and the chemistry between them really crackles .
it 's a superbly rendered , supremely creative effort that lovingly pays tribute to 1980s arcade games .
mute possesses so little sense of style , of directorial muscularity , that it fizzles out long before its 125 minutes are up .
the actors had their roles down by the end of the first film , and it 's a pleasure watching them play the familiar crew with just enough of a twist to fit the new timeline .
like the skateboarding punks of the film 's title , lords of dogtown is good-looking , energetic and rather aimless .
this is pure pulp pleasure , the cinematic equivalent of great beach reading . . . and what better way is there to describe the work of elmore leonard ?
even if filmmakers have trodden similar paths on other parts of the planet - iran , for instance - and though a little patience is required , collins draws you in with the suggestive power of hush .
while there 's certain promise to a comedy about a family that 's almost utterly loathesome (it worked for the addamses , didn 't it ?) it 's necessary that the movie think so , too .
date night isn 't a comedy classic but it is undeniably a lot of fun , and easily hits the laugh quota .
this is a movie so paltry in its characters and shallow in its story that the war seems to exist primarily to provide graphic visuals .
there 's precious little to like about the witless and decidedly tedious black knight .
the final damning verdict left by the american box office , whom far from raced out to see it , meaning takings of 8m leave punisher: war zone the lowest grossing marvel adaptation to date .
a remarkable documentary about inmates at an alabama prison who do a 10-day silent meditation retreat which opens them to the experience of inner peace and compassion .
often , the results are compelling .
dorothy was right: there 's no place like home . and that 's exactly where you should see this film: on tv , for free , instead of paying for it in a theater .
you don 't need a horoscope to know it 's a bad sign when the quirky , jumbled , plodding plot is incredibly implausible .
a killer comedy with a vicious sense of humor . the running undead look fantastic and are dispatched in a never-ending , ever-evolving innovative shopping list of carnage . you 'll applaud every crunch .
the spongebob movie: sponge out of water mostly nails what has always made the character , and his brightly coloured underwater world , so endearing: the abundant innocence , the welcome lack of cynicism and the out-and-out stupidity .
denis villeneuve succeeds in making 2049 feel distinct from ridley scott 's film without sacrificing aspects that made the original so powerful .
[soderbergh 's] direction is flawless; choppy editing , a muddy pallet and a camera that gets up close and personal with every facet of the fight , however small , effectively making the viewer part of the revolution .
in arguably one of the best performances of her career , gyllenhaal is the key to the emotional , increasingly disturbing nature of the kindergarten teacher .
tarantino definitely has a point to make about slavery , and it is there , but it is well hidden behind a stout curtain of fun , which is ultimately what you 'll get from django unchained .
alternately painful , perplexing , awkward , melodramatic , and slow to overwhelm .
costner might not be the box-office draw he once was but surely he can find better things to do than this dismal europudding ?
cianfrance 's moving but messy melodrama can 't quite conjure the elusive alchemy of adaptation .
the filmmakers border on sophomoric desperation , achieving a measurable shred of humor only in the outtakes during the closing credits .
impressively directed and superbly written , this is a hugely enjoyable , constantly surprising and thoroughly gripping thriller with terrific performances from its three leads .
more than honey is a phenomenally well-researched and thorough study of bees and their complex influence on human civilization , and an in depth investigation of the honeybee colony collapse disorder .
some of the incidents are funny , some are so-so , some are flat . and , of course , in the end , it is concluded that for all this , the family is still strong .
mostly this is one long , loud , stupid road picture .
against this atmospheric background the characters have the depth of stick figures .
the best tomb raider movie we 're ever likely to get .
it 's best just to give yourself over to its dizzy dreaminess and abstract analysis of the persistent , beckoning throb of the digital underground .
banks is one fierce talent more than able to carry a film all on her own , and here 's hoping the next starring vehicle makes for a much smoother and consistent ride .
more often than not "celeste and jesse forever" delivers an affectionate and intelligent look at how even the closest couples can find that breaking up is so very hard to do .
although bears doesn 't have a stated green message , it 's hard to see the majestic natural beauty presented onscreen and not feel stewardship urges .
tarantino 's jumbling of his chronology and the clever changes of context from the claustrophobic warehouse section to various character origin flashbacks are sly and electric
the characters aren 't consistent , and cliff eventually becomes so unbelievable that we just stop caring . the movie 's ending is an exercise in plot; its beginning and its music deserve better than that .
a well-deserved tribute to an american icon that manages to turn the nation 's most-famous dirty old man into a champion of racial justice right before your very eyes . who knew ?
a faux-sentimental comedy that not only isn 't funny , but half the time appears to have forgotten to insert the joke .
just a frolicking wonka visionary schnozberry flavored delight!
that this film takes so long to go off the rails -- when really , it could have been an instant train wreck -- is all down to moore 's poised portrayal .
as far as derivative crime sagas go , paul borghese 's film might represent the new gold standard of shameless barrel-scraping .
catchy at one moment and then poignant in the next to match the shifting narrative .
this dublin-set horror rehashes every haunted-house trick in the book .
the film feels careless and calculated at once: careless in its assembly , calculated in an attempt to copy castle . (but who could blame hurwitz and schlossberg ? they have no other film credits .)
historically significant , this tonally uneven biopic is filled with cultural resonance .
sing street blends relatable strife , young love and cheering acts of rebellion into a funny and foot-tapping treat .
day-lewis and krieps both deserve every ounce of praise they 're getting for this film , having delivered two of the most nuanced , remarkable performances i 've seen this year .
the awkwardly told story of salsa legend hector lavoe , el cantante doesn 't even get the title right: it should have been called la esposa , since it 's really less about the singer than his wife .
one of the best told love stories i 've seen in years .
there 's an undeniable sense of finality in spectre , with no clear path forward and an uncharacteristically (for the most recent movies) upbeat ending .
the perfect deconstruction of the melodrama film . [full review in spanish]
a return to tarantino 's small-scaled , dialogue-heavy , non-linear storytelling , bloody , shocking origins . quite simply , it 's one of his best films .
hardcore henry is only partly successful at using the first person pov format to create a unique cinematic experience .
one of the very best marvel cinematic universe films , and one of the best films of the year .
talented filmmakers manage to elevate the uneven narrative and produce an entertaining experience , but 'chapter 2 ' is nowhere near as refined as the original .
with a running time of a few minutes over two hours , sahara sputters along as slowly as a trek across the desert .
the amount of fun you 'll have while watching this is mostly dependent on your skills at playing "spot the pop culture reference" . [full review in spanish]
even the considerable imagination and investment on display here can 't make this fairytale character - or kristen stewart - a viable movie star .
an intense , hard to watch drama , of a man 's life torn apart by his fellow citizens . the performance is skilled enough that it won the top acting award at last year 's cannesfestival .
the lack of character arc for sudekis and the missing brain cells for day 's character undermine what could have been the best comedy of the year .
. . .dashing and daring . . .visually rich in its presentation . . .cleverly combines the elements of surrealistic cinema that pads the excitement of this polished fanboy flick
bob byington 's perspective may be above it all , but that doesn 't quite account for the shades of melancholy that pop up unexpectedly in lines of dialogue and in some of the performances .
tim burton 's latest is pretty much par for the course: two hours of great art direction in search of a movie .
a rattling good sea saga filled with two first-class performances , a memorable portrait of friendship , and a substantive exploration of leadership .
delightful , sad father-son story for teens and up .
the comedian is more successful than not; there are enough laugh-out-loud jokes to keep it going , but they 're interspersed with a lot of material that 's questionable .
some of the scenes contain an artful build-up to the explosive violence , some dispense with it without much ceremony; it all starts to feel the same .
thanks to fey , as well as the other actors , it has grit . but it doesn 't have teeth .
presumably it worked far better onstage , where macleod 's absurdist tale and self-conscious , beckett-like wordplay probably found a friendlier context .
marvel has clearly saved the best for last and i cannot stress how much those fan service moments will have you cheering .
the film is lightly entertaining , making its points about oppression in iran gently .

the danish girl is stunning to look at but rarely powerful to behold , technically accomplished yet also dramatically inert .
a bit of a slog , but for those prepared to stick with it , a quietly haunting tale of obsession emerges .
despite a hard-working cast , a lush score , exotic location shooting and scattered warmth , "barfi!" is ultimately more endurance test than entertainment .
the original death wish reflected its era . the remake of death wish also reflects its era . too bad it reflects the regressive and static nature of our national obsession with firearms .
passably funny star vehicle . nothing great .
a morass of clichés
it is a subversively thrilling treat to see the masterworks of art and cinema given the monkey business so expertly , the process enriching rather than lessening the stature of those works .
takes the woman 's perspective to both mock and sympathize with the old-fashioned notion of the great man 's wife , but with a woefully underused ensemble .
not only urgent , but quite emotionally powerful .
duplicity is more lighthearted; it 's the pitt/jolie smackdown mr . & mrs . smith without all the gunplay .

a masterful , painstakingly crafted adventure about the nature of acceptance , and the tragedy of human nature .
the predator is a goofy , gory , muddy mess that makes less and less visual and narrative sense as it races to its nonsense conclusion . that sterling k . brown and olivia munn though .
[olivier nakache and eric toledano] return with one of [the untouchables '] stars , omar sy , in the title role . it 's a darker , sadder and less audience-pleasingly contrived tale than their previous effort .
a political and psychological thriller that is richer in texture and nuance than its predecessor without sacrificing impact .
in the typical vein of high school teen movies full of joie de vivre , john tucker must die is unadulterated fluff . derivative but somewhat amusing .

the old man and the cialis .
essentially , then , the film is an excuse for tommy lee jones to do his craggy hard man act in a house full of scantily-clad cheerleaders .
not only is this an incredible saga of jack london proportions , it 's also a great detective tale .
things would be real different if vampires ruled the world . coffee would come spiked with hemoglobin , not half-and-half . tooth-whitener ads would feature fangs . and the most compelling public-service announcement would be an hourly sunrise advisory .
the sprawling , dark epic hinges on atmospherics and the moody air . it 's heightened further by the ominous music , especially in the long , wordless opening sequence set in the mines with man pitted against nature .

the film 's imaginative daring springs from its willingness to render repression sexy , even if it will prove to be the seed of a young couple 's dissolution .
with curious fluctuations in tone , questionable motivations , a dull look and jagged editing that takes us out of potentially affecting moments , this tall tale feels slight .
the plot has no surprises to offer but samberg and company just happen to come up with a selection of inane and zany music to gel the narrative together .
radcliffe is literally and figuratively growing into his role , while watson shows greater fire and depth . and grint 's rubbery charm is intact .

it 's lurching , desperate and borderline incomprehensible -- a movie whose characters act according to no known precept of recognizable human behavior .

somewhere between conception and execution the movie turned sour and most of the cuteness was replaced with venom and malice .

lots of good action , but more episodic and uneven than its two predecessors .
technical and narrative creativity take the lead in this delightful sequel . [full review in spanish]
fingleton makes a meal out of complex character drama , raking his audience over the coals with piano-wire tension that leaves you jittery long after the credits roll .

a feature-length movie demands a story , and this one barely has the substance of an anecdote .
starved for a laugh , the film drags on until finally the predictable life lesson is taught and the credits roll .

after the agonizing torture that was endured i can safely make the statement that strangeland is now and will be the worst film of 1998 .
an early candidate for the worst movie of 2016 . certainly the most pointless and least called-for .

[a] wholly unobjectionable , likeably performed but faintly soporific drama . . .
the last exorcism is fueled by the arrogance of its smarmy outsider , the expert who knows everything except what an ass he is .

an idiotic action thriller , vanity project and testosterone-filled guilty pleasure whose sole purpose is to show off a fleet of million-dollar ferraris and lamborghinis belonging to fledgling movie mogul daniel sadek .
evans has long lamented that his fans only seek out his marvel work while his indie projects are largely ignored . playing it cool isn 't likely to change that , unfortunately .
morning glory is a juggernaut . it has one directive: make the audience fall in love with rachel mcadams by all means necessary .

a movie you 've seen plenty of times before , but never mind .

it 's undeniably hokey . but all pulp fiction is ultimately a little hokey , and that 's usually why the makers of such movies compensate by bringing their a-game behind the camera .

the movie tries to be serious and politically significant , and succeeds only in being tedious and pompous .

it 's graceful and sweet and wise where it counts , and often brilliantly acted , and it made me laugh .
maybe we should overlook the fact that the film 's music and songs will be forgotten long before its images die away .

a not-so-perfect 'sexual thriller ' that is short on thrills and any semblance of logic .

lots of lewd sandler stuff , but also some laughs .
. . .sort of a one-note picture , but luckily that one note is often pretty humorous .

austere , rigidly formalized documentary .
a touching story built on conflict: emotional , cultural and physical .
a must-see for cinephiles .
with a twisty storyline that borrows from multiple genres , it 's sort of like a one-man band . it may sound muddled , but it 's unique enough that it 's hard to look away .
this is david lynch at his most imaginative and challenging .
next stop , minor disappointment , followed by growing appreciation .

luciferina is a worth export . [full review in spanish]
the tough , satisfying french film le petit lieutenant is an austere drama of the sort that rarely makes it to american screens except on cable television .

[guy] ritchie is still trying to refamiliarize himself with the borough he adored . . . while its passersby are wondering when the businesses will match up with the times .
enchanting and gentle enough to work for young kids making their first trips to the cinema .

lisa kudrow , the designated comic relief , has never been so consistently unfunny , and gina gershon looks uncomfortable in every (pseudo-)inspirational moment .
a cinematic masterpiece , this feature may be small in scope but it 's momentous in its ability to capture how complex and powerful the civil rights movement was .
an emotionally engaging french drama with strong performances and catchy songs , though it occasionally dips too far into melodrama and its unnecessarily lengthy running time eventually takes its toll .
sure , we 've all seen this story before , but that doesn 't hamper this film from being enormously entertaining , with riveting performances , great beats , and poetic rhymes .
from the cheating husband to the bereft parents , every character earns our sympathy at some point in the picture .
the strongest achievement of the cat 's meow may be the performances , especially those of kirsten dunst (davies) , edward herrmann (hearst) , and even eddie izzard (chaplin) .
i can say nothing kinder about thor: ragnarok than that it is not "one for the fans" . it 's for anybody at home to the throb of a sub-woofer and the scent of the herb .

at least we now know why anne hathaway 's co-presenting this year 's oscars . she 's not gonna make it to that stage any other way .
is it a psychological thriller or a giddy horror of the evil-in-them-there-hills persuasion ? this split-personality number can 't quite decide .

you 'll feel as if you were punched in the face , locked into one of those escape rooms and forced to watch other people solve cryptic clues you can 't possibly understand
the film brandishes the same anti-intellectual cliché we 've heard time and again: extremely smart folks are inherently unpleasant , uptight and unhappy . 'tis better to be a touch dumb .

"grandma" tackles social issues with utter frankness , humor , and intelligence .
john boorman 's direction here is impeccable , capturing well the look and sounds of panama city , and mixing it in with the film 's story .
horses , wagons , occasional indians and villainous white settlers don 't stop "the homesman" from transcending the western tag . in ways both simple and deep , it 's a stark , tender , heartrending , universal tale .
flawed and reluctant to dig too deep , but also a lyrical , haunting and nerve-wracking portrait: the thinking man 's true-life top gun (with cars) .
as for smith , he 's on fire . there 's nothing like a star shining on his highest beams . you follow him anywhere .
if more documentaries were filmed like call me kuchu , the genre could return to its roots of educating and mobilizing viewers instead of simply entertaining them .
it floats , like lively herself , in a kind of timeless bubble .
mcqueen 's artful slow-take style , in films like 12 years a slave and hunger , would seem to make him an odd choice for the ticking-clock pace of a caper pic , but don 't be fooled .
solo builds to a spellbinding conclusion that left me with ironic developments i 'm still thinking about .
"bee movie" has a little bit of something for everyone . it 's loaded with action and sight gags for the kids and enough adult humor to keep the grownups happy .

pixar has done better in the past , but , until their next masterwork arrives , up will do nicely as the winsome fable it is .
the jungle book is well-made and deserves recognition as one of the year 's best family offerings (thus far) .
longtime power rangers fans will genuinely love this movie , which never resorts to self-mockery and (villain problems aside) doesn 't talk down to its audience .
a film that informs and outrages in equal measure .
the animation is -- as with all the early disney 's -- jaw-droppingly good .
. . .one of the few sequels in the history of cinema that is an unqualified improvement over its predecessor in every way .
tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .
a perfectly watchable time-killer that delivers on its promises but also kind of wears out its welcome .
how is it possible that such blatant male wish fulfillment came from a female director and a graphic novel by a woman , writer-artist posy simmonds ?
faster blends the car porn of the 60s with the vigilante justice movies of the 70s . if you like that sort of thing , faster is the sort of thing you 'll like .
shyamalan has been biding his time in the twilight zone , mounting , if not a comeback , a tentative second beginning . . . more ingenious than scary; it could have used a few more hardcore shocks .
diary of a mad black woman has no idea what kind of film it wanted to be , and fails at every genre it tries to tackle .
as impressive as spall and redgrave are , however , both individually and when in the throes of a heated wrangle of power and emotion , it 's not quite enough to carry a whole film .
if you stock a comedy with nothing but stupid , unsympathetic losers , how can the movie ever be a winner ?
the bottom line is that if you 're under the age of 10 or you somehow enjoyed the god-awful 2007 original then you are more likely than not to enjoy this one , too .

[daniels] can 't find his directorial bearings .
there 's something indelible about polley 's portrait of love , an intimacy and playfulness to margot and lou 's relationship that 's particular to them but emblematic of the private language and inside jokes close couples develop .
this time capsule of bohemian new york distorts its representation of the city for reasons more loving than lazy .
the most noteworthy thing isn 't the pictures but rather the hypnotic soundtrack , a vibrant club mix .
reiners and gummer have respective moments where their talents shine , but there 's not enough here to keep any but the most masochistic even moderately interested .
crystal and williams are a must-see match
plagued by andrew lloyd weber 's hideous and already dated musical score (parts of it sound like 1980s hair metal) .
the entire cast is fully committed to this squishily sentimental tale , which is especially impressive given that it 's the kind of generic dramedy you 'll swear you 've seen a thousand times before .
too bad ehrenreich and englert have so little chemistry; it often appears director richard lagravenese shot their scenes with stand-ins .
it isn 't as bad as it could be or as good as it should be - i would wait to see this on video .
cursed with useless dialogue , non-existent chemistry and (the worst sin of all) a boring story , "the lone ranger" proves that not even the independence day spirit horse always backs the right man .

the overall impression is of lives that began before garcia started shooting and continued after the camera was shut off , a remarkable and quietly haunting achievement .
director ben wheatley 's uncompromising style fits the deadpan humour perfectly but despite the movie 's comic tones , the characters are still so unappealing that the movie 's overall nature proves restrictive .
it 's not black 's material that misses; it 's his refusal to let anyone -- especially the audience -- take a breather between all those bangs and kisses .
an intriguing , effects-free take on the apocalypse genre , shifting nimbly between dark comedy and outright despair .
it 's all about the wicked game of seduction , but there 's a distinct unease about pfeiffer 's performance that permeates and dilutes this sophisticated yet poignant concept .
clarkson is about the only thing worth watching .
a fluffy film about nothing , minnie driver and some talented kids keep the cheerful , sunny affair afloat but much like a lazy summer , it 's quickly forgotten once it 's over .
there are some funny moments , there are some sweet moments , there is also a deep cynicism with the political agenda in the united states at the heart of this movie .
another one for davy jones ' locker .
a fascinating true story becomes a deeply repressed movie in the hands of writer morgan (the iron lady) and actor-director fiennes .
. . .the first adaptation of a john grisham novel whose premise and doings i found didn 't ring true for a second . yet i enjoyed the film from beginning to end . go figure .

an intelligent , engagingly honest study of love lost and , just maybe , regained .

there 's no need for her to apologize , as "the sound of my voice" makes resoundingly clear .

a charmless , saccharine sitcom .
in its quiet , gentle way , "shoplifters" builds to an emotional climax that 's all the more devastating for the restraint that kore-eda shows .

enjoyable but mostly pointless .
there 's an unlovely self-importance to sokurov 's droning diatribe that rather distracts from the cultural significance of the subject .
less wild , and a bit less winning than last time , this breezy kidnap caper still manages to take care of business .
as ernest thesiger might have said: oh my dear , the noise , the extraterrestrials .
shiver-making moments aside , in a important way 127 hours suffers from the filmmaker 's lack of nerve , a reluctance to let the audience taste ralston 's dread and the expectation of a slow , absurd death .
under the sea 3d offers a rare and gorgeous look at marine life from the heart of the coral triangle .
terrorism is a fact of modern life . there isn 't a lot we can do about it , so we may as well laugh about it .
illuminating , insightful documentary - a timely film to treasure .
a funny , graceful and immensely good-natured work .
lazy , perfunctory and free of tension , the new version will satisfy neither the admirers of the original nor anyone looking for a gory respite from seasonal good cheer .
instead of eroticism , there is tacky sub-porn; instead of twists , there are knotty plot problems which may or may not have been fixable with script rewrites .
ultimately , the leisure seeker falls into a pile of human-interest indies trying to tip the scales with charm and acting alone . this one doesn 't transcend its pitch .
this war drama , written and directed by dan krauss and based on his own same-named 2013 documentary , is tense and compact but also morally nuanced . it stays complex rather than finding solutions .
sassy pants has a slightly ludic atmosphere akin to another tale of teen alienation , dear lemon lima , but it unfolds like a fable in which only bethany doesn 't feel like a canned caricature .
a cruise on the yangtze , site of the three gorges dam (the largest hydroelectric project in the world) is a fitting metaphor for the promise and cost of china 's rapid modernization .
moore gets to wear a striking wig but has no dialogue that makes you look twice . and the more stacie cries over her saintly lover , the more guiltily conscious you become that your own eyes are water-free .
it 's an ambitious attempt , but one which too often puts form ahead of story .
this chapter from thomas 's later years doesn 't provide enough narrative tension to sustain a conventional three-act film . but it does provide ample material for compelling , duelling character studies .
the intimate symbiosis between the loosely defined concepts of good and evil is a vital element in batman lore and something that christopher nolan understands very well .
the white ribbon is michael haneke 's masterpiece . it is not a movie about abstract concepts or a director 's power over his characters - well , at least it 's not just about those things .
as with previous jarmusch rambles , broken flowers risks getting overpowered by aridity and drift . that it barely avoids such a fate can be credited entirely to murray 's graceful empathy with loss and regret .
what 's probably most amazing about santa sangre is that most of it works , and almost never does it feel like it 's being unsettling just for the sake of it .
blue valentine is an agonizing film , a raw , soul-shattering dissection of a marriage 's end . this is not a film for incurable romantics whose perceptions of love are informed by romantic comedies .
analyzed on its own merits or in concert with the earlier film , point break doesn 't work .
i laughed from start to finish at its relentlessly , energetically profane absurdity and a cast crammed with funny actors in even the smallest roles .

this is by far one of the most intriguing documentaries i have ever seen .
not even [director j .a .] bayona 's efforts can quite overcome the fact that jurassic park: fallen kingdom is a painfully unnecessary extension of a franchise that has been creatively extinct for years .
never as good as the movies it tries to imitate .
deeper , ambitious and morally-challenging to the extent that it depicts the apes and the humans as being far more alike than unalike .

filmmaker oliver stone has infused u turn with exactly the sort of over-the-top , less-than-subtle vibe one might 've anticipated . . .
what 's in the film other than what you might have seen on tv ? yes , it 's in 3d , which adds nothing and dims the picture .
a heady dose of nostalgia , and the question left in our heads after seeing it is , 'why did [disney] ever stop making these ? '

a technically impressive if narratively muddled cgi science-fiction opus in the vein of final fantasy .
audiences with appetites primed by violent , gory tv crime procedurals might not have the patience for the more stately , dignified pace , closer to perry mason than how to get away with murder .
many graphic battle scenes , not for all teens .
orphan contains one of the most terrifying and intense horror endings i have seen in years but the rest of the film was just laughably bad .
chloe descends into a preposterous third act that , by any measure , qualifies as a disaster . but it 's proof of egoyan 's skill that the film works for as long as it does .
an appealing disney sports movie that underplays its potential , glory road is at least a more satisfying basketball saga than last year 's coach carter .
the film is lazily content to simply put its female characters through the potty-mouthed , gross-out comedy ringer .
powerful stuff .
caught between the need to bring the material up to date and the pressure to recycle familiar elements from the original , even when they don 't seem to fit .
pierre salvadori 's delightful comedy , picturesquely set in a series of posh hotels on the french riviera , throws together two terrific comic actors and an irresistible premise .
the almost total absence of anything that actually looks like a narrative is one of left behind 's issues , but it 's not , honestly , one of the biggest .
ao mesmo tempo comovente e hilário , o filme traz guinness em uma de suas melhores performances - e a luta do pintor gulley jimson para realizar sua visão é inesquecível .
fantastic beasts: the crimes of grindelwald is much better than its predecessor in this harry potter-adjacent franchise , if only because it 's a whole movie .
brash , stupid and surprisingly watchable!

the illness in our society comes from the artificial stratification , and defensive denial , of original difference .
" . . .gleeful self-distraction in the face of impending doom ."
sometimes simple is better . the original thrived on few integral characters and a world-wise approach to storytelling . this feature seems to think action is more important than story and an overabundance of characters is a necessity .
there 's not an honest , human moment in the entire film .
. . . when you break it down , [it] largely feels genuinely honest , rather than aspiring to an obvious movie facsimile of "honest ."

classic nicholson performance with some great sexual metaphors .

an intensely personal meditation on the nature of heroism and moral choice , rendered on the kind of rich , dreamlike cinematic canvas that only hollywood can realize .
rather flat , but for spacey 's performance alone this is a fine examination of the u .s . political system and its inherent problems .
co-written by director edgar wright and star simon pegg , this gory zombie satire is filled to the brim with charming english wit .
since the crux of the tale is a teenager 's decision about an unwanted pregnancy , "lebanon , pa ." can 't possibly please everyone . but hickernell doesn 't strain to be provocative .
imaginative it ain 't but , in all , it 's an agreeably girly accompaniment to a box of maltesers . you might also want to take along some earplugs .
one of the best times i 've had at the movies all year .
the story isn 't overcomplicated , comes to a neat bow , and after you 've watched stewart and balinska beat up that many people you 're undeniably entertained .
the script conforms to the hard-and-fast 007 formula -- fans will certainly feel at home .
its closest relative is the full monty - not surprising considering cattaneo directed both - but this is better than its ancestor .
you will walk out feeling exhilarated , whether it will have finished or not will be a different matter altogether!
'captain marvel ' flies onto the screen with adventure and female empowerment .
dwayne johnson and jason statham show that wherever they go they don 't need roads (or diesel) to put on a show . [full review in spanish]
you 'd think a movie with characters named golan and jihad might be heavy-handed , but writer/director eytan fox makes sure the action is based in characterizations that make sense .
based on a film that was based on a book , the third generation of this tale has the pallor of a smudged photocopy of an idea that has been revived without being re-imagined .
it 's the balance of ethnic humor , melodrama and simple charms that make mambo italiano , while not something too special , a solid choice for those who enjoy greek wedding and its other recent spinoffs .
it all ends in tears , bouquet 'd with irony , wisdom and bleak comedy .
while the plot is supremely silly , hardcore devotees will be delighted to find twists and turns along the way .
the further and more competently the movie trundles on , the more it begs not to exist , really: hindsight favours a two-part adaptation at most .
the battle of wits and the search for the truth goes along right up until the film 's unpredictable ending .
get out the game boy instead .
quiet drama has serious themes , well-drawn young characters .
after sitting through this , you 'll need a vacation , too .
chevy chase has some good moments , and those who enjoy his double-talk and pratfalls will find some redeeming value in this lukewarm movie .
it 's kind of inept , but it wants to be better than it is , and that 's sort of charming .
a faithful , compelling screen adaptation of j . m . coetzee 's booker prize-winning 1999 novel .
ritchie back in comfort zone with clever "gentlemen ."
in all these scenes , lewis comes off as an engaged , charming man , although there is no sense of his interiority .
the peanuts movie is delightful from beginning to end and doesn 't rely on baddies , silly sidekicks or lame toilet gags to distract your munchkins .
it 's impossible to take a movie seriously when the leading man looks - and acts - like goldmember .
ms . abramovic is an eloquent and passionate explicator of her art and the experiences that informed it .
certain scenes feel too glib and stagey , as though they 've been doused with pop video gloss - particularly the snow , which surely had its own assistant , make-up artist and trailer .
. . .a dead zone of monstrous proportions that warrants nothing but yawns and groans for all 89 minutes it takes up the screen .
there 's a reason this kind of movie is oscar bait and milk seriously ups the ante in the year 's best actor competition .
it 's fizzingly entertaining . clooney and his team revel in their pastiche of the all-american 1950s lifestyle that still obsesses certain us citizens , and the actors revel in their roles .
demme can 't sustain the fizz , but seeing a real filmmaker try and fall short is still more fun than watching a hack hit the mark .
devoid of extended tension or even an emotionally robust climax to justify the deliberate stride marsh employs , shadow dancer rings hollow even while all the pieces seem so substantial when singled out .
not since goodfellas has scorsese hit so hard , so precisely and with such restraint of obvious flash .
a likeable cast of unknowns wriggle convincingly through the awkwardness of late adolescence in first-time director david robert mitchell 's low-key indie drama .
haunting and sad . and absolutely worth seeing .
a wizardly piece of brutal , romantic filmmaking , it makes old-fashioned beret-based terrorism look a thrill .
it is unashamedly sentimental , old-fashioned and bursting to the seams with important life lessons . but it 's very well put-together , indeed; a smart , effective and , occasionally , funny film that surprises at every turn .
like a plastic surgeon , storyteller king keeps trying to find new ways to lift and tighten his characters , but they have become garish caricatures of themselves .
a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man .
a singular piece of generic transgression , making the unmaking of the west-something that filmmakers had been doing to various degrees for decades-feel shockingly , aggressively , and poetically new .
adams and blunt are spectacular . balancing out rose 's grit-your-teeth optimism is norah 's furrowed-brow cynic . two halves of one aching (w)hole .
shot on high-definition video , chidel 's grisly indie draws as much blood as in any roger corman quickie , but it suffers from an anemic storyline .
the action 's here , there , and everywhere . . . but all this to-ing and fro-ing fails to advance the narrative with the compelling force you crave in movies .
the plot becomes disjointed in the second half and suffers from tone changes . still , the performances are compelling enough to make snow angels worth seeing .
watching these two actors (and off-screen best buds) feed off each other becomes the big draw in british theater director rupert goold 's interesting but ultimately underwhelming movie debut .
a must see for any aspiring filmmaker who thinks that getting a script to the screen is a simple process .
one of the more authentically moving entries in the genre , fueled by a gripping lead performance from "this is us" star chrissy metz .
sliding doors is one of my favorite films so far this year . not many pictures entertain you so thoroughly while still giving you something meaningful to ponder .
anvil is an inspirational documentary which provides witness to the power of the human spirit , played to a heavy metal soundtrack .
spinning plates is a slow starter . . .but the documentary finds more of a rhythm once it moves beyond generalities and starts getting into particulars .
the dialogue with which tarantino is usually adept is disastrously clunky , the filmmaking largely without flair and even the apeing of the smears and scratches of the schlock originals seems ridiculous .
[murphy] continues to treat his career like it were a game of limbo , as imagine that sees the once gifted comedian stoop to a horrendous new low .
the road to the inevitable slapsticky seder is paved with more sweetness than bite , a good deal of frantic foolishness and progressively thinner laughs , all wrapped in a message of acceptance and inclusiveness .
doogal is definitely a dog .
it spins out of control despite the best efforts of norton .
very underrated black comedy from hitchcock is really one of his best works .

the movie provokes low-key laughs (yes , it 's a comedy) , but with a sad overtone .
although the movie maintains a certain level of interest , at times it feels thoroughly scattershot , especially in dealing with its characters .

with two nasty characters for every one appealing character , it 's hard to cheer for these folks .
a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
it is difficult to distinguish where the skin of one (renée zellweger/judy garland) ends and the sadness of the other begins . [full review in spanish]
sexy and freewheeling , if frustratingly slight , it never hits the emotional back of the net in the manner of looking for eric but the lead actors ' charisma keeps you merrily bouncing along .
a pleasant , if predictable , period piece to be savored as much for the breathtaking seascapes as for the deliberately-paced romantic roundelays .
a movie begging this hard to be loved is unattractive .
. . .watchable and mercifully short . wow , what a ringing endorsement .
for a film about erotomania , prom night is a curiously flaccid affair .
parents , take heed: kangaroo jack -- filled with mafioso heists and hit men , camel flatulence and at least one wet t-shirt soak -- will hop right over the perplexed heads of your little darlings .
. . .familiar in its feel-good delivery . . .a solid student-athlete melodrama that creeps up on you more convincingly than a three-point shot at the buzzer

a + is that the stubborn vw bus -- a vehicle that both requires and betrays cooperation -- makes a wonderful metaphor for the family experience .
you probably need a score card to keep track of everybody , but that 's one of the pleasures of jeunet 's film , and it 's also inextricable from his larger point: that war dehumanizes but people re-humanize .

a hyperviolent mishmash that features the worst performance of benicio del toro 's otherwise fantastic career .

less is definitely more in the haunting marital drama 45 years .
reimagining abraham lincoln as a forefather to buffy the vampire slayer is a rather nifty idea . unfortunately , abraham lincoln: vampire hunter , doesn 't fully sink its teeth into its fun premise .
heaven knows what brian de palma (originally slated to direct) would have made of it , but nuts-and-bolts man simon west , with whom statham remade the mechanic , keeps things simple .
the film 's look evokes the 50s flashbacks in annie hall , but it 's joyless , clumsy stuff , pastiche clifford odets .
the final third is a stretch of moviemaking so utterly lacking in coherence and competence that ed wood himself would have been embarrassed to have had his good name attached to the results .
the film feels bland and unadventurous , quite the opposite of what you need for a cross-country trail that can throw up so many possibilities . from top to bottom , it feels thoroughly mediocre .

the film ultimately ends up feeling like a shaggy dog story - a metaphor for ted kennedy , perhaps - engaging , charismatic , but ending with a whimper .

as cop movies go , miami vice does interesting things with unoriginal material .
we all know a guy who is obsessed with military firepower and who spends way too much time playing first-person shooters on xbox 360 . battle: los angeles is a movie for that guy .

corbijn extracts from rowan joffes screenplay a pensive mood of impending dread , but it can be a bit aggravating waiting for the hammer to fall .

romala garai is utterly convincing as the smart , wistful girl with the notebook .
the movie makes for an engaging enough period piece .
those who didn 't sleep through their mythology classes might recall that helius was in fact the son of hyperion . but , you know , greek mythology ? whatevs , bro! have another tecate!
this is clumsy stuff , and arnett looks lost among his slobbering co-stars .
the shaggy-dog story about the sword 's sale , which loses momentum toward the end , matters less than the incomparable , semi-improvised ensemble acting .
the problem is in the script , which is so complicated and violent that the credibility of the entire enterprise is undermined .
playing a cop at his worst , his hands never dirtier , the stakes never higher , woody harrelson has perhaps never been better than he is in the seamy , scandalous jumbled rumble of "rampart ."
there is no great romance , no epic special effects , just a lot of terrible dialogue spoken by wooden actors in a film so cgi dependent; i felt like i was watching a video game .
apocalypse is cheap , incoherent and remarkably free of the kind of gore you 'd expect to find in this kind of movie .
the mind-bending story is enough to keep us interested , although the film is bloated and needlessly overcomplicated .
surely the most lyrical work of cinema to feature an amc pacer .

another singular case exploited and expanded to look ordinary
expert comic performers and a broad script that avoids mean-spiritedness create surprising laughs .
another bleak , harrowingly realistic drama from mike leigh highlighted by a phenomenal star turn by imelda staunton in the title role .

someone shoot me or worse , make me watch this for the millionth time with my older sister!
meyer makes a fine directorial debut , pacing the film for optimal suspense despite some obvious holes in the script .
as the film eschews self-importance , it engages more directly and universally , if only in a rudimentary fashion that fails in terms of overall staying power .
director zak penn isn 't quite up to [christopher] guest 's level but the highlights of the grand suggest he could be someday .
the way it sets up and then sustains its internal logic and distinctive style is a remarkable achievement . it is also a consistently entertaining film from beginning to end .
bahrani 's his experimental (and , some might argue , pretentious) dramas can wander off course in search of honest emotion , often to the detriment of his story .
look out , it 's porcupine guy! his hugs are lethal! and there 's "angel ," who . . .flies around a lot with his shirt off .

it 's time to let the inspector rest in peace .
the acting talent of the cast far exceeds the entertainment level of the movie
what smallfoot lacks in traditional , family-oriented style and delivery , it makes up for with its engaging characters who exude compassion and keep things lively .

without wahlberg 's rock-solid presence as a former marine sniper turned hunted man , the mediocrity of shooter would be clearer sooner .

shelton resurrects the likable costner of "bull durham" in this genial golf comedy .

the movie is structured like an orchestral piece , with three distinct themes that gradually come together in a movement that is powerful and beautiful .

the film is superbly directed , with dim lighting and dark tones illustrating the drudgery of the characters ' everyday lives .
rocky balboa scores a split decision: a familiar start , some flat-footed middle rounds and a solid , flailing finish .
it 's a drama about the struggle for self-respect in the most parlous of circumstances , providing an ultimately convincing and affecting glimpse into a situation that few will ever face by choice .
the age of adaline functions perfectly well as a harmless , fantasy-infused date movie . it 's hard to really dislike .

the actors are excellent , but the story is not .
like most of these family get-together films , it 's not quirky enough to be interesting or amusing enough to be funny . the drama sometimes weighs as much as mom 's fruitcake .

flawed and reluctant to dig too deep , but also a lyrical , haunting and nerve-wracking portrait: the thinking man 's true-life top gun (with cars) .
the film is a subversive satire that shines a light on the daily inequities that plague us , and the reality that most people simply either overlook , ignore or apathetically accept them .
an ambitious and intelligent film probing that chronic contemporary phenomenon , the seemingly senseless crime , but it is ultimately unsatisfying for all its efforts and various +es .
an incredibly tense , gripping , white-knuckle treat .

reality queen is not trying to be smart of provide any solutions to a problem . it is just trying to make you laugh and it does that at least .
it feels like a cross between errol flynn and monty python .
the use of archival footage is both expertly and ineptly done , the descriptions of the nation 's reaction just doesn 't play true [no one really cares that much-not even president cheney] .
it mixes big laughs with a lot of heart taking a premise built on a group of disparate losers and turning it into a hilarious winner in every way imaginable .
though style ultimately outweighs substance , the film is formidably entertaining .
if nothing else , "beloved sisters" is one of the most visually striking biopics around . too bad you have to wade through so much verbiage in order to enjoy it .
even wiseman , cerebral , perceptive , and a maestro in the editing room , can 't resist urging us , with images if not with words , "just look at them!" and so we do .
the mysteries of pittsburgh is a coming-of-ager that nearly slaughters you by minute 30 with the relentlessness of its protagonist 's voiceovers , as scripted--with reverence and without cinematic wiles--by director rawson marshall thurber .
charlie kaufman is a true original , and while he doesn 't make many films , the ones he has certainly stick in your mind .
less sword and sorcery than f-word and saucery , this is a frequently funny foul-mouthed fantasy adventure with a gleefully puerile script and strong comic performances from mcbride and franco .

while bosworth may be pretty and look good in a bikini , having someone who could actually surf would have brought an authenticity to the film that it badly lacks
christopher plummer 's humbugged-to-the-max take on the immortal miser easily ranks as the most nuanced and memorable interpretation since alastair sim set the gold standard for wrenching , grasping , scraping , clutching , covetous old sinners .
well-acted , visually stunning and initially intriguing , but it quickly falls apart into an uneven , convoluted and unfocused mess that 's neither gripping nor emotionally stirring . its fatal flaw is excessive style over substance .
pure fence-sitting liberal agony is all that 's on offer here , in a muddled and pompous film about america 's war on terror .
it is highly recommended to all lovers of b-cinema--except of course , for those sufficiently well-raised to be proper and socially responsible citizens who prefer to see others of their ilk simulating social norms .
last of a trilogy of films about chilean politics , told through the story of an ad man using positive images to persuade voters to reject a dictator .
it makes even the innocence of an early britney spears tune sound dark , dirty and scary .

it 's hard to dislike a movie in which one of the heroes gets brain power from lemon juice .
diablo cody on steroids
emphatically earns its exclamation mark , but very little rewatch value with this one .
you don 't have to be 13 or 30 to have fun with this entertaining escape .
taken on its own , it 's a mixed bag of grief and visual magic tricks that provides pleasant enough passive viewing , but doesn 't do the greatest job of putting flesh on its characters ' bones .
she 's back , the woman in black , and it does give one pause to wonder if it 's for no better reason than to scare up some more box office lucre .
the best romcom in town .
a flawless piece of classic coen brothers cinema , exquisitely timed and told by all . quite possibly their finest work yet .
more than just the best film of the year , blood is one of cinema 's grandest character studies .
a ham-fisted screenplay sets down the terms of the story with the obviousness of an old-fashioned play .

one of the best australian films in years .the teaming of hogan and michael caton is just sublime .
starting as an intriguing faith-themed thriller , this film quickly descends into gonzo nuttiness .

what eventually keeps laura hillenbrand 's rousing true tale of the downtrodden horse that blossomed into a spectacular champion from galloping into the winner 's circle on screen is its writer-director 's maddening insistence that we be edified and inspired
aronofsky 's most authentic film refuses to ridicule the amateur wrestling circuit , while rourke 's portrait of a has-been will surely be the comeback of the year .
certainly one of the most annoying films of the year . . . [it 's] a movie in which druggies appear to be competing for the title of the most loathsome character .
fascinating account of weiwei 's practice and politics that gives centre stage to his charismatic personality .
[it] leaves us wanting more - more on bulger 's childhood , more on the irish gangs , more on the awful crimes themselves .

it 's kind of like going home .
a flimsy and partial biopic . [full review in spanish]
looks like it has the nugget of a good idea that could have led to a good movie , but this isn 't it .
motel hell retains its own brand of madness by being eerie and holding onto its satirical humour .
. . .while it has its moments of silliness , the central premise of "it 's not nice to fool mother nature" is well developed .
like most horror spinoff sequels , annabelle: creation is a silly , cheap attempt to cash in on a gimmick .
[solid] performances took me over some of the bumps of the movie .
the actors ' flawless performances are nothing short of major achievements . ram is the role rourke was born to play .
i admit i had a good time at next friday . all i 'm saying is , don 't pay more than matinee price for the privilege .
vastly enjoyable despite the syrupy , soppy song bit in the middle (go make a glass of mulled wine during it) . michael caine is perfect in the role and there are many genuine belly laughs .
shazam is an uproarious showcase for the charming levi , with an entertaining and heartwarming final act .
feels like a bone-headed clone of fargo .
ambles on with a lot of perfectly good individual scenes but no real point .
lovely to look at , a semi-chore to sit through , this flick could have used an extra blast of pixie dust .
this comedy mostly gets by on the charms of its cast , but its unfocused , shambling manner saps most of the film 's energy by the time it draws to an unsatisfying conclusion .
anne hathaway and jason sudiekis wonderfully break their usual character types and provide performances that are just as genuine as they are funny .
the melodramatic film has numerous light and comical touches , and the performances are uniformly good . the film 's pace , however , has the consistency of molasses .
by film 's end , marisa swallows her shame and accepts her second-class citizenship with pride while marshall and america learn to love their exotic asset .

it 's quite cheering to encounter such narrative complexity in a mainstream movie .
in coco before chanel , audrey tautou coolly charms as the designer in her formative years . on a scale of 8 , the film is a chanel #5 .
belongs to the realm of theater--"masterpiece theater ." a misdirected-letter movie ? really ? in 2007 ?
wastes its earnest poignancy with a script reliant on corny storytelling clichés .
rocketman is flamboyant and rambunctious and everything elton would be proud of . it 's the musical biopic bohemian rhapsody wants to be when it grows up .
"alita" is just pretty . and pretty horrible .
the scariest aspect of the mind 's eye would be the shrill , hyper-pitched performances that begos ruthlessly extracts from his poor cast members .
how could one hate a film where a giant shark jumps out of the sea and brings down a plane ?
this stale drama is finally getting a limited release and will prove just how limited it is to the poor saps who pay to see it .
it is a scandal that there is no oscar or bafta or golden globe for best dumb fun .
there is some humor (mostly from michael cimino as a well-meaning boyfriend) , and talents galore from both grace and the character she plays to keep conjuring up franchise remnants for years to come .
while portman , along with greta gerwig keep the film lively , 'no strings ' ultimately suffers from unimaginative sequences , blandness and jokes that are not funny at all .
hunnam looks good but can 't do much with the material , for there is not one genuine moment of emotion in the whole laborious mess . even the action scenes are more confusing than stimulating .
energetic and absorbing documentary .
. . .this weird , wacky , weedy medieval adventure ends up mostly putting the "r" back in romp .
atmospheric , with authentic 60s/70s capering all over brazil .
dreamworks ' latest venture into animation is thrilling for children (though too scary for under-sixes) and extremely tolerable for adults .
there 's a lot to like about starfish , but the choppy editing , the overly arthouse way it presents some of the themes , and underdeveloped aspects of the story in favor of the aural experience is ostracizing .
at 125 minutes , it 's a grind that never finds an equilibrium between feel-good comedy and incisive slice of life . and it 's never quite funny enough .
classic arnold , but honestly kinda slow until the final battle . still , it 's arnold versus the alien .
reflecting its conventional storytelling , the birth of a nation relies heavily on civil war-era stereotypes and stock characters , limiting its cast to little to no nuance in their roles .
wow . this is what comic purgatory must look like .
peter rabbit is not just one of the worst films to be released this year , but it 's also a gigantic missed opportunity .
david fincher takes the audience on a breathless , harrowing ride whose considerable pleasures are measured in dread and discomfort .
what a treat it is to see this great actor , after almost 40 years in movies , give a performance that feels both utterly unexpected and completely true .
a meandering , self-indulgent rumination on old age , death and unfulfillable desire , german actor-director vadim glowna 's adaptation of yasunari kawabata 's surreal , ironic short story gets everything but the surrealism and irony right .
director bertrand tavernier has made a stunning film .
a beautiful and often hypnotic film .
it 's the unlikely chemistry between binoche and carell coupled with carell 's impeccable comic timing (watch out for the shower scene) that keeps you glued to the screen .
this dicey melodrama stacks the deck , meaning that buying a ticket is a gamble that doesn 't pay off . rent 'rounders ' instead .
the picture scores highly for tackling tricky , thought-provoking subject matter and contains some humorous and touching moments .
the thrust of the narrative couldn 't be more opaque , but coppola and dp stephen h . burum concoct a unique visual parable on identity , rebellion , and adolescence .

where kim 's best-known movie , the isle , was a stomach-churner , this beautifully composed canvas is the sort of film one falls into , resurfacing at the end with great reluctance .
in salles , screenwriter jose rivera and company 's effort to get the details right , they only get so far . and it 's not quite far enough .
micmacs never bores -- jeunet keeps the pace brisk and the mood ridiculous -- but the movie piles on the whimsy so tirelessly , you eventually start to choke on it .

it 's right there in the credits: we 'll be seeing more of tony stark!
undeniably breezy thanks to a quality star pairing .
this latest one of [waters '] is perhaps his best ever .

an exercise in overwrought style and overwritten melodrama , and proof that a great cast cannot save a film from self-destruction .
meryl streep lets it all hang out as a barroom rocker with family issues in this slight , enjoyable work-out .
often as poignant as it is perverse .
led by charismatic performances and a script that relishes in the goofy humor that made the first film such a hit , face the music is the wholesome dose of pure joy we need right now .
the movie has a mournful electricity , as we come to realize it 's about accepting the inevitable .
[t]he material turns to melodrama , simply so that the resolution can be tied up neatly .
. .the plot stops parodying 'cops ' in favor of general lunacy . the "r" rating allows the humor to get a bit cruder , but gratuitous nudity and sexuality don 't really offer anything new .
it makes independence day look like the muppet movie .

sharp , witty dialogue snappily delivered .
[a] largely witless medieval farrago . . .
a compelling piece of entertainment that poses bigger questions than it answers , slumdog millionaire is a modern version of the cinderella story with some spicy food for thought , and an undeniably sweet core .

the concept is high , the humor lowbrow and the joy of experimentation evident in every frame of this wonderful picture .

pohlad has surrounded himself with award-worthy talent on both sides of the camera , from music supervisor atticus ross to the art department to the stellar cast .
the weight of expectation should have crushed this movie .
[batman begins] feels less like comic fantasy and more like serious drama , albeit one depicting the exploits of a psychotic ninja billionaire .
if you can find a screening which will cut or fast forward any moment when characters are required to speak to one another , it 's a fun movie to watch .
a beautifully poignant epic masterpiece that perfectly depicts the importance of religion and how far you 'll go to maintain your beliefs .
weird horror isn 't as rewarding as scary or creepy , and the ring two is definitely one of the bigger disappointments of late .
as this long , 123-minute movie wraps up , the phrase "for life" begins to sound uneasily like a sentence .
'the master ' is another tale of warped power and fanatical delusions , and it sees anderson on captivating form as a director who is able to surprise and impress with scene after scene .
filmed by cinematographer salvatore totino on the foothills of everest as well as the italian alps , everest drops us in the white beauty of the mountain and its myriad dangers at every step .
an imperfect film that just misses a chance at greatness , dead again aims for hitchcock , but comes nearer brian de palma .
meyers couldn 't resist living up to her predisposed reputation with an ending so false that it 's almost indescribable .
starting as a clever contagion-style investigative thriller , this fiercely paced apocalyptic adventure begins to fall apart early on when smart logic is jettisoned for the more visceral thrills of seeing brad pitt save the planet .
[starbuck] is a quirky little charmer .
the best thing i can say about this film is that i can 't wait to see what the director does next .
it 's all very wrong , but , strangely enough , also quite right .
'richard jewell ' is an eastwood gem .
the film tantalizes and seduces you into a world that is mysterious but , for the most part , completely arresting .
it 's perhaps one credibility-straining twist too many for the film , which up until then does a solid job of aping slicker , bigger-budgeted hollywood thrillers .
[t]he movie as a whole suggests the 40-year-old franchise is finally showing its age .
this film is gritty , raw and unseemly , and while jamie bell rightfully dominates and carries the picture , vera farmiga delivers the best performance .

good morning , vietnam proved that robin williams could act and be hilariously funny in the same film .
robin hood does feel very much a product of its time , with fun performances and kinetic action thrown into the mix , it feels as if it had to crib from another landmark franchise to do so .
this brainless and soulless throwback to exploitation cinema occasionally entertains but mostly just makes you root for carnivorous fish to do away with everyone involved .
there 's a lovely loose feel to what we did on our holiday , partly down to the fact that while the adult characters have tightly scripted dialogue the child actors were allowed a good deal of leeway .
it all sounds terribly murky , but few filmmakers are as gifted at making you want to peer through the murk .

director neil jordan 's return to the vampire genre is bloody and atmospheric , but at heart , it 's about a girl who just desperately needs someone to listen to her .
better than average elvis vehicle .
dickie is intense in her screen debut , which requires her to be in nearly every scene . the supporting cast is strong , and robbie ryan 's handheld camera provides gritty ambiance for this taut thriller .
the bravura acting is unsupported by a script that 's content to settle for the dramatic equivalent of english comfort food , with moments of pathos and whimsy doled out like spoonfuls of dough and treacle .
an entertaining enough offbeat crime comedy/drama featuring an amazing cast - led by the grizzled , shuffling , mumbling , wisecracking old dog playing the lead .
more than just a nostalgic meal at shrinking number of genuine jewish delis in n .america , latest delicious foodie doc where restaurants illuminate ethnic/national cultures .
the cloying , bliss-out pantheism that featured in the tree of life is virtually the only feature in malick 's new film .
the film suggests the viewer see the proceedings in two ways , as a believer might and as an unbeliever might . this makes it really two films .
craven knows how to set up a couple of good fright shots , but this odd mix of genres yields very little that 's really scary and even less that 's funny .
whether you 're among the 46 ,520 kickstarter contributors or an avowed member of the anti-braff brigade , you may just find yourself trying to stifle a sniffle .

entertaining and provocative enough .
it 's a nice-looking film , particularly for an independent animated film , but there 's just no spark there to elevate beyond something anyone over 8 years old will appreciate .

where romero moved straight into the socio-political criticism (especially the heavy-handed and talky anti-military stuff) , eisner concentrates more on moving the plot along quickly and creating memorable suspense scenes .
these are some big space shoes to fill . but hey , give the new han some room to grow--to become solo--and he grows on you .
from the off you know you 're in great hands . this isn 't your typical churned out war movie: this is war and you 're in it . nolan completely immerses the audience in the soldiers ' world .

a high-calibre hollywood prestige drama , sharp and sobering , with top-drawer work from lancaster , clift and sinatra .
i 'm not saying he-man deserved all that brilliant of a movie . . . but this thing 's a freaking disaster .
a bloated , confusing , and terribly bland thriller .

when it 's over . . .we have to wonder why any of it mattered in the first place .

a tedious film with an utterly unlikable protagonist .
writer-director richard tanne , at times , creates banter between the pair worthy of a spencer tracy-katharine hepburn exchange .

the true story behind the birth of the mcdonald 's fast food empire is the alluring basis for an absolutely ripping , fact-based yarn that is surely oscar bound .

a war thriller that will interest the lovers of the genre without having a prodigy in it . [full review in spanish]
golden door belongs to(vincenzo) amato (respiro) . he makes this tale of woe and wonderment the charmer it turns out to be .

there is wonderful chemistry of two quite different kinds between tom cruise and cameron diaz on the one hand , and cruise and penelope cruz on the other .
witty , menacing and steamy (in every sense) , the beguiled is an intelligent update and coppola 's best work to date . oscars await .

banek is one of the more complex characters affleck has attempted , but the performance comes off flat and uninvolving .

wow . i mean , really -- wow!
this version moves like a freight train , but suffers from a debilitating charm deficit .
in the factory-farmed blandness of the movies , happy-go-lucky has a strong , real taste .
it 's an enjoyably absurd and absurdly enjoyable extravaganza , both delirious and surrealist .

embrace of the serpent is an excellent handcrafted narrative about the amazonian shaman karamakate and his meeting with two scientists between 1909 and 1940 .
hidalgo is the sort of old-fashioned popcorn entertainment that has become increasingly rare on the current movie scene .
every bit as quirky , engaging and rebellious as the artwork it aims to celebrate . sadly , it also shares graffiti 's tendency to be energetic but scattergun and ephemeral .
the rise of skywalker ends this saga with a resounding thud .
much like martin scorsese 's the wolf of wall street or michael bay 's pain & gain , this hyperkinetic real-life tale boils down to dudes just being dudes .

it 's a slickly-made , compelling story about a headhunter with a taste for swapping art masterpieces with forgeries in order to fund a lavish lifestyle for a wife who wants babies when he doesn 't .
a romantic comedy that manages to be cute without sending viewers barrelling into the bathroom to toss their cookies .
a pleasing and pretty enough re-run , just that bit diminished .
besides references to ritualistic patterns and symbols , there are scary , furtive appearances and characters airing guilt and resentment in an oppressive environment .
rampage aspires to little more than lobotomised escapism . go in expecting unashamed popcorn fodder and it delivers in kaiju-sized quantities .

exactly what you 'd expect . and that 's not a good thing .

it 's russell crowe 's unhinged performance that 's the crown jewel of weirdness in this joyously bizarre little action movie .

low-level tarantino inspires exploration , but delivers little more than a blood bath .

a grey , dull experience , with faris 's talents wasted and restricted to raised eyebrows and chin squeezes .

a tightly-wound story that screams out for second-helpings , with relic , natalie erika james makes her voice heard and sets her out as a director to watch .
the resident evil films are not everyone 's bag , although they seem to be evolving into their own brand of hyper-stylized cheese , made more extreme with each outing .
what 's more fascinating about this widespread entanglement is how it relates to the movie 's at-best questionable but more-likely nonexistent moral core .

it holds up , it 's just a good movie . . .
idiotic movie , even by werewolf standards .
perhaps "logan lucky" is best appreciated as a stealth commentary on tough times in america . it takes a director of soderbergh 's gifts to actually make that funny .
say what you will about keanu reeves , he knows his strengths . so for his first directorial effort , he chose to do a martial-arts flick with a postmodern tinge .
as prodigious a talent as prince was , he only altered the funk . the megalithic , trail-blazing talent of james brown birthed it . and chadwick boseman nails the telling of it .

. . .diehard fans will get something out of this repast .

'shows the consequences of what we have done in the past and the danger of where we are heading '
conrad hall 's oscar-nominated photography is as impressive as the acting , with young max pomeranc , himself a top-ranking player , upstaging the likes of joe mantegna , laurence fishburne and ben kingsley .

a tenacious , brutal drama that dares you to turn your back .
the glass house es una cinta de suspenso que conjunta un buen elenco , pero por desgracia el guin cae en lo ilgico en varias ocasiones .
arnold schwarzenegger gets one of his most complex roles yet in this messy , violent thriller , another trip to the dark side for filmmaker david ayer .
roma is made of the stuff of memory , and is the kind of film you don 't forget .
though you 're expecting the predictable ending , the finale , and what goes on before it , feels phoney and contrived , while a vulgar mean streak throughout only further puts you off .

it 's hard to imagine charlie 's angels satisfying anyone , let alone its female-centric target demographic .
high-tech ghost story takes a grip until credibility goes into orbit .
the two of them are good here , but theyíre both capable of so much more . they elevate this mediocre material , but hereís hoping the pair meet again onscreen with characters and situations worthy of them .
. . .the movie was never meant to be a horror film; it was meant to be a character study and morality play .
if a lump of coal was once the symbol of a worthless holiday gift , it 's now a ticket to eight crazy nights .
a cerebral trip with jung and freud , sex and cigars , the talking cure and adventures beyond .
if fear and desire is uneven and sometimes reveals an experimental rather than a polished exterior , its over-all effect is entirely worthy of the sincere effort put into it .
friday night lights is a film about football , but it shares more in common with films from the horror genre than with its predecessors .
too unsexy for a date movie , too much fingering for a see-with-your-mum movie .
i wish the comedian were more focused . as it ponders issues of ageism and talent in the age of social media and viral videos , it may never gel , but it does resound .

while i get the feeling morris could be a terrific young talent worth keeping an eye on , she 's practically the only reasons to care about anything that 's happening here .
this bond is rough and raw . . . despite his divinely piercing blue eyes , he might just as well have emerged from primordial sludge to do the bidding of beelzebub .
jake gyllenhaal is focused , intense and terrifying .
this is an extraordinary film , a unique film , the kind of film that reminds us of the true power of science fiction to comment on our society .
all we can do is hope that films such as hotel rwanda remind us all -- moviegoer and politician -- of the terrible cost of doing nothing .
the writers and directors make it work by never losing sight of the spirit of the characters , world , and milne: imagination , innocence , and heaps of heart .
i 'll take blood diamond over lethal weapon 5 any day . let 's call it a flawed gem .
a bit rubbish , but enjoyable none the less .
generates a decent amount of suspense before totally self-destructing with a preposterous ending that 's also a shameless setup for the inevitable saw iii .

like its alien star , the new "the thing" mimics its prey slavishly - yet still can 't quite reproduce its spark of life .
the film 's generic nature extends to everything about it: the unengaging cinematography , haphazard editing , emptily jaunty score , even use of locations .
despite that off-putting one-sheet poster of ryan reynolds in a fat suit , the movie is actually pretty good -- funny , smart and featuring a host of appealing performances .
saddled with an egregiously thin premise and woefully underdeveloped characters . . .
the subtle intelligence of this film is reflective in the title itself . by employing the words 'all right , ' we are alerted to the fact that this film , however unique , addresses a sense of normalcy .
despite its hollywood-friendliness , departures never seems less than an utterly sincere , four-hankie movie about finding oneself .
the film 's less-than-engrossing atmosphere is compounded by wysocki 's competent yet charmless performance . . .
on-screen chemistry between two magnetic leads can overcome a lot in a film , but it can 't mask questionable screenwriting .

for those who think there 'e nothing funnier than yokels acting like idiots for 90 minutes straight .
you know you 're in trouble when the main question a movie raises is 'which of these characters do i want to slap most ? '
a reasonably taut story of political intrigue , international corruption and one woman 's determined fight for justice
i call this a typical summer-house movie: films stars do because they fancy a fourth home in napa .
an unfocused and contrived drama that lacks a palpable emotional core , but john malkovich 's raw performance makes it at least marginally engaging .
the digital effects , including many of the fight scenes , are terrible -- terrible!!!
the comedic magic that wilson and vaughn brought to the screen when paired up in the 2005 hit "wedding crashers" seems to have dwindled . their interactions are still fun to watch , just not as funny .

basically a series of skits that are barely tethered to a plot , this works better than expected , thanks primarily to martin 's infectious performance .

the summer blockbuster we 've been waiting for .
delicious lunacy from start to finish
it 's good , but it 's far from allen 's best film .
what the movie boils down to is a rather queasy rumination on good science vs . bad science , good faith vs . bad faith .
. . . not for all tastes but far from flavorless .
this is the result of a fan culture that puts the past on a pedestal . the best we can hope for are echoes of our original experience .
shazam! succeeds with a pure heart . [full review in spanish]
the most condensed and purified expression of the starry-eyed optimistic humanism that defined all of henson 's best work .
between leonardo dicaprio 's brilliant lead performance and terrence winter 's excellent script , it 's without a doubt the funniest movie that scorsese has ever directed .
why , after nearly 90 minutes of splattering limbs , cat-fighting hookers and characters gleefully being set afire , does carnahan suddenly decide to veer into operatic michael mann territory ?
the fourth and final entry in michael winterbottom 's trip film series is darker still and more melancholy than the previous pics , despite the gorgeous locations .

to mention carlos reygadas ' winsome silent light in the same breath as key directors carl theodor dreyer , andrei tarkovsky , robert bresson , and the more recent bruno dumont is not hyperbole .
a welcome respite from the decreasing quality of clint eastwood 's recent filmography .

an indian muslim in queen victoria 's court
an infectiously goofy film , but also deceptively smart about why we love comic book heroes and the amount of stupidity we 're willing to accept within the genre .

more fun from the director of not quite hollywood . a total blast .

whatever magic between chan and tucker that [ratner] was able to inadvertently capture the first two times around is finally swallowed up in the black hole that is his non-talent .
a closer look shows all the deep and heartfelt emotion just under the surface of anthony hopkins , underrewarded in one of the finest roles of his career .
the film has a firm grasp on what makes compelling drama . . . and it wraps up with a poignancy that i wasn 't prepared for .
this movie is just not funny in any way .
hill effortlessly blends state of the art cgi with winning animation .
it 's not exactly breaking news , but the british comic certainly has fun going for broke .
ultimately , red dragon is all about the cannibal , and hopkins , with his unblinking stare and gracious manner , slips into the role like a favorite cardigan .
herzog 's longing for the ideological purity in which these lives are lived , free of paperwork and bureaucracy , taxes and technology , drives the film , which lacks an overall story arc .
the editing . . . matches mcqueen 's evolution as a person quite well , beginning with the breathlessness of a young art punk and slowing down to adult introspection .
the citizen kane of teen cancer tearjerkers , alfonso gomez-rejon 's funny and bruising sundance sensation is like the fault in our stars remade for criterion collection fetishists .
the final scenes are both ambiguous and terrifying , and they left a preview audience as shaken as any i 've seen .
chaplin 's greatest comedy is also his most recognizable .
it 's a prequel , it 's a sequel , and it 's in no way equal to the movie that came before .
"arbitrage" becomes far more complex than just dramatized anti-corporate polemic , or even a simple fall from grace .
hotel mumbai is a non-stop intense thrill ride that will shake you to the core .
it 's an absolute delight .
terrific but intense mix of love , friendship , fear , sorrow .
this is a naive director with so little insight you wonder what comic books he 's been reading .
just this week 's kiddie-flick cash grab . how you 'll explain to your tykes why you 've stuffed and roasted reggie in a few weeks is your concern .
[ridley scott] has few peers at keeping a complex script clear and tightly focused . . .
balancing slapstick and the anything-but-funny , the film is not without wobbles . as with any high wire act , those are half the point .
frozen is horrifying and brutal at times but without ever losing sight of important things like creating characters you really care about whether they live or die .
a film for anyone who 's ever been in love or had a boss; forget the credit crunch and take out a lease on this apartment right now .
whatever happened to cuba gooding jr . 's career ?
intense , ambiguous and exciting , rod lurie 's remake of peckinpah 's psychological thriller keeps you transfixed with terror .

a slick , provocative and timely biopic about one of hip hop 's most iconic groups .
a 'life-affirming ' tale about life imprisonment , the shawshank redemption is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that is easily overvalued in an era of diminishing expectations .
you connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures . the result: a true sunken treasure .

bolt 's double identity allows young viewers to imagine the fun of owning a cuter version of krypto while it also affirms charles m . schulz 's assertion that happiness is a warm puppy . . .

a delightfully strange hybrid creature .
. . .understands all of the emotional and procedural pitfalls and pain [of divorce] with complexity and clarity .
as revivals go , this one is well-above-average by dint of its intelligent reappraisal of major elements in the first movie .
even if this wasn 't ledger 's final role before his untimely death last year , his joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time .
ceylan displays pure , exhilarating mastery in this film: it is made with such confidence and flair .
pretty cool flick .
one of the year 's best , with crossover potential along the lines of cyrano de bergerac and il postino . given its quirky heart , it might well surpass them all .
it 's ripe with zingers .
much is suggested , little explained , but the childhood of a leader is rich with allegorical meaning and we 're left with plenty to chew on between elliptical episodes .
you may feel the urge to laugh out of sheer need to break the tension , and polanski knows it .
although the story is slight , the film leaves viewers with a lasting , haunting impression .
it 's deceptively simple , but it does so much so well . it 's heartbreaking by the end . . .it 's just really , really powerful .
it sounds like slight stuff but hansen-love is an expert in the observational -- the habits and customs that make up a life and the sense of dislocation that results when they 're no longer possible .
informative and illuminating .
driver and duchovny shine in romance with heart .
this sober drama limning the roots of the artist 's inspiration and his ruthless ambition provides the great philip seymour hoffman with one of his best roles yet .
the burden of catholic guilt has been a mainstay of the religion but the experience of german fundamentalist catholic guilt is suffocating in the superb film
besides the sloppy editing of the 1st and 2nd act , count me in for any slave movie where the black people fight back!
it 's badly directed , poorly edited , and features some of the most unconvincing acting this side of a soup commercial .
a young and talented cast put energy into this timeless story of the citizen warriors of occupied france .
as if in imitation of the ruthless mexican drug cartel its heroes go after , director stefano sollima 's sequel decapitates , disembowels , and castrates denis villeneuve 's beautiful , tough , and sad 2015 original .
the last samurai looks perfect . along with being visually stunning , the movie is peppered with a bouncy sense of humor and a handful of thrilling battle scenes .
a different kind of western - somber , reflective and set in the elevated plains and salt flats of bolivia .

we get the predictable plot points - storms , sharks , close calls with passing ships - but it feels like a uniquely handmade artifact .
pitt dials this hitman down a few notches , keeping the guy as realistic as the movie around him .
the hangdog expression is riven with pain , and [banderas] plays mallo as emotionally cauterised yet beneath it all still desperate to connect , to love and to make more films .
if you didn 't like ride along , do you really think ride along 2 is the movie that rights all of the past wrongs ?
while it doesn 't excuse hollywood and their tendency to prefer the established property over a new idea , at least they 're getting better at making the reboots watchable .
one of the brightest , giddiest and most outlandishly exciting of all the disney studio 's recent major feature cartoons .
it 's smooth and competently crafted , an efficient thriller punctuated by startling bursts of violence and nuanced performances from norton , whose tough-cop routine masks a sort of cerebral tenderness , and the ever-reliable noah emmerich .
it 's rare to see a protagonist who 's so gently human , so righteously patriotic , and so believable , making "bridge of spies" one of the most striking spy movies ever made .
perhaps some comedians aren 't meant for the big screen .
a thrilling suspenser that wisely puts the lovely sobieski front-and-center , where she belongs .

a hugely likeable , perfectly judged parody that provides empowering action and embarrassing incidents in equal measure .
just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years .
a b movie treated like an a movie that mostly ends up being a zzzzzzzzzz movie .
coco delivers heartwarming storytelling and eye-catching visuals , all the while honouring the power of family and music .
chavela is a film about the power of one woman 's music that is every bit as emotional as the songs she made legendary . you definitely won 't forget the name chavela vargas after watching this .

a sweet movie from a sweet director .
a deeply involving film where intentions are as cryptic as the title , and the reckoning of past sins opens fresh wounds .
the familiar contagion plotline prevents the film from achieving the allegorical charm or cautionary impact of the 1968 original .

"next cut" a welcome reunion .
a solid drama about pettiness , individualism and foolishness . [full review in spanish]
jessica chastain is a shining star with acting skills that resonate beyond her beauty . she is at her fierce , unerring best , which is saying something , in the disappearance of eleanor rigby .
it 's an entertaining movie; but to an extent it 's also a public service , in that it persuades the audience to think about an issue it might never have previously considered .
absolutely awe-inspiring , it manages to be almost as naturally funny as it is uplifting . it offers viewers a nearly perfect 'you are there ' experience .
huge bears , cute bears , stunning vistas and an age-old story of survival , the g-rated "bears" is fine entertainment for families and animal lovers .
the confession exhibits signs of post-masterpiece fatigue , though it makes up for some of it with sheer gutsiness .
[a] calculated , derivative attempt to turn a decades-old piece of junk culture into a new pile of box-office cash .
kirby dick 's spartan use of graphics and statistics conveys arguments with little grandstanding .
shoplifters tells a story about love , family , crime , and truth . it 's life itself without the morality cloak . one of the best movies of 2018 . [full review in spanish]
the music , the chemistry between houston and washington , and minor characters that make us smile make this film worth watching-especially around christmas , when this is set .
if ever there was a critic-proof film , this is most certainly it - but , pleasingly , it 's so good that it doesn 't have to be .
likeable leads , sparkling dialog , a story that is more than a rack to hang cliches from , competent direction , and an ending that doesn 't insult my intelligence .
the ending is never really in doubt , but how rio gets there makes the most of its giddy sort of mayhem .
"tbd-1" is smartly directed by bill condon ("gods and monsters ," "dreamgirls") in a straight forward manner that keeps the film from bogging down in its last act .
with terrence howard 's performance providing the hook , [director] brewer provides a flow of schemes , dreams and rap rhymes that take us on a journey inside a man 's soul .
un clsico
the film is grounded in the arcs of its beloved characters and presents some exciting new ones , fun settings , and funny dialogue .
cédric klapisch 's passion for wine gives the film an authenticity that usually accompanies a documentary . viewers get a behind-the-scenes look at the process while getting familiarized with the story 's rich characters .
ellis ' book , though a grim read , had a satirical edge to it that made it darkly enjoyable; the movie is simply dark and dull . and vampireless , more 's the pity .
as fascinating as it is frustrating
what emerges is a kind of comic thriller about the insult of having hard work ignored or heartlessly omitted , as wintour does to several images from one of coddington 's photo shoots .
john sayles ' "lone star" contains so many riches , it humbles ordinary movies .
it may never generate an epic scale , but that 's only because it stays so relentlessly intimate .
this isn 't a great horror movie so much as a fun thrill ride .
this is a really tremendous movie . from the bold concept to elliott 's performance , it 's just a deliciously full cinematic meal .
it turns out to be the goofy and action-packed antidote to most of the summer 's blockbusters .
an animated sequel that , despite not achieving the inspired lunacy of the first movie where gru literally steals the moon , is smartly calculated to deliver squeals to kids and amusement to accompanying adults .
imaginative , inventive and exciting , brad bird 's sequel is fun family fare .
by turns sorrowful , sardonic and histrionic , mirren 's sofya is always wonderfully , sloppily human .
roman polanski . sadomasochism . what could possibly go wrong ?
a quality comedy , one filled with first-rate gags , and the three main young actors are very talented (living life fearless)
the jackass stunts are at least outrageous and disgusting , eliciting much stronger reactions . nitro cirtus is equally dumb , and much duller to boot .
a premise worthy of richard matheson , without his depth . . . [full review in spanish]
under [hallstrom 's] direction , something to talk about seems volatile and fresh , as well as tender and sentimental .
this is intelligent , intimate , lived-in drama that packs a startling punch .
a dizzying shout-out to those who believe there 's only one answer for everything , whether it be faith , political principles or love .
subtlety and thematic complexity aren 't iñárritu 's strengths , so when the revenant lets go of its "big ideas" and focuses on glass ' manhunt , things get really good .
philophobia: or the fear of falling in love has a little something for everyone .
stations of the cross appears to acknowledge the miraculous , even as it descends into hell on earth .
famous for its allure as an audience-participation event , this adaptation of the stage musical works just fine as a solo viewing at home , with no resultant diminishment of its highlights .
stlick , stylish and ineffably cool , this was perhaps mcqueen 's defining role . also mention goes to the uncreditied star of the film; san francisco .
savage grace doesnâ(tm)t seem quite sure of how to communicate its own fascination with such doings , whether to convey shock , envy , pity or bemusement .
i am not going to try to explain the story- after watching this movie i may never try to explain another story ever again .
despite the contained setting , the film has an epic quality , as well as a romantic intensity that marks a major leap forward from sciamma 's previous films tomboy and water lillies .
it 's as much about the unfocused feelings of vengeful rage many americans had after 9/11 as about a woman going on a killing spree .
overall , a welcome addition to the living dead cycle .
while the premise of the director 's follow-up . . . is promising , he botches the execution at every turn , leaving his cast to drift aimlessly among half-baked plot points .
there are a few very funny moments in this thankfully short 77 minutes , but nowhere near enough ideas or gags to sustain a feature-length version of this tv show .
the replacement killers is as abstract as a jazz instrumental , and as cool and self-assured .
carpenter can 't cloak the hilarity of this hoary horror tale .
a full package period romance , from the performances to the costumes to the lush setting and the rich score .
a 3-d thriller that misses the mark thanks to a mediocre screenplay and undeveloped characters .
it is a creative and aesthetic masterpiece .
andrew haigh 's deliberate and moving study of a youth adrift with a horse as much in need as he is hits the mark . charlie plummer is terrific .
the film 's high-end performances breathe with naturalism , aided no doubt by the use of improvised dialogue and the absence of histrionics . even when things get tense , voices rarely get loud . and woodley is terrific .
from the production values to the savvy delivery of its christian message , soul surfer is a champ .
the fresh-faced actors , realistic dialogue and naturalistic performances suggest a casual approach , but as the story progresses , the filmmaker 's control is increasingly evident .
the kind of movie that will have a far longer shelf life than most of the largely disposable big summer blockbusters dwarfing it at the box office .
rust and bone is an incredibly well crafted and intensely emotionally absorbing film worthy of serious attention .
havard , a newcomer , isn 't a powerhouse , but she conveys essential goodness and brings a natural quality to kris . she and morgan share understated winning chemistry .
the actors are having a lot of fun , and the production values of the musical numbers are slick and high-spirited .
the inspirational part becomes a letdown in the finale (when the movie tells us , as gently as possible , about moriarity 's life after mavericks) , but moriarity 's good-natured determination shines through .
. . .probably the granddaddy of all so-bad-it 's-good cult films . i 'm not sure it started a welcome trend .
an impressive and praiseworthy work which , with luck and some due broad-mindedness on the part of audiences , should ably join the pantheon of previous adaptations .
a beautiful mind is at its best when its subject is at his worst .
an art-house animal house .
heralds the launch of a new big-screen comedy axis to challenge wright , pegg and frost - we can 't wait to see what king and co . come up with next .
it 's fun to watch fabulous-looking , confident people trying to finesse each other into a corner .
a masterpiece of dystopian science fiction on film .
a satirical joy , due mainly to the performances of reese witherspoon as tracy , matthew broderick as mcallister , chris klein as paul and , especially , jessica campbell as tammy .
an ordinary movie about a girl and her horse , but dakota fanning makes the difference .
while laughter may not be the intended entertainment value , you have to admit orphan does entertain . isn 't that what really counts ?
mark has outgrown kurt the way kurt has outgrown his clothes , but they 're both happy for an escape , each one numb from aging past simpler times that fostered their friendship .
gareth edwards ' take on the classic monster franchise has much of what a great blockbuster should , and i wonder if it won 't be a jurassic park for millennial teenagers .
the final 40 minutes of [godzilla] are worth the price of admission alone , even if you might have to jar yourself awake a few times on the way to it .
amistad tells a compelling story and it tells it well .
"cameraperson" testifies to a world in which it would be clear to see that we 're all connected , if only we took the time to look at one another with reverence and simply listen .
the uplifting turn of the story likely is complete fiction , but it 's heart-tugging , joyful fiction , lifted to the highest heights by a lovely song or two and thompson 's career-capping performance .
a documentary narrated by john leguizamo that provides a seldom-seen look inside the training camps run by mlb in that impoverished nation .
so brainless it 's a wonder it can find its own ending .
twisty substantial thriller , faithfully adapted from a standout bbc mini-series . it 's not as exceptional as its source but the changes implemented mostly enhance rather than harm the story .
exploring an array of themes ranging from love and betrayal to morality and mortality , eastern promises is a mesmerizing thriller designed for folks with a penchant for lingering depictions of utter depravity . sheer brutality as cinematic beauty .
rowling 's prose unwittingly resembles the monster books that try to eat the students .
dujardin and lellouche are great here .
after fearlessly diving into a character that 's self-centered , wretched , and downright degrading , quaid outdoes most of his earlier works of cinema .
director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .
when it 's orchestrating the central mystery , it 's like a well-oiled thrill machine .
hey , why didn 't they make monster movies like this when i was a kid ?
the movie delivers all of the expected action beats , but what it does better than perhaps any of the previous spider-man films is capture the humor and sense of fun from the comics .
as bad an idea as it is to eat before seeing it , you probably won 't be very hungry (at least not for fast food) afterwards either .
if denzel washington isn 't the coolest dude out there , i don 't know who is .
an off-centre rom-com with unlikely stars , this indie drama is neither too funny nor too romantic in its balance of laughs and tenderness . the perfect date movie for middle-aged romantics (and we mean that as a compliment) .
but even though the spider-man franchise lifecycle moves at a speed that would impress fruit flies , at least quality hasn 't been sacrificed in the name of expediency .
steve martin is at the height of his comic powers in this very un-pc comedy .
visually striking .
this ode to a bygone style of entertainment is a fitting swan song for altman .
the kindest , warmest , bravest , most selfless movie i 've ever known .
it 's only jenkins ' second feature , but moonlight feels more like a hard-earned career-capper rather than the career-igniter that it should become .
the actors are certainly game to be as strong as ever in their vocal performances , which has toy story 4 working effectively as an animated character study , but the film is also flat-out hysterical .
[a] calculated , derivative attempt to turn a decades-old piece of junk culture into a new pile of box-office cash .
with words from shakespeare and spenser and music from jimmy somerville , this is a kaleidoscopic celebration of albion . or an art-house highlander , if you prefer .
this gorgeous little movie is sure to be beloved by your little people , who may discover what it means to find a magical beauty in the things we can 't altogether see .
lush costumes and gorgeous sets highlight this tale of 19th century social climber , becky sharp .
not really memorable except for the fact that it was a box-office failure , even the performances of the two comedy stars can 't save it from itself .
your heart will break , but it will also swell .
natalie portman 's performance carries the film entirely .
black 's performance carries the movie .
tatum in particular is a huge surprise . he 's always been a pretty face , but here (as in his recent snl outing) he displays comedic chops we never saw coming .
. . .absolutely compelling . . .
further proof that the coens can take any genre -- in this case , a star-driven screwball comedy -- and make it work without sacrificing their unique sensibility in the process .
. . .a terrific piece of moviemaking--thoughtful , poignant , funny , and uplifting .
mylan and shenk provide an engrossing look at these bright , clean-cut young men and the obstacles they faced in 'the land of plenty . '
the charming knuckleball finds something universal here , about obsession , talent , perseverance and , rarest of all , good sportsmanship .
a most wanted man concludes on a bleakly prescient note , not only in offering an extraordinarily trenchant critique of american foreign policy but also as a moody send off to hoffman himself .
movies like the kids are all right -- beautifully written , impeccably played , funny and randy and true -- don 't come along very often .
even though it 's a film with a pov , it 's very well done with fine acting by everyone . it 's up to the viewer how much to believe .

two great classic silent comedies
lipstick is a nasty little item masquerading as a bold statement .
enthralling thriller with lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the end as the tension and drama rise .
true classic bogie and bacall , even though plot is way out puzzling in many ways .
dave franco 's exasperating horror/thriller , burdened by a disturbing , frustrating conclusion .
bresson outdoes nearly every escape film you 've ever seen , using little more than the face of francois leterrier and elemental off-screen sound .
yes , fences suffers somewhat from the bare-bones transferal of the "action" from stage to screen but the material is so compelling that viewers can easily lose sight of the movie 's "play nature ."
it is at this point that we must ask ourselves , how much of a good thing is too much ?
for those who love a grand spy mystery , a wild chase , and a harrowing portrait of an innocent man struggling to prove his innocence while the world turns inexplicably against him , the 39 steps is ideal .
a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze .
it looks closely , burrows deep , considers the way in which lives have become pointless and death therefore less meaningful .
plenty of punches get thrown in the protector , but most left me numb .
an intellectual exercise in which you 're never given all the variables to solve the problem - and then you find your calculator was on acid the whole time anyway .
little nicky can never get past the vibe that the whole thing was an excuse for sandler to give work to his friends so they could riff on the set .
flags of our fathers is one of the best movies of the year , one which will be hard to ignore come the academy award nominations .
george bailey and bedford falls never looked so good!
a spare but earth-shattering film .
bad neighbours is . . . a thumping , screaming , appallingly moronic comedy that will make anyone with a working pair of ears and eyes never want to see a film again .
this is a showing movie , not a telling movie: the bond between the lovings is all in their body language .
an outstanding courtroom drama , and easily the best adaptation of one of john grisham 's legal thrillers .
this movie hated me from the opening scene; two hours later , the feeling was more than mutual .
bong joon ho 's cannes film festival winner is a flat out masterpiece .
you have to see this new film called catfish . only problem is , i can 't tell you why . which , admittedly , makes this review useless .
this negligible comedy might as well come with a bouncing ball so members of the audience can recite the dialogue along with the actors .
a pointless exercise in cool by a film maker who needs to grow up . as in: oh , grow up .
few debuts come punchier , cooler , and more influential than louis malle 's 1958 thriller about a parisian murder plan unravelling , scene by fateful scene .
a poignant tale of undying love!
replicates the experience of viewing an arcade demo for the same length of time .
a serious treatment of the superman comics . . .

gillespie walks a fine line in mining both the buffoonish nature of the crime and the deep sadness of harding 's rise and fall , and mostly pulls it off .

shot in intense close-ups , the better to study the emotions burning off the characters ' skin , the film is all talk and gestures , but it begins to take your breath away like a chase movie would .

the re-release is keenly timed with the 100th anniversary of the actual sinking of the rms titanic , yet another factor to validate the 3d film 's existence .
merely (and literally) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .

one of ridley scott 's better films in years features one of matt damon 's best performances .
it 's a bit sad to see this talented , oscar-winning actor reduced to taking murphy 's cast-off parts , but gooding does fine with what the movie gives him .

this movie doesn 't play; it just lies there , waiting to be kicked around by anyone unfortunate enough to have shelled out good money to see it .
these aren 't characters , these are character templates , and the story they 've been cut-and-pasted into couldn 't be more cornball .
still stands on its own as an intriguing and chilling example of how horror works best when the characters and the audience don 't have to be lobotomized .
lo and behold is beautifully shot , its outdoor landscapes so vibrant and verdant one can almost smell them , its indoor spaces cool and shining yet welcoming as kubrick made them .
sheer boredom , unless you 're under the age of 7 .
if you 're missing the rush you get from a great , fun summer movie , bundle up , go watch red and have a blast .
a strange and funny film , smart , complex and difficult to shake .
what have audiences done to deserve this ? summer 2010 has been a roundly disappointing season for movies , but no major release so far has been as brazenly low-rent as killers .
this film from russia about a child 's dream of love and family is poignant and genuine enough to earn classic status .
atlas shrugged is a passionless experience that feels like a tv movie/miniseries . it 's flat , poorly plotted , thinly performed and dull to its core
an incredible independent drama .
greengrass has achieved such immediacy that it 's hard to believe that what we 're watching isn 't really unfolding before our eyes .
one of the finest ever committed to celluloid!
brimstone sucks . there 's nothing good about it , from the acting to the writing . and what 's bad is made worse by the long runtime .
into darkness it should go , where no one can see it .
the killing of a sacred deer is a film of brutal morality , or guilt and cowardice , and full of terrific performances .
a romantic comedy whose quirkiness is complemented by italicized exposition .
how do you borrow the best elements of the transporter , the karate kid and mission impossible and end up with an unwatchable mess like this ?

midsommar is truly a masterful work of art that only comes around every 90 years or so .
after witnessing firsthand the pleasures of amelie poulain 's little world , i realized its oddball sense works greatly in the movie 's favor .
transformers isn 't just dorky , it 's gloriously dorky .
manages a sense of genuine poignancy that never becomes sticky or sentimental
fritz lang 's acute use of objects , symbols , letters , and codes to decrypt a relatively simple narrative remains as perfect an example of pure cinema in the sound era as one is likely to find .
it 's just about conceivable that somebody who has never seen a spy thriller might find some enjoyment in american assassin .
moore is endlessly watchable .
a fresh review about the 60s hollywood . a change in the film industry . a tarantino 's film like no other [full review in spanish]
a gem of a film .
it 's not every movie that would announce its shortcomings right in its title .
michelle williams , near the very end , [says what] feels like the most sincere heartfelt thing anyone says in the entire movie: "i 'm sorry about venom ."
a surreally dopey comedy that is refreshingly ribald without resorting to gross-out humor , and its '70s-savvy soundtrack may be worth the price of admission .
for all its wandering , this is a very deliberate , masterful , and ultimately very touching movie .
not a frame is wasted in this taut , superbly directed , masterfully acted film .
if twilight made you queasy and dark shadows felt like a missed opportunity , this pitch-perfect genre spoof is worth relishing .
all in all , one hour photo is an outstanding showcase for both the veteran star and the rookie filmmaker .
the director has written a rich role of a reluctant and ruefully wise observer of time . cue the score for der rosenkavalier . . . travel + leisure meets inside the actors studio .
the fun , misery , insecurity and idiocy of high school are depicted with vulgar , imaginative and almost heroic excess .
the people in charge , on screen and off , know what they have here , and they don 't get material like this very often in their careers .
neither suspenseful nor even comprehensible , john swetnam 's dashed-off script (carelessly directed by olatunde osunsanmi) throws up plenty of red herrings - and a stupendously idiotic ending - but not a single character worth caring about .
a compelling drama that pulls back the curtain on a problem of epidemic proportions .
overall , what we do in the shadows not only sets the standard for a great vampire comedy , but also as a great comedy for 2014 .
writer-director jody hill thinks he 's trying to push the envelope but doesn 't know in which direction , or why .
a film that runs boldly up and down the tonal bandwidth , zig-zagging from pitch-black horror to devilish satire to light domestic comedy and then back again .
kevin smith has placed a black mark on an otherwise solid filmography by selling himself short in a bid to shock new viewers and win back old ones with zack and miri make a porno .
so spectacularly bungled that it leaves the viewer in a state of advanced petrification .
. . .like watching turner classic movies while under the influence .
the brothers have returned to their roots , both visually and literally . their new film is reminiscent of their debut movie , blood simple , and its wry look at murder .
hart 's springy energy and ice cube 's deadpan snarl can be amusing , but they can 't compensate for weak material .
reworking of the 3 wise men story out west is very good ford .
now that this stupendously inept serial-killer flick has slithered into theaters , the diminutive legend had better clear room in his closet for another cinematic skeleton .
it 's poorly acted , clumsy , lazy , and as emotionally stunted as any sex comedy ever made , which is quite the accomplishment for a genre that defines itself by dick jokes and bodily humor .
this quite wonderful piece of cinema ventures into areas of family transgression that may not appeal to everyone . what distinguishes the film are the truly splendid performances from the whole cast , the intelligent screenplay and direction .
peter jackson deservedly won the best director oscar for this powerful and enchanting concluding episode to his massively ambitious adaptation of jrr tolkien 's trilogy .
the simpsons movie has a higher joke-per-minute ratio than any other movie this year , and i laughed throughout .
harsh and angry , this oscar-worthy film stages a deliberately paced , thoroughly researched indictment of institutionalized cruelty and the kind of ignorance and hypocrisy that validates and encourages it .
despicable ? perhaps not the adjective of choice but certainly a stone 's throw away from the nearby neighborhood of boring , random and witless .
starts out glib and gimmicky but later digs surprisingly deep .
a depressingly shabby excuse for a movie .
manages to move beyond its bloody rage by spinning a complex narrative that 's one of the year 's most compelling stories .
seen in isolation , the first episode has the most satisfying plot and the last the least . but the film 's achievement lies mostly in the beautifully articulated similarities and differences among the three .
the story is solid , but the screenplay is only partially effective , content to mope along with little joy or whimsy . and scenes resemble re-enactments more than meaningful human encounters .
so , while we know elisa has humanity , del toro has to plead his case for the fish-man .
it is a fascinating visual feast , the matrix with heart and soul , a rollercoaster ride into layers of the subconscious mind that challenges our ability to keep up .
one star , for principle .
as you watch the film , you feel as though the screen is tilted higher , glowering over you as you wince in its devastating presence , which is probably how martins felt scurrying through the vienna darkness .
michelle williams ' glowing performance , at times touching , tragic , innocent and sultry , rekindles monroe 's magic . her british co-stars , especially kenneth branagh and judi dench , are memorable even in monroe 's light .
only viewers wondering if james van der beek has finally outgrown "dawson 's creek" will be at all satisfied by this dreadful police procedural that contains good history lessons and bad tv-cop-show drama .
after watching strange wilderness , you may want to soak your feet in a tub of live piranhas , just for laughs . you 'll find it a lot more fun than anything in this movie .
enter the anime is orientalist at worst and reductionist at best . . . .reducing what could have been a documentary to get people involved in the culture to nothing more than a 60-minute ad-roll for netflix animation .
an elegant drama about power and its frightening uses , the cat 's meow is the bee 's knees .
the plot makes increasingly little sense as it stumbles from one apparently unrelated scene to the next .
. . .like the sci-fi flick alfred hitchcock never made .
if only this film were the least bit interesting with its highly problematic material , but red sparrow is content to be a total snooze while subjecting you to scene after scene of dehumanizing and degrading violence .
the strain to make the film both an educational tool and a child-minded entertainment is noticeable throughout .
this one , resident evil: the final chapter , ties up all the narrative loose ends , although we were never in maltese falcon territory
it 's a true rebel film , full of outrage and defiance , but it 's also an intensely personal and moving portrait of a trapped , tragic figure , just like many of panahi 's own best characters .
to their enormous credit , director gavin hood and writer guy hibbert offer no easy answers and take no easy outs , electing instead to keep viewers as conflicted and uncomfortable as the characters on the screen .
"pain and glory" stays with you , and grows richer with reflection .
the film that made consummate french actor jean gabin a star
6 underground . . . is a riotous and gleefully delirious assault on the senses . it is vulgar . it is absurd . and it is completely enthralling .
roger deakins (true grit) may have just lost the academy award for a criminal ninth time , but his talent as a cinematographer is one of the secret weapons in the first cg movie from live-action director gore verbinski .
it arrests with violent bursts and anxious pauses until its three plots merge in a satisfying resolution; its laughs caught in my throat like smoker 's cough .
even if it 's been tailor made for japanese schoolgirls , it still had me screaming like one .
this film is a poster child for the idea that more does not always equal more .
this is the type of twist that turns a mere mediocrity into a hoo-boy january stinker that clears out multiplexes faster than rotten meat in a refrigerator .
i 've never been a big fan of peter pan in any of its numerous incarnations . . . so imagine my surprise as i fell victim to the rapturous spell of this new version .
wise guys is broad and farcical , but there 's not a moment when moe and harry stop being lovable , or even believable .
spectre dances in the gate like an antsy thoroughbred from its very first frames , as if it just can 't wait to be a james bond film .
this is a descent into the seventh circle of a very particular kind of hell -- one designed by a malignant creator playfully twisting the knife .
their camaraderie and the heated arguments capture the essence of the personalities and issues . . .in a large and impressive ensemble of african-american character actors .
sumptuously produced and terrifically acted , this lively and pricelessly funny depiction of a fiery romance in regency-era england is an across-the-board triumph .
the 1998 film and its 2002 remake were able to create enough creepy images and sounds to forgive the unexplainable , but rings has characters doing the unforgivable and saying the unlistenable , so nothing skates by .
gripping , compelling , absorbing . . . yeah , all those adjectives and more , this is a great movie .
it 'll be a strange person who doesn 't find an education entertaining , and a stranger man still who denies it the success it 's sure to enjoy .
while this is an intellectual film , and a very discomfiting one , it is a film that all should experience . it 's an eye-opener , and it 's brilliantly piercing .
i have too much respect for kingsley and firth to believe they did this for anything other than the money , and to their credit , they give their best efforts .
ford early on captures the film 's more dramatic moments before giving way to its lightly romantic humor .
overall the characters are cliched , the story predictable and the jokes , for me at least , not funny .
awash in exposition-heavy dialogue , punctuated by the occasional wizard of oz reference , the film provides no meaningful background on its characters , and even less drama .
should remind most audiences of the princess bride , although this film is a lot more adult in its themes and villains .
a mishmash of misplaced scruples and corny , flash burst tv editing , it 's a wonder that peppermint was ever given a theatrical release .
'peanut butter falcon ' is sweet-natured tale of friendship , freedom
laden with false climaxes , the overstuffed plot leaves you exhausted well before the movie ends , and the amiable actors sleepwalk through their uninspired roles .
markle finds the humor in heartbreak but he also finds the heart in heartbreak .
the best film of the year .
surely the brothers grimm are deserving of a real biopic . this is not just too phantasmagorical to be entertainment , it 's incoherent , . . .an opportunity lost .
it 's as if this is a rough cut and [vin] diesel didn 't show up for the reshoots .
magical portrait of one five-year-old 's summer with his fisherman father
even a long time ago in a galaxy billions of light years away , the laws of reason would apply and these stories would be too ludicrous to be involving .
fascinating , troubling , and scathingly brilliant in both concept and execution
it 's no surprise that the movie is bad and offers nothing of value to paying customers .
was marvel 's ambitious dream for a shared cinematic universe truly worth it ? in my opinion: most definitely .
a stunning piece of work that aims and hits the audience square in the gut .
cartoonish effects and overacting make this more corn than catnip .
loads of fund

to use a pun from the movie- it is acaterrible .
who knew that the director who once gave the world hostel part ii could conjure up on the most magical family fantasies in years ?
the design of the haunted house is intriguing and disorienting with wood slat-lined halls leading to cramped tunnels and dark rooms littered with unseen dangers . if only the actual story was as inventive as the set design .
[it] feels like wes anderson 's most heartfelt film thus far . one that effortlessly straddles genres and works as both a nostalgic paean to a more innocent time and an examination of the very nature of storytelling itself .
[jeffrey wright] gives a performance of almost mystical opacity .
silver linings playbook is always interesting and full of humanity in all its shades . it has plenty of black humour and it 's superbly acted .
that she makes the audience empathize more than judge is testament to slate 's skill . obvious frontrunner for indie comedy of the year .
a brilliant piece of pure -- and purely enjoyable -- filmmaking .
one of almodóvar 's most exciting works . [full review in spanish]
anyone who is even vaguely aware of new york 's literary high society -- even from a casual thumbing of the new york times ' sunday styles section -- will realize this film is all posing and no pulse .
overall a raggedy , unfocused affair that wastes both directors ' acting talent and feels like too much work between the laughs .
just for the record , it should be apparent that if a men in black movie doesn 't feature a song to back it up , then it 's most likely going to suck .
an emotionally poignant film about a degraded and abused african-american teenage girl whose life is turned around by the love and concern of an inspiring teacher and the compassion of others .
it was with chinatown that nicholson made the world sit up and notice: he 's in every scene of this film and he fills the frame with that heady mixture of knowing charm and explosive energy .
atkins wants to expose hidden moral decay , but his slack direction fails to touch a nerve .
on the one hand dark and disturbing , and on the other , almost satirically funny .
this superbly crafted and impeccably acted civil rights drama is the first major oscar contender of the year .
boyega and newcomer spaeny give it their all; but let 's just face the fact that , just like porn , giant monster movies are all about the climax .
fate , mortality , life and death , all of this is explored in a beautifully crafted film without seeping into sentimentality .
'the place beyond the pines ' comes readymade with a heft . . .as if students have been banging out essays on [it] for years .
preposterous and blood-splattering - not even with the price of admission , let alone the added 3-d surcharge .
this wild and wacky six-pack of revenge-tinged dramas is "falling down" for the art house set .
at every turn in superman returns is a sense of respect for all that 's preceded it .

the perfect murder mystery spoof .
without a doubt the worst buddies movie and one of the more tedious holiday films i 've had to sit through .
a deadly combination of bloated , stagnant , self-indulgent and self-pitying - all of which might be forgivable , if it weren 't also so embarrassingly unfunny .
too full of studio additives and overcooked .
limey is a classic psychological mystery .
mrs . henderson presents is a classy crowd-pleaser with two stars who can pretty much count on oscar nominations .
the film creeps up on you . it yields its pleasures stealthily . it has , however , more to say about questions of public and private morality than whole libraries .
skyscraper itself defies gravity - and plain sense , and humour , and self-awareness , and most things even a dumb , hot-buttered blockbuster would have even a little of .
let 's start asking how she does it when she is a single mom with three kids , 10% of the income and no full time nanny . this is where the movie loses us .
a ripping success .
there 's no denying the biopic cliches , but phoenix and witherspoon jump even those hurdles . it 's going to be hard for audiences and the academy not to show them some love .
this forgettable comedy western is quite dreadful .
all in the movie have been encouraged to play up the cartoonish aspects of their characters , and they deliver punch lines like a series of elbows to the rib cage .
as rich in ideas as it is in fine acting , los babys is another smart movie from a smart man who will likely never make a blockbuster .
no character , no real sense of narrative , no meaningful message . it 's just terrible , shallow people doing terrible , shallow things .
a fascinating and incredibly entertaining crowd-pleaser , argo is also a testament to how much ben affleck has matured into one of the finest directors working today .
it 's a misguided enterprise all round , and while it 's perfectly possible to applaud everything the film wants to say , you find yourself cringing at the ways it 's saying it .
this droll , sweetly hilarious movie plays like the triumphant return of the silent comedy of buster keaton .
master storytellers have been revered since the dawn of formal communication .
[gilroy] ratchets the tension so imperceptibly . . . that you don 't notice how taut the action is . that is , until you notice your fingernails are embedded in the armrest .
michael caine has at long last managed to appear in a movie with the word "island" in the title that is even worse than "the island ."
the film doesn 't glamorize the misadventures of its heroine any more than it condemns them , and the result is fresh in every sense .
vampire in brooklyn is neither funny nor frightening and comes up a tedious middle-road hybrid from veteran scaremeister wes craven , who directed .
a humiliating medley of ghastly slapstick stunts . walt becker is the author of this nonsense . he ought to be sued .
if annie hall put forth the idea of art making right that which couldn 't be made right in life , whatever works is that idea put into practice .
a humor-free halloween tale , a case of pg-13 raunch butting heads with pg-rated stupidity that gives neither audience what it wants .
see it for a lesson in what freedom of the press entails , and a call to action to change the world of today . make america great again , indeed!
with its nuanced narrative and astonishing visuals , missing link -- meticulously detailed and thematically dense -- is another delightful offering from laika .
sixth sense is scary -- and smart!
a screwball comedy with charm and sass it established a template that countless films have followed down the decades .
the character names are irrelevant as the plot 's a hoary , hokey pretense to gather under the stars .
doctor strange is the coolest comic book movie of the year . truth to tell , it 's one of the coolest i 've ever seen .
the eclectic and incredible cast assembled by stone in this patriotic anti-patriot statement includes tom sizemore , vivica a . fox and james le gros . . .
a fairy tale without the disneyfication
an often astonishingly terrible and inept sequel . . .
brick lane is about characters who have depth and reality , who change and learn , who have genuine feelings . and it keeps on surprising us , right to the end .
fincher has a proven track record sifting through the dark corridors of human nature . tattoo is welcome addition to that canon , a ripping yarn that never lags during its 2 hours and 40 minutes .
if you were to only see one movie in your entire lifetime it would have to be aliens . james cameron has delivered a masterpiece that will never in a million years be topped . . .
full review in greek
just another generic studio dud .
a hoot to see matt and renee , but none of the thrills of the original . not scary or fun .
so many things go wrong -- stunningly , breathtakingly wrong -- throughout so much of dark blue that the movie is , somewhat like a spectacular auto wreck , perversely fascinating .
if all you honestly want out of it is to watch 'stuff blow up good , ' you could still do a lot better than this uneven entry in the already overstuffed disaster porn genre .
jindabyne is an eventful movie , but director ray lawrence gives the events a simple , plainspoken quality .
this movie is clearly intended to appeal to the prurient interests of dirty old men of all ages .
when the time comes to face harry 's fate , radcliffe confidently , casually shows how much he 's matured as an actor .
there is a beating heart amidst the crackling one-liners , which once again elevates waititi 's storytelling from the merely entertaining to the instant classic .
directed with quick-witted ease by will gluck , the [film is a] frank , frisky , even touching romantic comedy .
sporadically funny , casually sexist , blithely racist and about as visually sophisticated as a parking-garage surveillance video .
funny , frightening , endlessly entertaining , and with a whole host of horrible villains and genuinely likable characters , it 's one of the best horror movies of the year and a slasher all-timer in the making .
all these years later i 'm still kinda stunned that someone let prince direct his own movie .
one of those magical and rare films with a nearly perfect mixture of beautiful writing , glorious music , elegant cinematography , remarkable acting , dazzling art direction , and an engrossing story .
this movie is as much about science-faction , as it is a tense racial drama and a light-hearted comedy . it 's an education film that should be mandatory viewing for the whole family .
if only there were some kind of federal bureau that could handle the investigation of such crimes , everything might be resolved easily and quickly .
[irvine] is with that tousled blonde hair and milky skin with its apple cheeks , a beautiful ephebe with no more emotional resonance than if he were actually carved from a pillar of marble .
fine film version of the novel
after a slightly promising start , this great-looking but ultimately deeply confusing and unscary sci-fi/horror opus turns into a quite boring rehash of m . night shyamalan 's post-signs films .
it 's horrifying to consider just how this movie operates , generating so-called thrills based on a blind , empty-headed fear of foreigners . adding dumb plot twists and bad shaky-cam makes for an insultingly poor movie .
the film has very little momentum , nothing freshly imagined .
one of the movie 's pleasures is that it keeps us asking what sort of love story will once become ?
not just the best horror in ages but a remarkably astute teen drama .
a parade of creepy animated baby effects or almost equally disturbing cgi dog effects , all of which smack more of manic desperation than even passing inspiration .
full review in greek
a dull and incoherent effort with soupy flashbacks , interludes of pretentious metaphysics , and astonishingly inert action
one thing this certainly is a recipe for , is the near-perfect romantic comedy .
it 's one of the more artful pastiches of high school noir , and god knows it 's a saturated market .
boasts a startling twist ending - a trope that isn 't a stranger to the genre , but one that writer/director m . night shyamalan uses perfectly .
i 'll just say that one won 't confuse what 's offered with a film such as gladiator .
the story of harvey milk is a tragedy , but not since jeff spicoli in fast times at ridgemont high has sean penn played such a serenely happy individual .
goodfellas feels to me like the movie scorsese was put here to make . and he made it accordingly .
blandly acted , idiotically written , and incomprehensibly directed , "eye of the dolphin" is quite possibly one of the most incompetently made films i have ever seen .
the movie of the summer , the movie of many summers , going back to the '70s . . .
even generally sympathetic adults may eventually find their minds wandering , if only because of the characters ' continual , annoying hopping; being vegetables , they have no legs , you see .
one might also argue that a crack addict couldn 't be responsible enough to be a good teacher , but he 's the most believable protagonist in any american movie i 've seen this year .
the astonishing feat of the documentary lake of fire is that it takes a topic about which everyone is always telling us what to think and manages to do justice to both sides . or rather , all sides .
watching it is to watch the birth of the one of the greatest filmmakers of the second half of the 20th century
"hugo" is a miracle of storytelling and technology .
it 's on par with the big lebowski and o brother where art thou and in many ways surpasses both of them in laugh terms alone .
not just the best sci-fi flick since minority report , it 's also one of the best films of the year , making wannabe event movies like spider-man 2 look like chump change .
moves with footwork that would make the real james j . braddock proud .
this isn 't merely the best of the princess features; it 's very close to being the best disney movie of them all .
no one erred by choosing to mothball beastly for eight months . it was only in the mistaken decision to release it that the ugly came roaring out .
"shine a light" is a spectacularly entertaining film that is an absolute must-see for anyone with even the vaguest interest in rock music in general and the rolling stones in particular .
the level of badness the hobbit movies achieved is downright shocking .
a second chance for malick to cast away the chemical stained print and achieve the film he envisioned , and a second chance for audiences to experience a true classic on the big screen .
you 'd have a lot more fun sharing a few heinekens than wasting your time on this movie in which lies build upon lies until the whole plot comes crashing down .
unlike many critics , i don 't feel the sequel has the weight of the original
a meticulously crafted film in which nothing is ever forced or overstated . there 's a grace and subtlety that pervades the film and quietly impresses .
a smart takedown of iffy but commonly held values that forces a civilian family to confront the ethically complicated , though undeniably pragmatic first strike philosophy of the modern military .
this modern day morality tale may take on a very serious subject matter , but it does so in an engaging way . the humor is intact , even if the seriousness of the story has a devastating impact .
one of the most shameless vanity projects i 've ever seen .
this 3d animation about a trio of pesky houseflies hitching a ride on apollo 11 will give you a buzz only if you 've missed the last 15 years of superior animations .
never one to shy away from a paycheck , as evidenced by the steady string of roles in low-budget non-theatrical releases , willis is clearly putting in the absolute minimum effort required to continue growing his bank account .
. . .a grandly infectious animated showcase that radiates with genuine wit and warmth . imaginative , riotous and inherently clever . . .
bubba ho-tep is an instant cult classic - and why shouldn 't it be ? it 's got all the elements one looks for . . .
"ex machina" is not to be missed!
"playbook" walks a tightrope in how it portrays mental illness -- deriving humor out of its characters ' actions while demonstrating just how deep-rooted their problems are .
the social network is one of those movies that cares more about whether something "feels" real than whether it is .
our inability to identify with [townshend] means we can 't identify with the film 's central horror , and thus "contracted" isn 't all that unsettling .
a bunch of nasty kill scenes in search of a plot (and scares) .
doesn 't seem to be in possession of any form of moral compass , and all traces of humanity have been sucked dry by a need to be whimsy for whimsy 's sake .
every cliche-filled line and plot element comes from other , better movies , so why not wait for the upcoming remake of "bad news bears" ?
vincent es demoledor , cínico , frío , calmo , un hombre solitario , un asesino que reflexiona sobre el sentido de la vida .
birdman es iñárritu desahogándose de todo lo que lo frustra como cineasta .
alternately silly and shocking , yet ultimately moving , this raunchy musical revue cleverly reveals the vulnerability of ubiquitous nudity as a window to the human soul .
marci x plays like a satire made by people who don 't know the worlds they 're satirizing .
a mind-numbing , soul-deadeningly dull experience , it is a miracle of mediocrity , a small wonder: how can anything be quite this tedious ?
staggeringly dreadful romance .
a 3d film aimed mostly at children .
makes a strong case , ultimately arguing for the futility of the war on drugs , particularly a drug like marijuana
the scariest thing about predator is that its lead actor , arnold schwarzenegger , is currently serving as governor of california .
it feeds the warrior fantasies of adolescent boys with a testosterone-heavy tale of a war free of moral complications .
12 years a slave is essential viewing .
joins "the disaster artist" as tangental films far more captivating and enjoyable than the messes they explore .
a sense of youthful joy and lightness , missing from many recent burton works , engulfs "frankenweenie ," despite its dark subject matter .
kids , you can tell how much your parents love you by how far away they keep you from this worthless fiasco .
a crass , crude , and overly-familiar comedy .
amazing film .
the sharp angles and rough edges of nicole kidman 's performance appear all the more vividly .
all i kept writing down in my notes during the movie was "gruesome" "i can 't breathe" "my stomach is in knots ."
terribly maudlin and ultimately exploitative .
how many false alarms can you have before the audience finally gets impatient and bored ? two ? three ? ten ?! ?! ?!
it 's as effective in 2009 as it was upon its initial release , and the richness of its tapestry , densely woven from human emotions and character interaction , ensure it will never lose that relevance .
junk science meets even junkier filmmaking in expelled -- a no more shameless , stupid and loathsome piece of propaganda has ever skulked its way into the theater .
click to read review
a richly textured and human drama brimming with warmth , tenderness and pure , unadulterated poignancy .
mesmerizes on many levels .
it 's the type of film that , whatever time of day you watch it , makes it feel like half past two in the morning .
the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence .
some will laud it , others will loathe it , but make no mistake: blair witch is that game-changer horror fans desperately have been waiting for .
the dialogue tends toward the obvious , and the characters are constantly explaining what is happening to one another .
this is a strong story from a skilled filmmaker; with these actors telling it , it 's almost essential .
far too derivative of other angsty independent romances that it failed to keep my attention
one of the funniest sports movies ever .
you just have to marvel at how well jonze and screenwriter charles kaufman keep the whole thing from strangling on its own eccentricity .
it has taken allen over 30 years , but he has finally made a movie that 's almost unwatchable .
catwoman is not destined to have nine lives .
this film is a feminist wannabe and a twin peaks imposter which is disguised in technicolour neon vibrancy .
the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .
kill bill is a temple of worship -- a devout hymn of praise to crap cinema (which isn 't always crappy) .
anyway , we went to ultraviolet so you won 't have to . it was awful . next time you go , okay ?
in terms of mood and style , it could be the most influential film to come along since blue velvet .
another sequel that never should have been committed to celluloid .
for the first time , hollywood has made a whimsical , witty , feature-length version of dr . seuss that 's neither overblown nor smutty nor emotionally hollow .
while there 's a melancholy in seeing supremely talented individuals whiff so badly on a creative project , it 's never been so funny as in gemini man .
this dismal little potboiler delivers only tedium
somewhere amid the unbearable stereotypes that choke this sophomoric comedy is a potent blue-collar revenge fantasy about an arrogant white-collar crook getting his just comeuppance .
"a most wanted man" is the rare film that will remain on your mind long after you 've left the theater .
both a documentary and , for all intents and purposes , the last testament of a generation 's tragic folly .
this is a winner , an atmospheric thriller with terrific performances and outstanding production values .
an extremely cold , creepy and brilliant examination of the spookiest edges of the male psyche .
michael mann reminds us why muhammad ali was the greatest -- inside and outside the ring -- in 2001 's best film .
a ghastly romantic comedy about a race to find a 17th-century spanish wreck full of treasure . the film is completely dead behind the eyes .
good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there 's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat .
while watching this unforgettable film , i pondered the nature of humanity , so capable of good and evil , and the righteous bond between mother and child .
mesmerizing , poignant and thoroughly captivating . if you 're not moved by it , you must be made out of stone . it 's one of the best documentaries of the year .
even without the complexity of its message , zootopia would be a worthwhile addition to the disney canon; the characters are great , the world is fascinating and the narrative is top-notch .
the dialogue is atrocious .
andrea arnold has demonstrated her mastery and fluency in the social-realist idiom , and simply makes it fizz with life .
. . .even if ledger hadn 't died , critics and audiences alike would still be buzzing about the star 's turn as the joker .
i 'm not sure zombie really wants to scare us at all . turn our stomachs; maybe , scratch our heads , sure . but scares are not really on the zombie menu .
grim , nihilistic sequel in none-too-cheery series .
never mind high concept , this is high conception .
one of the worst thrillers of all time . an ugly mess that clearly no one saw before releasing . [full review in spanish] .
ready or not combines humor and murder to create a deliciously wonderful film and brought a surprise hit with critical acclaim to movie theaters this summer .
there are most things more terrifying than slugs
a nerve-bludgeoning , relentlessly exciting action movie masterpiece .
this is the worst yet from michael bay 's horror production company platinum dunes , which also brought you rubbish re-makes of halloween and friday the 13th .
depp is wonderful here , and sparrrow is the best creation of the movie year .
rumor has it is glossy , pretty and utterly forgettable , just like -- except for that last part , evidently -- aniston 's fabulous hair .
a brash , brutal crime-caper film , reservoir dogs has enough raw energy for 10 motion pictures and more than enough rough stuff to traumatize the sensitive . but not only does dogs have teeth , it has brains .
riveting , fast-paced!
a hare-brained excuse for a satire .
the best british film of the year . you 'll be floored .
with "the silver linings playbook ," russell picks up the traditional quirky rom-com genre and shakes it around , just to see what happens . where it 's going is fairly predictable; how it gets there isn 't .
misplaced critical vitriol torpedoed the original 1960 release of director michael powell 's psycho-horror . fifty years later , it 's an undisputed british masterpiece .
"midnight special" is masterful in the way it keeps answering questions and then asking new ones , always staying one step ahead of the viewer .
goes from (alleged) comedy to serious drama with all the subtlety of a ten year-old playing mario kart .
. . .what incentive did anyone have in even making this hopeless mess ?
john wick is the platonic ideal of a disposable action movie . it gives you everything you want , nothing you don 't , and gets you in and out of the theater .
only the prospect of the outtakes and chan 's flubbed chopsocky stunts kept me going to the end , and even they turned out to be duds .
as rumbling and tremendous a meditation on self and suicide as there 's ever been onscreen . director terence davies has now made masterpieces across four decades .
the sum of the effort is a sincere film that offers insight in surprising areas .
tiene la magia de las viejas películas clásicas de disney con todo y su mensaje de luchar por los sueños y así lograr lo imposible . una verdadera delicia .
a b-side to the act of killing but no mere blue in the face afterthought .
the present edition , in spite of an impressive cast , is a blood bath that is more violent than any before , but to no avail .
this movie is so good i moved to kansas!
act of valor essentially marries platitude with attitude , veering from the realms of wholesome all-american family life to bullets-raging battle scenes .
the performances don 't sync up , and the jokes don 't land .
amazingly amateurish , the film lands wide of satirical targets that should be impossible to miss .
as much as this tale of bent love runs in the ruts of its maker 's obsessions , it has an undertow that 's impossible to shake .
badly written , shockingly acted and appallingly directed threequel that will please precisely no-one .
missing the point of what true grindhouse fans are looking for , don 't expect much life to be found in this stale , monotonous , mind-numbing tale , making biehn 's audience the sole victim in this whole debacle
the truth is , rob reiner has come up with another clinker romantic comedy .
bridges , as always , is a joy to experience , digging into his role with unbridled gusto .
simone is brilliantly creative and hilarious , a wild and silly farce that holds nothing back in its gutsy attempt to abandon every ounce of sanity . . .
. . .a captivating , mesmerising , and remarkably painful journey into adolescence and independence .
with snowpiercer , joon-ho demonstrates just how to make a boldly inventive modern sci-fi film without giving a damn as to what hollywood thinks a blockbuster film should be .
o filme tecnicamente irrepreensvel , mas o ritmo lento da narrativa e a auto-indulgncia do diretor lou ye simplesmente destroem a pacincia do espectador .
'getaway ' has accomplished one significant thing . it makes plain that selena gomez has no business passing herself off as an actress .
a 115-minute cinematic scream of rage . the picture is as weirdly cathartic as it is entertaining .
if nothing else , the directors have assembled an impressive , if underutilized cast .
a fascinating , if dated look at the aids crisis of the 1980 's with a central moral that still applies today .
a brilliant thriller  terrifying and relentless .
there 's something a little special about this film in that it might well be the most wholly anarchic they ever made .
here is a romcom that has been developed on a petri dish in some unspeakable secret department at the porton down biological warfare unit , designed to release a gaseous vapour into cinemas , rendering the civilian population immobile .
it feels like something new and different . futuristic , even .
wheatley playfully bends genres in this romantic-comedy road movie so we never know what might happen next .
when the only elements that could be called professional are the photography and the poster art , you can consider this a movie only the producer 's mother could love .
a menagerie of menacing and morphing computer-generated special effects make the movie worthwhile .
the soul-sucking nature of capitalism drives this brilliant film , but the rich characters and the almost constant tension keep it emotionally resonant .
it has the pace of an oscillating house fan , going back and forth between boring exposition and bursts of action in which you suddenly have no idea wtf is going on .
an entirely needless followup to the ring and the ring two . . .
everyone deserves a movie , even bros , and when it comes to the type of old school-style young male who feels threatened by women who are funny and gays getting married , this is the movie for them .
history as drivel , rebellion as sunday-morning hangover
masterfully crafted by guy ritchie , this refreshing take on sir arthur conan doyle 's sleuth is a great vehicle for downey to create another distinctively eccentric character .
how could so many talented actors contribute their skills to such drek ?
prepare to be slimed .
welles almost creates a mise en abyme throughout citizen kane , inviting but ultimately refuting the tendency to want to reduce everything to one core sentimental genesis .

full review in greek
a drama that injects your adrenal glands with the thrill of living from score to score and walking the streets with limitless power .
this "reimagining" , by the director marcus nispel , of the 1980 slasher movie is one hell of a bore .
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film: boring .
blades of glory is only slightly less funny -- if you ask ignorant old me -- than watching real figure skating . it 's your coin .
storytelling , performance and visual literacy this brilliant may be out of style , but i can 't imagine anyone who sees kiss kiss , bang bang not coming out panting for more .
the favourite thrills , delights , and even touches the heart in its giddy chase of power and what its pursuit can do to us .
every generation gets the dopey , drippy , star-crossed teenage romance that it deserves , and so here comes stella meghie 's self-conscious , phone-obsessed everything , everything .
dracula may stay undead in the new millennium , but there 's not a sign of life -- oh , that bloodless acting -- in this sorry mess .
even on a hot night , audiences might find themselves shivering at this movie .
good movie about the consequences of our choices .
not a video game , but an incredible simulation of one trying to pass itself off as a movie .
a retread of every lousy '80s high school comedy you never bothered watching .
one of the best movies of woody 's mid-80 's "second wind ."
the filmmaking is so brisk , elegant , witty and surprising; it 's a captivating experience .
[a] searing , scalpel-sharp documentary . . .
there is really no way to describe the playfulness and exquisite timing of the comedy in this film . it is partially herzog 's zany artistry , and partly cage 's masterful control of facial expressions and comic timing .
the new soap opera from america 's least exciting regional filmmaker .
it 's a mesmerizing vision of the past refracted through the dark obsessions of the present .
the film is some sort of humor-deprivation experiment .
it 's schrader 's on-point filmmaking--a nouveau spin on the spiritual films , character studies , and transcendental style of cinematic old masters like bergman and bresson--that functions as what toller calls 'another form of prayer . '
a nightmare of a movie .
in the first film , depp had fun chewing on the scenery . in this one , the scenery swallows him up and eats him raw .
it 's one of the year 's unique and most entertaining movies .
five minutes into the film , and i wanted to flee .
poignant ? only because someone worked pretty hard on this .
i heart this film! do you like quirky comedies ? existential philosophy ? or at least , do you like (or need) to spend a little time reflecting on meaning in your life ?
compelling , adult , sexy and fiercely stylized .
if there are a few sweet moments between rauch and middleditch here , they 're all but erased by an ineffectual story . . . and an admittedly impressive void of genuine laughs .
highly recommended , primarily because of the infectious camaraderie of co-stars paul rudd and jason segel , as well as for the casually-captivating screen chemistry of rashida jones .
a film of such immense and quirky beauty that it is destined to be a cult favorite .
this is one killer kick-*** of a movie!
the sharp angles and rough edges of nicole kidman 's performance appear all the more vividly .
i wanted to like it , but this new glasgow-set drama really is weak .
probably the best stage to screen adaptation i 've ever seen . essential .
one thing the great wall gets absolutely right is the walliness , because watching it feels like repeatedly banging your head against one .
action movies don 't have to be believable or poignant . they just have to get your adrenaline pumping . but the movie lacks inspiration in that department , too . . .
'the fault in our stars ' is today 's younger generation 's 'love story , ' a famous romance from the 1970s .
unfortunately , this michael bay produced version suffers from horror cliché-itis of the '00s .
feral and uncomfortable .
it 's so inconsistent and broadly drawn that wrongheaded is the operative term .
despite a breezy premise , this rom-com displays lazy filmmaking at almost every level of the production
gone girl is an entertaining film in a category that is woefully missing in most movie theaters nowadays - storytelling .
there is not a single misstep in this poignant , true , and ingenious character drama , an extraordinary film that is one of 2016 's best .
the best movies seem to reinvent themselves as they move along , not drawing from worn-out sources , and map of the human heart is one of the year 's best films .
hunt for the wilderpeople magically taps into the logic , thought processes , and emotions of a child . it 's a rich , strange , and wondrous world .
peter farrelly has fun with stereotypes but he also explodes them , especially the old canard of "polite" racism that is anything but .
raja gosnell 's direction follows the first rule of slapstick: if actor stuck with nothing to do , have them fall in vat of goo .
be still our little saber-loving hearts! it 's here . . .
this is marvel studio 's best film to date bar none .
instead of looking for more , you should be looking for less .
ballast is a serious achievement and a welcome sign of a newly invigorated american independent cinema .
possibly the lamest of all the sequels , although five and six later set the bar particularly low .
horror/thriller/pile of excrement .
a hugely enjoyable family film . a typhoon of primary colours , larger than life characters and some razor sharp self-knowing humour - ttgttm is the film to see this summer .
as a facile little valentine 's movie , it 's just fine , but as an adaptation of a modern piece of classic literature , it 's an absolutely dismal failure , a blight on its source material .
it 's an amazing thing watching perkins do his schitck with the role .
after thinking it 'd take "a couple months" to ink , director christopher nolan took eight years to painstakingly write the "inception" script . and you can tell . it 's his first pure masterpiece .
bland , disappointing - quickly forgettable and regrettable
da vinci tis sure to stir up a big ol ' nest of locus-n-controversy . but it 's a helluva film!
absolutely brilliant
the safdie brothers ' nervy ball of tension sends a hustler (adam sandler) blasting recklessly through a city where everybody is on the make .
an engaging twist on the thriller genre .
"moonlight" is a minor miracle , a movie that mines beauty out of the ugliest situations , and a glimmer of hope from heartbreak .
not only does 'the incredibles ' advance the art of animation , it takes the genre out of the ballpark .
visually stunning , kung fu panda 3 is also a very fun and entertaining movie . [full review in spanish]
singleton sometimes displays his youthful inexperience in melodramatic emphasis and rhetorical flourishes , but he has created a deeply troubling film about responsibility .
in its way , this effort is both a forceful assertion of the most stifling brand of auteurism and a radical reconfiguration of its political potential .
an extraordinary journey through the complexity of latinamerican culture . [full review in spanish]
stylish , unsettling and deeply provocative , this is brilliant filmmaking on every level , destined to become an american classic .
the style , like the theme , is poised gracefully between order and chaos .
destined to become a sci-fi classic , "star trek" boldly goes where none of the previous entries have gone before .
has a huge heart . there won 't be a dry eye in the crowd .
room begins as a mystery . slowly , it reveals itself to be a story of survival , first physical , then emotional and psychological .
great cast + great script equals great movie! liz and dick at their best .
the only thing that works in this film is zach gilford , otherwise it feels like a bad mashup of two screenplays , with a terrible life lesson .
however , it is springsteen the raconteur - in a more rueful and reflective mode than his usual brand of stage banter - that is the principal focus of the tony award-winning show .
as great a movie as the brothers have ever made .
designed to trigger a strong emotional response , and nobody can rightfully deny that it does so .
the film ventures somewhere new , cloudy , revolutionary and without a doubt , fascinating . [full review in spanish]
moving and tense .
a brilliantly realized , acidic satire of american political life . it takes us into a strange , hallucinatory world that is hard to shake , long after the movie is over .
for a similar and more rewarding experience , i would recommend contracting food poisoning , dropping acid , and crashing the nearest frat party .
"joker" effectively tells a story with themes borrowed , but not stolen , from movies like "taxi driver" and "network" and makes them its own platform through its own disturbed form of avenging angel .
one of the most sophisticated and intelligent follow-ups to a horror classic that has ever been put to film .
while herzog 's philosophizing may not be as valid or necessary here as it perhaps has been in a number of prior works such as grizzly man , cave of forgotten dreams is unmatched in its enchantment .
ever heard of the phrase , "if it ain 't broke , don 't reboot it ?"
with its amazing widescreen compositions and epic running time , this western truly wins points for length and width .
'an amazing and magical film! '
one of the great horror-thrillers of the 21st century .
as art , shifty is unoriginal and tedious . i find it difficult to imagine who would pay to see this for entertainment .
jarmusch , who made supernatural vampires seem human in only lovers left alive , now finds inspiration in the mundane .
. . .techno-fetishism at it 's worst .
"a fantastic woman" becomes a delicate , moving study of grief , of quiet triumph over adversity , of adjusting to life 's empty spaces - and learning to fill them with love .
a marvel of performance and effect utilizing the man against his environment/survival motif to justify visual and technical elegance and brilliance .
as good as toy story looks , toy story 2 looks even better .
the wheel 's fall off this thing pretty early on
its triumph lies in its scope of cinematic splendour and the attempt to marry some of man 's most beautiful music to the infinite mystery of space .
for at least the first hour , stealth is a saebcpsos (shockingly and excruciatingly boring columbia pictures sack of s---) .
humanity is intricate , contradictory , fathomless here , and the filmmaking just as rich .
not often does a movie character make such a harrowing personal journey that keeps us in deep sympathy all of the way .
an enchanting , gritty and funny short becomes a feature film with its charms intact .
of more interest in this movie is its fabulous style , which takes precedence over niggling details like plausible storylines or characters .
not just colin farrell 's best performance , but a film that reminds us what a contrivance marriage and relationships can be when mandated by societal pressures .
a film replete with awful acting that glorifies nihilism . . .in your face movie-making by people with a moral compass badly askew . there 's nothing remotely entertaining about this film .
it has a cast of otherwise good actors doing bits of business (sometimes called acting) as if they thought they could upstage all of the movie 's automobiles , which are seldom still .
expect sweaty palms as the pressure mounts , since your apprehension skyrockets when watching monsters who 'd murder at the drop of a hat .
one of the most imaginative and creative films ever made .
an exciting , thrilling , soaring adventure with the rare combination of dazzling visual effects and a heartfelt story that 's captivating for everyone both young and old .
an engrossing , densely plotted thriller .
an unlikely marriage of directorial and writerly sensibilities has produced one of the most stimulating films of the year .
this is not a very good movie . in fact , it is a bad movie -- a very expensive , very highly produced and very predictable cinematic skid mark .
while it might make a charming book-on-tape for the oprah crowd , this 'love loves to love love ' hokum masquerades as a real movie .
this frequently brilliant epic does more than make us understand the challenges faced by trans people and those who love them - it makes us feel those challenges ourselves .
too dull to be fun , too inept to be engaging , and too low-rent fx-wise to be dazzling
. . .one of the most effective and flat-out engrossing thrillers within recent cinematic history . . .
it 's all about the snappy dialogue and simmering tension between these hugely charismatic stars .
it may be the worst romantic comedy i have ever seen , and this is not hyperbole .
where 's a wooden stake when you need one ?
lucy is more of the same mostly nonsensical gibberish we 've come to expect from late period besson (taken 2!) .
as directed by alexander payne , the film moves seamlessly from wry humor to heartbreaking sadness and takes clever deviations from the expected .
ragged and raw , yet it 's also intimate and mesmerizing .
an inspiring and mesmerizing 90-minute re-creation of the historic mission , constructed out of footage shot during the monumental event . you must see this movie .
. . .seems to suggest that a touch of sin is all humanity needs to descend into a downward spiral .
a rather rudimentary look at vengeance and survival
i can 't remember another time in my film-watching career where i sincerely hated a movie . . . one of the worst films ever made
jessica chastain has what may be the very best part of her career with molly 's game . given her impressive filmography so far , that 's saying a lot . she 's on fire in this role .
at his best , [kevin] smith captures the zeitgeist of an era and becomes the voice of a generation .
garner 's a great earp (see "hour of the gun") but this witless movie trashes not one but two great western legends .
during its rocky road to becoming a fractured love story , silver linings playbook and its great ensemble cast run a funny , conflict-mined , even suspenseful path . it 's a total winner .
storybook perfection .
raw , brutal , compelling , and heart-achingly sad .
with the brothers solomon , will arnett continues to squander the goodwill he engendered as gob on arrested development .
sarah polley is much more interested in the malleability of memory and the consequential refractions felt throughout her kin rather than telling a linear narrative .
though it occasionally misses a beat or overreaches itself with snappy little asides , bombshell is a finely crafted film which benefits from one of the best acting ensembles of the year .
one sits there wondering if all the fizzled and obvious gross-out and slapstick gags are supposed to be funny .
birdman is a rich , startlingly clever and multi-layered collage , with iñárritu creating a meta-universe of mirrors and performances upon performances .
yet another entry in the jason friedberg-aaron seltzer series of movie spoofs , this scattershot collection lame gags is the definition of disposable entertainment .
if lucas is raiders ' guts and kasdan its head , then spielberg is its beating heart . little wonder part iv is still on the cards .
expect to well up while watching emotional tableaus of grieving mothers burying their babies at funerals and simply staring blankly into the camera with tears streaming down their pained faces .
the central metaphor gets richer the longer you think about it .
exciting , vital cinema that pushes the boundaries of what movies can do . it 's a masterpiece .
revived are memories of lost pets , the realization of the reality of life and death , and the ability of kids to hang on to hope no matter how overwhelming the odds .
as stylish as it is suspenseful .
uma thurman as a would-be actress is the one bit of genuine radiance in this aggressively and pointlessly shiny , noisy spectacle .
everyone involved in this film might want to reflect that nazi medical experimentation during the second world war did in fact happen , under circumstances other than these .
rock of ages winks at us , but the joke 's on the film , which feels more dated and lame in its stale broadway conventions than any warrant song ever will .
in scene after scene , spirited away unleashes so much wonder and visual imagination that you end up watching the movie in a state of rapturous , awestruck bliss .
grief has a demonic presence in hereditary . . .
there are a few moments of genuine emotion , mostly created by robertson and whitehall , but they are lone flowers in a desert of sitcom contrivance .
it 's a film that is absolutely hard to watch . it 's also a film that absolutely should be seen .
simply unmissable .
. . .a fabulous , daring , intelligent and wild experience , electric down to the finest details and polished by its own shrewd sense of comic intensity .
borrowing from this bottomless well , perhaps it 's best to say that you should hang up , turn off your phone or even cancel your service should this film attempt to reach out and touch you .
. . . youthful , fast-paced , thrilling , funny and fueled by an adventurous spirit .
writer-director rian johnson , following up his witty 2005 debut , the high school noir brick , has a real gift for putting his own modern stamp on time-tested genres .
the debut film from performance art crossover miranda july delivers an unlikely blend of irreverence and optimism . for all its dark humor and fringe qualities , the movie never descends into easy misanthropy .
a horror film of a visceral beauty . [full review in spanish]
meu desejo era o de que o mineiro realmente aproveitasse a tecnologia tridimensional e , acabando com meu sofrimento , rasgasse a tela com sua picareta , libertando-me da tortura de acompanhar suas aventuras .
this is a depressing motion picture , yet the issues it addresses are real , especially in a world where the term "childhood innocence" is losing all meaning .
avoids the typical bombast of the normal crime thriller , instead focusing its efforts at being a densely-scripted character study .
a lively , engaging and sweet-natured movie musical .
a true delight - a fun , clever , and , of course , whimsical tale about the days when love seemed worth running away from home over and getting a scout badge meant the world .
it absolutely doesn 't work .
like its main character , never die alone is beyond redemption .
this wannabe epic is forgettable , bland and way too long .
brewer hasn 't sugarcoated his pimp , and howard 's performance locates all the shadings of fury and desperation that drive him .
with a riveting performance , cate blanchett creates one of woody allen 's most memorable movie characters in years .
with its narrative slight and familiar , and its sense of drama and threat muted , it relies upon its roster of recognisable properties - and the affection everyone has for them , especially off-screen - to provide interest .
off-putting drama of growing up male in the 1970s .
n our age of real life self-mocking , opinionated hogwash , the surrealist/satirist iannucci has , with the death of stalin , once again nailed it .
john carpenter 's the fog is a beautifully-made , atmospheric chiller with top-notch performances by an amazing cast .
forget the boring other madagascar movies with the lion and his friends . this one is hilarious . and it 's a blast in ordinary two-dimensions or in glorious 3d .
writer and director chang-dong lee 's film is moving without ever stooping to melodrama; yun is the main reason why .
the folks at disney prove that clothes -- and little else -- make a man , and do so with extraordinary style .
a male and a female teenager are . . . switching bodies freaky friday-style . far from a gimmick , this plot point is used to explore issues of gender and culture in a unique way .
[redford] gives a commanding performance as the nameless protagonist that makes the complete lack of characterisation an irrelevance .
anchored by foxx 's astonishingly powerful performance , this moving and engaging biographical film . . . is also director hackford 's finest film .
schultze may have the blues , but the film of his wanderings is a joyful experience .
a wonderful homage to our most precious commodity and superb cinematography
ronan 's big talent , the sweetness and resilience of the characters , and the film 's big heart , are almost irresistible .
a spectacular misfire , even in the less-than-glorious history of horror remakes .
young lewis macdougall is very good as conor as is felicity jones as his mother , while sigourney weaver invests the difficult part of the grandmother with a tightly wound intensity .
the studio is touting the film as a "contemporary western" but a "two-hour hip-hop video with stank soap opera plot" is more like it .
feels like a lost eighties john carpenter movie- and i mean that in the best way . don johnson is stunningly good .
a pointless drama that trafficks in clich .

never a mess had seemed so relevant to the star wars universe . the last jedi pays no respect to rules and manages to be a single and pretty good entry . [full review in spanish] .

a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .
bullock 's talent for gentle farce is not enough to carry her here; there are only so many times she can get a laugh out of stumbling in her high heels and talking with her mouth full .

another of the three or four obnoxious , race-baiting flops hollywood routinely seems to tolerate from martin lawrence between can 't-miss blockbusters such as "big momma 's house" and "bad boys ."
i 'm probably not the first to say it 's a train wreck . starts out good enough , shows ability to the 1/2way mark , but the last 30 mins are just a scripting mess .
any movie that has the word "wrong" in the title should be very , very careful to get things right . the makers of this movie were not careful .

merely lurid slice-and-dice junk put through a cuisinart .
the old west re-imagined as fodder for the coarsest of gross-out fare!
this production clearly ploughed all its budget into a few slick action sequences and the cameo from willis . it 's a pity the film-makers didn 't invest in the screenplay .

at times , monster trucks faintly echoes e .t . , but it has all the grace of a jacked-up ford f-150 with a four-link suspension and tractor tires crushing a row of cars by steamrolling atop them .
death wish -- the 2018 version -- is riddled with more plot holes than bullet holes .
wouldn 't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here 's a movie about it anyway .

there i sit , suffering total numbness of body and brain , no longer having to wonder what it might be like to be buried alive in gooey marshmallow .
[director] bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack . he tries to get under our skin with a pile driver .
the filmmakers have mastered the blood but not the tedium of all of the predictable killings . nor have they eliminated the '"hate-women" subtext to the entire series of films .

even as asia is dropped on europe the film lacks the comic book enthusiasm and clear-eyed momentum of the 1996 original .
a work of stunning inertia and obtuseness , francis ford coppola 's return to the director 's chair is a disaster of career-destroying proportions . . .
although it 's being advertised as a horror movie , the return actually invents a new genre: the bore-or movie .
frenetic direction and supercharged cuteness pitch in to aid in the distraction , and it 's almost enough to produce a kind of numbness .
what else would you expect from the director that gave us this february 's pinnacle of cinema tripe , welcome home roscoe jenkins ?
weakly scripted as a jekyll & hyde-type origin story , it 's clumsily directed and dreadfully disappointing . yet , as the box-office shows , never underestimate the appeal of comic-book movies .
isn 't it washington that took money from the taxpayers to bail out the banks ? shouldn 't moore run his yellow crime-scene tape around the white house ?
silly sequel elicits more eyerolling than laughs .
rod serling would have wrapped this mysterioso story about a psychiatrist and a suicidal patient dislocated by time , space and a lot of crazily raked angles into a tight half-hour episode .
where do you even start with cats ? tom hooper 's big screen version of the andrew lloyd webber musical is unlike anything you 've ever seen before , but not in a good way .
with tonal shifts so abrupt that they could give you motion sickness , it goes from cheesy soap opera to bad slapstick to gooey romance to mean-spirited farce .
desperate and dreary , the pink panther 2 is an empty-souled star vehicle that hasn 't a clue what actual wit and comic timing entail .
there is no way for a love story to work when we don 't believe the lovers belong together .
this lame biblical/caveman jokefest fails to elict many laughs .
. . . the signal achievement of this version of 'anna karenina ' is that it manages to use a world literary classic as the platform for nothing less than the longest chanel ad ever .
the grudge 2020 's worst offense is that it utterly fails to find its own voice , its own take on the material
when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
a desperate violence and urgency spills out in the film 's flash-point set-pieces - not least a sensational car chase , shot through a windscreen , hammering rain and a blur of fear .
a well-intentioned but ultimately disastrous attempt to throw a pulpy new spin on one of english literature 's most revered figures .
an operatically stupid , tonally deranged comedy-drama . . .
i can accept that many find this entertaining , however , i 'm just not one of them .
the good news: if you 're a fan of the unkillable video game adaptation , then don 't worry; it looks like there 's going to be yet another installment in the resident evil series .
the 'exoskeleton ' subplot is as clunky a metaphorical experience as you will ever endure .
gone is the shaky-cam dynamic . gone is the whole "devil inside" ideal , and gone is any reason to care or watch .
this would-be romantic comedy is neither . the premise is misbegotten , the chemistry non-existent and the dialogue leaden .
it 's the kind of film where every character is given one usable skill that will pay off at the film 's conclusion , and outside of that , no one gets anything else to work with .
yu-gi-oh! the movie , a hyperventilating feature-length advertisement for japanese trading cards , would be hilarious if it weren 't so dreadfully cynical .
boils down to another average adaptation of one of the increasingly weak stephen king novels that hit hollywood like a bad rash in 1983 .
beautiful to look at , with painterly compositions , gorgeous , emotionally charged close-ups and slick , elegant transitions . it 's all for naught because the story seems no more coherent than the flourishes of a kaleidoscope .
a choppy , cheap-looking mess with awkward dialogue and huge gaps in the plot .
a musical that is hideously naff , shallow , creepingly misogynist , badly acted and as phoney as a three-lire bill .
batman ninja makes joel schumacher 's batman & robin look like mask of the phantasm by comparison . no joke .
"the transporter refueled" should be put up on blocks .
most of the movie feels nothing like an exorcist film .
a surreal thriller needs a thrillmaker with a gift for the surreal , not the pedestrian talent (here) of joe wright .
i now pronounce you chuck & larry is not as hilarious as it thinks it is , profound as it pretends to be , or tolerant as it intends .
renner , also a producer of the movie , makes the fatal mistake of rendering a complicated figure a simple warrior for facts .
the distasteful formula is even more sour and ham-handed than usual; broderick 's and devito 's natural likeability never stands a chance .
despite finding the prospect of legions of zombie crows appealing , the sad fact is that they 're not very well done , and they 're housed in a movie that 's even worse .
its utter pointless sadism makes the movie unwatchable .
amounts to overkill and leaves no room for interpretation or analysis .
i was bored numb by this movie .
the dearth of laughs in this unspeakably awful comedy borders on embarrassing at times .
is dr . seuss rolling in his grave yet ?
irritating , faux-edgy , tonally wack , strained , unfunny , and such a colossally tone-deaf misfire
equal parts poorly acted , poorly directed , and poorly written , the film 's bloodless pg-13 rating hinders its potential even further . this is a really bad movie .
not uninteresting , and it is very nicely performed , although you 'll strain to learn from the movie the history on which it is based and struggle futilely to get inside the motivations of its characters .
one of those uninspired films that gave sequels such a bad name .
perry 's film adaptation clearly preaches to the converted while presupposing its tv-sitcom humor will win (or convert) new fans .
never achieves the stinging parodic heights of cohen 's borat movie , but manages a better batting average than his most recent misfire , bruno .
at least vince vaughn , jon favreau and their fellow cast and crewmates were able to spend time on a gorgeous tropical island while making this mirthless , half-hearted relationship comedy .
full review in greek
d .e .b .s . is so unflinchingly cute that it forgets to be either funny or flat-out satiric .
a bland , timid and thoroughly un-thrilling teen thriller .
the underworld series hits a palpable low with this absolutely interminable entry . . .
thanks , mr . mallick , for 2 1/2 hours of pretentious wanking!
what were the filmmakers thinking ? i mean , what besides making a second trip to the barn to milk the $300 million cash cow that was miss congeniality ?
my god! what happened to sydney pollack ?
tacking on a bunch of pretentious voice-over nonsense about angels and self-realization doesn 't get snyder off the hook for a movie that doesn 't realize how wrongheaded , humorless and offensive it really is .
poor tim allen looks positively embarrassed throughout the picture , even when he 's trying to rescue it .
it 's like a nightmare in which you are trapped in an endless kmart aisle of horrible holiday cards .
suicide squad is . . . disorganized , colorful trash slathered in embossed fonts and spray paint . . . missed opportunities , whiffed almost-jokes , and half-baked ideas .
completely forgettable
telemarketers as targets from which satire flows eternal were spigotted about the same time as mall cops , and that 's not all this jammed-scattergun approach to comedy has in common with the terminally dopey paul blart .
in his fourth and feeblest movie appearance in just under a decade , the man of steel in blue underwear becomes a peacenik .
about 80 minutes too long .
it 's all pose , with hardly a laugh in sight
it 's a zero , wandering around itself , benignly hoping that it will make us laugh even though it has not offered funny material or delivery .
for a movie with music at its core , if i stay sure is tone deaf .
i have never not laughed so much .
a reprehensible film that is completely devoid of laughs .
the camerawork and acting are both "handheld": wobbly , ill-focused , exploratory , uncertain where to go next .
adam sandler and pals take a vacation from laughter in this dreadful coming-of-middle-age comedy .
a mindless action movie passing as a serious war epic that is dragged out , unsure , and quite random .
a film so mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality .
it 's the end of the world as we know it , and i feel bored .
the real dilemma in the sadly unfunny "the dilemma" is that several different movies are going on in director ron howard 's first nondrama in 11 years .
i sacrificed 90 minutes of my life points to sit through this and nothing i can summon is going to make up for that .
transformers: the last knight was doomed from the beginning when a transformer gave a drunk merlin magic powers and a dragon to help king arthur and his knights of the round table defeat . . . an army
like a sharp stick in the eye
fathers and daughters is a sentimental pile of tosh
this "dinner" is spoiled before the appetizer even arrives .
for all its glad-handing of cheer and all-encompassing warmth , has a heart as tiny and cold and calculated as a grinch 's .
this curious western may set a new world record for out-of-the-blue inanity , which comes winging in toward the end of the picture .
why would a psychic 'tec need to sniff a toothbrush to locate its user ? does spearmint freshness have a spooky vibe ?
part end-of-life romance , part grossly manipulative mush , the film tries to stare grief and mortality in the face while practically shitting rainbows .
if say it isn 't so isn 't enough to kill the gross-out comedy trend , nothing is .
serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .
the film is essentially an exercise in forcing a female genius back into her proper place of dependence on both the father figure and the prince charming .
anyone who has ever followed the project greenlight television show probably will agree that . . . the movies all suck . . . feast does not turn this around .
it deliberately sells a perniciously sexualised view of children and glorifies violence , especially knife and gun crime , in a way that makes it one of the most deeply cynical , shamelessly irresponsible films ever .
with greater care taken over the haphazard pacing and poor script , the equalizer might have been a fun night out . instead it begs the question of when washington will be given a movie worth his talents .
makes edward and bella look like harry and sally .
most bad comedies plod from scene to scene . this one plods from sentence to sentence . grant and parker stand around as if they 're waiting for someone to yell , "cut ."
as bloated as its star 's pectoral muscles and as lastingly resonant as any random episode of smackdown .
sure , these 'zesty ' , 'lively ' old folks are enjoying themselves . the question is why on earth we should be expected to watch .
has a grownup person written this script ? it is embarrassingly unconvincing .
a tacky , cgi-driven action-horror flick with some of the most vacuous writing and wooden acting to ever torment damned theatregoers .
padraig reynolds 's film has no interest in self-awareness , and in fact wears stupidity as a sort of badge of honor .
the willis-morgan team is about as on point as four legs with the ankles missing . the sequel will undoubtedly star adam sandler and chris tucker .
saw v ? you 'll wish you hadn 't .
dolittle is an unmitigated disaster .
nothing in sinister 2 comes across as believably scary .
this soggy contemporary fairy tale is a cinematic cream puff with a melted marshmallow inside it .
if you 're given the choice between seeing national lampoon 's gold diggers and death , you 'd be wise to choose death .
a megatomic nuke to the senses . . . that attempts spectacle but delivers shaky-cam confusion and exhausted cliches for optimum headaches and head-shakes .
alexander and the terrible , horrible , no good , very bad -- movie .
one of the worst films to pass itself off as family entertainment features a flirtatious woman , a rich kid no one questions , and a brutal series of gags .
other than the promising storybook-like animated prologue narrated by emma thompson , who voiced polynesia the parrot , the rest of the movie quickly nosedives and barely recovers .
gruesome , nasty little horror creature/feature from writer/director victor salva , a convicted pedophile .
it 's wretchedly unfunny and tonally erratic , the striking production design notwithstanding .
the only jaws to watch out for in this film are yours , hitting the floor .
how do i loathe thee ? let me count the ways . this is an epic failure on every level .
the very definition of an easy target--and , in all fairness , it deserves every last bit of criticism .
this drama styles itself as a cinematic epic , but its substance is as flimsy as a jack chick pamphlet .
the mind marvels at the bravery of the person who walked into the producer 's office to pitch this idea .
a lazy script makes for a cheesy and predictable film that features two crummy performances from stars who are hard to dislike .
twenty years after he directed the monumental con air , simon west does duty on one of those embarrassing underpowered british attempts at an american-style thriller .
how anyone in the cast manages to keep a straight face is one of the film 's innumerable mysteries .
aside from being another rote addition to the revenge-film canon , john stockwell 's in the blood is also a supreme waste of gina carano 's talent .
begins as a not incompetent home-invasion thriller and ends with a nifty punch line about female empowerment . the problem is everything in between .
tv movie fare at best .
jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
buday 's script is directionless and his direction listless .
it 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
this isn 't just a chick flick wallowing in moon-spoon-june levels of hallmark mush; it 's the 'macarena ' of cut-rate rom-coms .
exactly when it happened , i can 't put my finger on .
a new story out of carroll 's mythmaking that fails to inspire interest , perhaps except as a rote exercise in mainstream weirdness .
if the film were any more portentous , it would be laughable . in the event - partly redeemed by bardem - it is merely stupefying .
this comedy isn 't just juvenile , it 's borderline brainless - the sort of bland , unfunny and , at times , slightly offensive drivel that one might expect from a grade schooler .
a heat-free pseudo-lesbian spoof of charlie 's angels by way of heathers .
van helsing is the worst would-be summer blockbuster since battlefield earth .
square in the middle of the series , quality-wise: though the new film has some unabashedly dumb moments , its plot lacks the pathetic contortions that we saw in saw iv
as coy sleaze goes , the new olsen twins ' movie doesn 't match britney spears 's crossroads , but it comes close .
the film effectively amounts to a cringe inducing live adaptation of a hallmarks card
there 's little action in this snail-paced bore , you 'll need a high-powered magnifying glass to spot the comedy and the 'buddies ' have about as much chemistry as a pair of wet socks .
loud , grisly , action-packed and profoundly un-scary .
the film feels about as genuine and spontaneous as its evident lip-synching .
bargain basement horror .
the film might have been silly enough to be enjoyably camp . instead it 's a witless omnium gatherum of mongrel sources and clichés .
a loud , seemingly interminable , and altogether incoherent entry in the preposterous and proliferating "action-comedy" genre .
for an alleged psychological thriller , the night clerk has no thrills , suspense or tension .
not even the rock soundtrack can infuse this story with any momentum or meaning .
if obsessed were a perfume , it would ming like happy hour at a squids ' brothel . this atrocious , and atrociously derivative affair is not only an early contender for worst film of 2009 .
constantly bouncing from derivative to ridiculous and back to derivative again , gothika will be tolerable for undiscriminating horror fans but should be shunned by everybody else .
utterly intolerable with its indulgence in inner-city stereotypes , overt preaching and simple antidotes .
amazingly bad . to call prom night a horror movie is to call chewing gum a cheeseburger .
a tense , paranoid nightmare with a chilly metaphysical overview has been trampled into a blustering , bad cartoon .
robinson apparently believes the best way to jolt an audience is to have several sequences where darkness and silence linger on the screen before having loud music wake viewers up from a well-deserved slumber .
there 's no reason to see the raven . it 's an unoriginal plot that you 've seen a hundred times before . the performances are lackluster and the direction is uninspired .
if a worse film than i , frankenstein crawls from the murk in 2014 , then it should be stuffed and mounted .
like the carol the film proudly blares during christmas season: "joy to the world! the savior reigns!"
extremely low-rent actioner that 's only for die hard jcvd fans . even van damme seems bored , opting to keep his sunglasses on for almost the whole movie .
rain without thunder is the longest 85-minute movie i have ever seen .
don 't say you weren 't warned .
an underwhelming sci-fi flick with vin diesel as the muscle-bound anti-hero who speaks with violent actions .
for the dull and preposterous 95 minutes of 16 blocks , audiences are sentenced to willis playing a boozy burn-out and a nasal-voiced def doing his imitation of porky pig .
a low in soulless hollywood christmas movies , and more celebration of consumerism than condemnation .
pretentious , incompetent , dumb explosion movie .
plays less like the gritty action-comedy picture it aspires to be and more like a disingenuous 126 minutes of slick hollywood inanities , a cobbled-together series of flashy explosions and none-too-witty banter .
poor blake lively does her de-glammed best in this poor xerox of much better turn the urchin into a spy thrillers . but there isn 't a single human interaction in this hamfisted movie that rings true .
this movie is just inane .
the lazy regard for david 's moral crisis , or lack thereof , is pitiful .
a formulaic hodge-podge that trades on a certain demographic 's affection for the bogeymen of their formative years .
bland script , bland acting , just vanilla all around .
tingling jaws notwithstanding , the scariest thing going on here is the realization that this loser got picked up at sundance .
too stupid for grown-ups , too gross for the tots , / the movie was really upsetting me -- lots .
"mine" is a classic example of a high-concept film that painstakingly sets up its unusual premise , only to squander it .
a twist-burdened techno-thriller that would be by-the-numbers if it could count .
anybody tempted by nostalgia should stay away to preserve the illusion that this was once so well-liked .
it 's ostensibly a remake of the 1950 walter lang comedy , though latter-day audiences will detect a far greater kinship to an early episode of the brady bunch with twice the brats .
a hopelessly conventional horror b-movie built on hurricanes , cardboard characters , and computer-generated alligators . [full review in spanish]
in the theater where i saw it , the tedium was broken only by the sound of angry birds being played on iphones .
it simply relies on the hope that mary-kate and ashley olsen have such a devoted fan base that they will immediately rush out and support their film , no matter how bad it may be .
should once and for all spell the end of larry the cable guy 's horrendous run of hollywood hokum .
the movie 's not very good , but there are ideas , good and bad , in its execution that are worth mulling over .
too closely cropped to allow for the expansive feel of an oceanic epic , and fails to develop any meaningful relationships among its characters .
if you overlook the f-bombs and the drug deals , hustle & flow is peddling the same easy-path-to-riches-and-romance story danielle steel keeps cranking out .
it 's not a bad film - lee directs with subtle grace and the cast is predictably strong - but it 's saddled with too many characters , not enough drama and a strong sense of overfamiliarity .
that convention-flouting title misleads: this winsome affair lags lamentably close to the modern romcom average .
regardless of its true-story credentials , summer in february seems to have been cobbled together from the moldy spare parts of countless masterpiece theater pbs movies .
an endurance test of a movie . . .
only a human vegetable could have possibly viewed the final cut and not have had any vocal concerns about the submerged level of quality on display .
tidy , bland , rabbit hole is the kind of movie that really doesn 't want to offend in its tale of child death and making friends with sandra oh
the skulls is less interested in politics than in profitably flattering the suspicions and resentments of its intended teenage audience .
how , this far into the 21st century , does a film like this get made ? one that shunts bruce lee to the status of secondary character in a lazy and boringly familiar star-crossed romance ?
[the film] lacks soul and credibility . [full review in spanish]
not perfect . not really about a holiday . at least 'the ' is accurate!
margot robbie was fun as harley quinn in suicide squad . here she is as not fun as she was fun it that . it 's a supporting character at best & the schtick wears out quickly .
this flick is so giglicious . . . i laughed so much i almost forgave pitof for being in heat and spraying this cinematic violation all over dc 's trademark vixen
you could say that pg-13-rated horror movies are , well , "cursed ."
for cage completists only .
lacking forward motion , space chimps turns itself in circles .
never coming close to achieving the level of laughably bad , the dry and ludicrous stigmata never rises above painfully bad .
this dreary time-and-talent waster seems to have been aimed at undemanding three-year-olds whose parents have more money and less sense than is good for them .
an insufferable , poor-taste thriller devoid of substance and almost completely free of scares , not to mention original ideas .
the plot twist is telegraphed far in advance , and everything in between is an unpleasant waiting game of watching a rape survivor warm up to her rapist . . .please forward return to sender to the trash .
you could think of the producers as a way to see most of the broadway cast for 1/12 the price of a broadway ticket . or you could think of it as a bad idea at any price .
stereotype-based comedy from eddie murphy in a variety of fat suits is just not enough to make a decent film .
if any horror film characters deserve to die gruesome deaths , it 's these idiots .
not a complete lost cause , but no one tries to emerge from the icky goo known as mediocrity
the singing detective is one of those films that is high in concept , but poor on delivery .
bones might have been fun if it pumped up the camp a bit , but the movie takes itself too seriously to succeed on that front .
the film is a pile-on of a sequel , adding next to little to complement the original .
since heijningen already had dibs on the thing 's hallowed name , he didn 't even bother trying to conjure any of its slow-burning suspense or claustrophobic vibe .
so utterly awful that it should have been renamed 'my time to waste . '
the worst movie of the summer .
even the soft porn is a total yawn .
all in all , there 's only one thing to root for: expulsion for everyone .
mediocre and highly forgettable action-thriller .
the movie paints crude and insulting portraits of israelis and palestinians , going in for the basest stereotypes that would only bring a smile to the face of a klansman .
when you consider that garant and lennon make their living as screenwriters for hire , hell baby 's shoddy script is an unholy mystery .
the scare-free when a stranger calls is the worst of the seminal horror movies from the late '70s and early '80s that have been getting the remake treatment lately .
why do filmmakers continue to feel the need to squeeze all the joy and magic out of such a remarkably enduring figure of edwardian-era make-believe as j .m . barrie 's peter pan ?
by attempting to say everything about race , haggis ultimately says nothing .
this film might be aimed at the under-six crowd , but that is no excuse for scenes that will bore older viewers into a coma .
takes the sloppy sentiment and cheap , once-a-week aesthetic of television and inflates it into an ugly , self-consciously respectable film . there 's not a genuine moment in it .
missing from the third installment are many of original scribe kevin williamson 's self-referential genre jokes and a lot of his energetic bravura .
[a] witless , charmless , groin-gazing bromance about three smackable young men and their various interpersonal gropings .
a compendium of every odd-couple pairing ever made -- tricked out with a sufficiently high flatulence quotient to satisfy the requirements of the most demanding 5 year old .
when vincent gallo 's crazy-sleazy-cool act is the sole element of realism , there 's a problem .
in retrospect , i should have gone with the olsen twins .
why is tina fey trying to be will ferrell ?
the film plays for much of its length like a terrible sketch comedy with one-dimensional caricatures shuffling listlessly through a succession of stilted tableaux .
the story is hilariously pointless , seemingly moving forward with random events just to fill up a feature-length time slot .
ludicrously bad!
a 40-minute television show stretched out into two hours .
after seeing 2012 i had to take a shower i felt so unclean . if 2012 succeeds , we 'll have the deluge of crap . it won 't be the rapture; it will be the evacuation .
in the end , what we have here is a tarzan movie made by people who don 't understand the appeal of tarzan .
the credits list the film as being "written and directed" by paul w .s . anderson . "programmed by" would be a more accurate credit .
at the centre of our galaxy is a supermassive black hole . not even light can escape from its powerful gravitational pull . and not even that sucks as much as this movie .
by the time it winds to a conclusion , the film seems to have tired itself out , like a toddler who screeches nonsensically for hours , then falls asleep in a fetal ball in the corner .
video-addicted kids may well find this exciting , but for anyone old enough to stay out later than 9 p .m . it 's a distinct bore .
something soulless and empty , with all the mystery and grandeur of the tale just gone .
such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
once the flashbacks set in , the yawns start .
the audience is one who needs saving , not the title character , in this latest entry in the look-how-dumb-i-can-get comedy sweepstakes .
unless you 're a 14-year-old girl who gets all giddy at the thought of cute boys and first love , steer clear of thirteen director catherine hardwicke 's anemic adaptation .
a dumbed-down ripoff strictly for the tyke demographic too young to notice that the flick 's a thinly-veiled retread .
with any luck its sequels will fail to garner a stateside release due to that most dependable of domestic attitudes: american apathy toward soccer .
a shouty , hammy , tedious , damp-squib firework display of dullness .
if it 's a good heist movie you 're after , there are surely better ways to go than with this limp caper .
experiencing this pretentious wallow -- overwritten , under-thought and overdone -- is a very sophisticated form of torture .
an anticlimactic , idiotic leap into low-end shyamalan-ian insanity with a touch of moderate fundamentalism . nicolas cage 's performance is deserving of another youtube ode to awfulness , and only disaster scenes elevate it above straight-to-dvd status .
the worst thing to happen to fictional seattle since frasier bedded roz .
even accounting for the difficulty , "bitter harvest" is a weak effort , with nothing to redeem it save for a certain base level of competence .
directed by christian (pandorum) alvart with a crazy bevy of random overhead shots , it wins 2010 's first genuine place in the so-bad-it 's-good honours list .
one idea , mixed with lame jokes , and stretched beyond coherence . vampire academy doesn 't need a review . it needs a stake in the heart .
bourne leaves no legacy for singelton 's asinine thriller .
after two hours of this drivel , i was praying for the end credits .
a work so screeching awful and irritating that it almost makes "alvin & the chipmunks: the squeakquel" seem palatable by comparison .
the film is so bad it doesn 't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
labute 's remake is an interesting idea that never transforms into a particularly satisfying movie .
jill soloway 's film is dishonest in the way it attempts to mask self-pity as enlightened self-criticism .
a gloppy , scattered sop to the power of positive thinking from director brad bird (the incredibles , which offered a much sharper take on the subject of being special) .
a superficial , clichéd jumble that illustrates what might happen if you threw moulin rouge and amélie into the same high-speed blender .
screenwriter melissa rosenberg continues her long tradition of scripting staggeringly banal , subtext-free dialogue and grasping at the profundity of her betters by quoting poetry in the prologues .
an inept black farce about two 19th century bodysnatchers that couldn 't be more lifeless if it was one of their victims .
once upon a time , anything associated with the name "national lampoon" generated as many chuckles as a can of nitrous oxide . now the effect is more like a laxative .
the movie slumbers along as it ends up nowhere . considering everyone involved , this is a disaster of epic proportions . what just happened ? . . . indeed
dull at best , painfully unfunny at worst , let 's hope the answer to are we done yet ? is in the affirmative .
portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
it 's consciously derivative film-making , aimed at people who paid to see every sequel to friday the 13th and didn 't mind that they were basically the same movie .
there 's a good movie hidden beneath the prosaic rubbish we 've been served up . unfortunately , no matter how far we dig , we 'll never be able to reach it .
at razoavelmente divertido em sua poca , tornou-se (ainda) pior com o passar do tempo , sobrevivendo apenas como mais um dos inmeros momentos embaraosos da cinematografia norte-americana dos anos 80 .
centurion is a curious mixture of gladiator , braveheart and apocalypto , but not nearly as good as any of them .
adam sandler takes on terrorism as israeli agent-turned-hair stylist in raunchy shock comedy .
the romance is forced and phony - after only two weeks together , the two are behaving like an old married couple .
an offence to the amish
it 's not even value for money if you 're a moron .
full review at movies for the masses
kadeem hardison is the best thing about this film , playing maximillian 's slowly rotting ghoul henchman . however; one has to wonder about a film where eddie murphy needs comic relief .
the plot is too foreordained in every detail to be genuinely gripping , and the action far too shoddy in both conception and execution , which is even worse .
(y)ou 'd have to be brain dead to defend such illogical plotting , one dimensional characterization and aimless middle act meandering supposedly passing itself off as humor .
isn 't so much confusing as it is bafflingly uninspired and stupid
a horrible script makes for a horrible movie . even if the rest if it is done brilliantly .
it stinks so bad that buntzen lake , where this bogus effort was partly filmed , probably still reeks .
the anxiety is deafening in this flimsy symphony of shattered lives , which -- like that confounding oscar winner crash -- confuses entropy for empathy .
there 's plenty of singing and haircutting and pretty landscape and annoying crap to fill in the blanks between confrontations .
rivals "get hard" as the worst thing will ferrell has ever said "yes" to .
like imogene 's early promise , "girl most likely" is likely to be forgotten quickly . the sooner the better .
one of the most poorly conceived , inept , and ridiculous motion pictures ever greenlighted in hollywood .
was everyone so gung-ho on making a stylish sci-fi flick that it never occurred to anyone how nonsensical and even amoral the whole thing was ?
it 's a slasher film that only understands the simplest formula of the subgenre - stalk and kill - yet can 't even execute such a minimalist horror architecture with staying power .
if meyers-shyer is determined to follow in mum 's footsteps , she has long way to go .
not to venture forth some sort of radical idea , but aren 't comedies supposed to have jokes ?
extraordinary measures strives to tug at our heartstrings , and educate us on a little publicized disease , but it ends up feeling like a drug itself - manufactured using artificial chemicals by technicians in a cold lab .
kingdom of heaven has at its center a bold story , and yet it sits there like a stone pillar .
just a boring , bad action movie - which , to be fair , means that it 's one of the best video game adaptations ever made .
the title of half past dead isn 't meant to describe the state of one-note , whisper-tough action star steven seagal 's movie career -- but it wouldn 't be far off .
with the film feeling so remarkably slapdash , it is a big step down vigalondo 's previous work , and a hugely disappointing english language debut .
its star ice cube remains characteristically amiable , but this thuddingly miscalculated comedy is way beneath him .
this is one of the most inept and clumsy pieces of filmmaking in recent history .
raunchy romcom promotes double standards , stereotypes .
a catastrophe of bad acting , ludicrous science and conspicuously cheap special effects that can 't even follow its own internal logic from one scene to the next .
a cheap rip-off with a story and ending that made no f-ing sense!
underclassman was probably a gas to film . watching it , on the other hand , is like sitting in afterschool detention .
travers hated what disney did to her creation , and she would have hated what his studio has now done to her .
. . . an exploitative , silly and thoroughly unpleasant affair , with a premise that defies credibility .
a laughably slapdash concoction of steely liam neeson speeches , stolen cues from the drive soundtrack , poorly cut fight scenes , and a healthy heaping of xenophobia .
a pretentious picture so bad that some will probably embrace it as some kind of artistic triumph .
a hopeless mess of never ending exposition and random , completely unrelated side trips into useless minutia .
the film isn 't very interesting because it isn 't well made .
gertrude bell deserves better , and so do we .
i have four words to account for the popularity of park chanwook 's stylishly inane crime picture: asian chicks in prison .
this is a horrible film .
a truly wretched sex comedy , or should we say non-sex comedy .
an endurance test of a movie . . .
nothing but mild vulgarity mixed with explosions and entitlement , a piss-take on hollywood excess that doubles as an example of it .
being frank festers uncomfortably from start to finish .
weighted with moments of surprising power yet undone by crazed-crank nickelodeon pacing .
audiences with a brain cell left have only one choice: look for the first exit on the right .
flaming white hot death to anyone involved in this crappy film!
i can 't adequately express how soul-sucking the crime subplot is here .
shows a new level of filmmaking incompetence previously only seen in the films of dr . uwe boll . it is just plain awful
tiresome wannabe thriller , incoherently spinning its wheels for 97 minutes with sheer stupidity .
the man and his music are worth checking out , even if the movie is not .

all setup and no payoff makes this a dull film .
low-wattage sequel
escape plan knew what it was , escape plan 2 is the exact opposite and it makes you appreciate the first movie even more .
step away from the vehicle .
watching tank girl is as disorienting as waking up in someone else 's bad dream . you want to get out as fast as possible , but all the exits seem to be blocked .
alas , the only surprise was in seeing how little a top-notch director can do with a woman who simply cannot act .
scripted with a subtlety befitting tinkertoys , directed in a manner that would shame the small-screen union hacks who rap out xena: warrior princess , and acted with the sleepy glumness of a therapy session .
i may like this genre of comedy , but a film like this makes me hope it 's going to fade soon .
this mess of a film isn 't remotely entertaining . it only perpetuates generic social myths in the place of presenting fresh , insightful social satire . in short , it 's more hellish than a blind date .

full review in greek
the main crime in this movie is that the whole thing feels lazy -- it 's as if they filmed the first draft of a script that still needed some trimming and sharpening .
to put it bluntly , loose cannons is garbage .
this film is less of a sequel and more of a carbon copy .
congratulations hollywood; you 've completely disemboweled a truly funny man .
really not very funny . unless you 're a moronic frat boy who 's been smoking a lot of wacky backy , in which case it 's probably hilarious .
tinker bell and peter pan go through their pixie dust-powered motions throughout the film , but nothing ever soars .
heartless is as witless as its protagonist , whose willingness to make a pact with satan is so knuckleheaded that his subsequent torment feels deserved .
i 'm still marvelling that i 've actually seen this
lugubrious and lackadaisical
martin is passionate about finding his adopted brother , but that passion never translates to the screen , as the actors have little chemistry and the time-jumping structure robs the story of its emotional punch .
the story is boring , the action scenes are fine as far as they go , but the whole thing 's a waste of time . don 't waste your time .
david siegel and scott mcgehee 's film renders the rhapsodic henry james novel of the same name into an abhorrent slice of tasteless familial drama .
i found myself missing jeff spicoli .
martin lawrence bites off a bit more than he can chew with his four roles in this haphazard comedy . as a result , nothing seems quite focused .
no mystery why hopkins climbed on board , the only mystery is why anyone else did .
chazz palminteri , jaime pressly , cary elwes , christopher lloyd and cloris leachman appear in brief roles , all looking slightly confused and vaguely embarrassed .
the really offensive thing about it is how lazy it is .
schreiber 's film version of everything is illuminated achieves the impossible -- it 's even more annoying than jonathan safran foer 's gratingly precocious novel .
a few hectic chase scenes aside , children will likely find the film both boring and upsetting , a deadly combination .
absolutely terrible unfunny netflix romantic comedy
imagine a rambo remake directed by fahrenheit 9/11 's michael moore while high on crystal meth .
if you know someone who is thinking of putting their kid though one of these programs , buy them a ticket . if not , what 's the point ?
rough night is unbelievably poor . some of its relentless sloppiness would be forgiven if it were ever funny , but it never is .
a miserable load of deranged , deluded crap masquerading as a black comedy . . .
the plot , as incomprehensible as it is uninvolving , has stallone 's utterly unmemorable crack prison-break team banged up in yet another off-the-grid illegal jail called hades .
instead of being booked into theaters , 'when in rome ' would be a better fit for one of the eternal city 's apocryphal vomitoriums .
dated and very dull .
they look like jobbing veteran actors picking up another payday in some routine cop filler , and avnet 's busily clueless direction offers them and the clunky writing little help . pacino . de niro . it 's over .
green 's efforts to strike a balance between knowing humour and no-holds-barred horror are stymied by an erratic tone: a slow , talky build-up gives way to a soggy middle section and a messy , all-stops-out finale .
the following plea is for chloe grace moretz: "please find a new agent!"
there aren 't enough creative yiddish insults in the world to adequately express how much i hate adam sandler 's "eight crazy nights ."
labeling a film grind house doesn 't excuse soap-opera emoting and laughable dialogue .
[p]redictable , full of bad dialogue and stuck with a cockamamie concept that 's too harebrained to work - even within the relatively lax confines of the horror genre .

incomprehensible story , cheesy dialogue , poor execution , cheap production value - saw 3d hits for the cycle of bad filmmaking .

it twists , turns , and avoids unpleasant aspects of the disney company , both immediate and historical .
totally trashy , several steps beyond creepy .
very interesting idea . very uninteresting results .
perhaps if you have a special interest in foul folks and morbidities , you will thrill to this hal wallis picture . frankly , we squirmed -- and not from dread .
imagine it 's a comedy and pray for the end .
a heaping radioactive pile of garbage , with cookie-cutter characters enduring loud scenes of destruction and then uttering banal profundities in the silence that follows .
gangster clichs fly like submachine gun bullets in the italian crime biopic "angel of evil ," a restless and hollow rundown of '70s criminal renato vallanzasca .
if you 're hungry for comical interpretations of an errant war , may i suggest any episode of m*a*s*h -- or , indeed , any episode of fox news .

strangerland runs out of gas , leaving us with a couple of final "forget you" (shall we say) moments . thanks . thanks for nothing .

with the curse of la llorona , the conjuring universe has damned itself to an eternal cycle of rinse and repeat .
women never have a great time in westerns , but brimstone takes it to extremes; inflicting endless humiliation , misery and trauma upon its female characters .
a flat , draggy exercise in cheesy special effects and grandiose art direction palming itself off as a horror film .
the hilariously awful tale of a selfish jerk who learns absolutely nothing . . . full of helpful tips on dating strategies such as underhanded manipulation and blatant stalking .
full of car chases , weak jokes and scenes so meandering they make saturday night live look like a paragon of brevity and wit .

wicker park isn 't very good , but it is fixable . the biggest problems are caused when director paul mcguigan is trying to do too much .
so bland it 's easy to forget the title only minutes after exiting , this emmerich-by-numbers invasion movie exists only to offer you the cutting edge in unconvincing special effects .
for a movie about the importance of emotion , the giver is surprisingly inert , and also clumsy about hitting its beats .
like every non-nutritious piffle hastily-consumed , the guilty reflection will come in the long hours after .

the film is rife with unexpected revelations and twists but the filmmakers ' sly maneuvering , instead of sucking the audience deeper into this psychological thriller , are apt to make them feel manipulated .
the problem is not one of factual accuracy; it is one of dramatic credibility , stymied all the way through by the remorseless sanctification of its subject .

the politest way to assess spike lee 's latest polemic is to call it too ambitious . 'an unholy mess ' might come closer to the truth .
a very long mess that 's embarrassingly devoid of gut level thrills .
it 's a movie that 's too bland for adults , too cutesy and juvenile for teens and pre-teens , and too confusing for kids . in other words , it 's a movie for no one . . .
incoherent , tedious and largely devoid of wit .
a barrage of bad jokes , offensive stereotypes and dated reference points , the movie is like meet the fockers on overdrive .
it 's become almost trite to criticize him for his recent string of dubious movies , but we 'll do it anyway , because he 's capable of so much better .
a parlor game could be made out of how many times the word "fear" is uttered in martin campbell 's superhero franchise non-starter .
. . . the level of boredom i experienced during geostorm ought to qualify as at least a second-degree felony in the state of new york .
this 90-minute movie feels about five hours long .
theron is fetching enough in her tight outfits , but utters each line like she just downed a handful of quaaludes .
disappointing , cynically contrived and desperately unfunny ensemble romcom that falls painfully flat thanks to dull characters , an irritating script and some deeply misguided mawkish sentimentality that 's unintentionally the funniest thing in the film .
mythical tale is violent and poorly executed .
a miasma of mixed messages and exhausted clichs shot like a retirement home commercial and scored with an anvil .
the young and the restless with gas fumes .
it starts loud and just pounds along , and rather than the pulse-pounding adrenaline rush intended , a stultifying action fatigue quickly sets in .
bellow out one last sorrowful death rattle/grudge-gurgle , this is the franchise flat lining without so much as a whimper .
about the only redeeming aspect of the entire film is dawson 's performance .
awful from start to finish .
slapdashly assembled and lacking in dance thrills .
a movie is not a public-service announcement , and a movie that tries to squeak by on intentions doesn 't generally doesn 't get very far . viewed from any normal perspective , radio flyer never takes off .
amazingly , it is even worse than it looks .
that sound you hear is from jet engines gassing up , about to zoom underclassman to dvd-ville .
supernatural is not much better than subhuman: hollywood is still , in the year 2000 , disinclined to let black actors play human beings .
they definitely don 't come any worse than this .
"sisters" impossibly comes off like it was conceived , written , and shot in less time than it plays .
character development is non-existent , and isolated scenes resonate with occasional whimsy , but they don 't add up to a satisfying whole . the adjective that best describes phil is preposterous .
writer-director brian helgeland gives us violence without felt menace , doomed romance without felt desperation , and decadence without felt pleasure .
this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea (or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
this unfunny , sexist movie may generate a few laughs if you 're easily amused , but it demonstrates that hollywood has forgotten how to make romantic comedies .
yes , there 's pointed human comedy to be mined from the very real stresses of married life , but this bonehead idiots-in- paradise farce raises issues only to gloss them over .
sean penn gives the most professionally shameful , cruelly wrongheaded performance ever nominated for a best actor oscar , while jessie nelson kristine johnson 's script lives down to penn 's ugly ineptitude with idiotic catchphrases and product placement .
marks an anti-milestone in journalism (about which stone has plenty of complaints , specifically identifying fox news and the new york times) .
what brit writer alan moore made work on the printed page , is as dumb as the plot synopsis makes it sounds .
. . .ugly , unedifying exploitation cinema .
another entry in violent , played-out sci-fi series .
. . . the picture ranks among the year 's most confounding and flawed .
an ambitious misfire . . .
how to talk to girls at parties is overshadowed by its need to be eccentric and so it 's hard to take it very seriously even when it 's trying to take itself seriously .
the biggest sin of the final destination is its general lack of imagination .
the film is a sloppy , discombobulated mess that mistakes loud skate punk music for character development and prosaic special effects for a narrative .
an extravagant , pathetic pageant .
perhaps even worse than the first two
well-intentioned , at best , regrettably , this fairly formulaic , philly sports flick doesn 't show enough brotherly love for anyone to be proud of it .
dumber and more desperate than any episode of catfish .
the amityville murders wastes historical reverence on a paint-by-numbers ghost story that relies too heavily on eyesore animated effects .
a muddled mess of melodrama .
this movie is crushingly ordinary in every way , which with rand i wouldn 't have thought possible .
you 'll be glad when it ends . . . .!
complete with clichs and plot twists that scream , "give me an oscar ," you might think tina fey and jon stewart decided to write the reader as a parody of an oscar hopeful .
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us "the skulls" and last year 's "rollerball ." enough said , except: film overboard!
low expectations met .
the story is dismayingly ordinary and its execution by director david gelb is virtually devoid of invention .
key revelation is that shore is a bitter , unpleasant , petty , humourless little man--and that his stoned weasel song and dance isn 't doing that great a job of hiding it .
there might be true satire here , but it would take a far less bored reviewer than me to pick away at the flab surrounding the satire .
seeking a friend for the end of the world is as insufferable as its title .
horrible . terrible . unfunny .
throughout , some obvious questions pop up immediately .
. . .going for the hip hop-loving teen market (both city and suburbs) that is more than willing to drop big money on flashy hubcaps , flavor-of-the-month cds and crappy movies .
babbit 's poky pacing . . . doesn 't do either star any favors , and anyone tempted to watch for prurient reasons should know the film is more basic-cable-at-10 p .m . sexy than after-midnight-on-showtime sexy .

given the inevitable response to this equally regrettable rom-com , she can expect to loathe independence day , too .
a monumental act of stupidity and vapidness .
the plot . . . rips off the original - which was thin to begin with - and makes it worse .

one remake the world is probably better off without
ultimately , the entire film plays like a 100-minute deleted scene - shaggy , formless , and voraciously inconsequential .
this is a terrible movie in its own right , tasteless and condescending -- if sandler 's character is an everyman , than the everyman of today is a boorish jackass .
never die alone makes each viewer die alone , but shared laughter with other customers may forge a death-pact bond .
brad renfro in his last movie role , playing a wannabe film actor who sprays out filthy perspiration like a collie emerging from a sewer . it 's possible this role killed renfro .

# a compendium of bad ideas and worse filmmaking , jake (son of ridley) scott 's welcome to the rileys is forever peddling its psychologically reductive message until , at the end , it fairly screams it out .

there 's not an admirable person in the bunch .
a coda after the closing credits , encouraging divine dialogues in general , does little to dispel the hagiographic aftertaste .
loud , obnoxious and one of the year 's worst .

resembling the all-time dullest episode of mtv 's 'undressed , ' the canyons unfolds like lifetime tried to make a cinemax movie .
a slick technical packaging by director antoine fuqua can 't offset the lumbering plotting and patchwork quality of producer-star gerard butler 's vehicle .

while the underlying concept of the series is the examination of a big social experiment , this gets lost in the film . extremely lackluster fare , overall .
writer-director jason todd ipson 's romantic comedy is so awash in tired ethnic clichs that the story drowns .
this horror fanatic doesn 't have room for craven in his genre anymore . collect your cash and call it a day already , wes . . .
the film is shoddy and amateurish; the blood in the gunfight scenes even looks like ketchup .
one of the worst popular comedies of all time .
rv is vacation for people who loved flubber .
falls down due to a badly written script , boring zombie-blasting sequences , tedious characters , a complete absence of humour and the lack of anything even remotely resembling a plot .
the finished product is shockingly bad . . . an exercise in futility . spare yourself the agony .
when people moan about the world 's worst film-makers , the names uwe boll and joel schumacher invariably come up . if brian levant has escaped such infamy , it 's only by sticking under the radar with kiddie-litter .
josh peck is terribly miscast in this role and his character is so annoying , he almost made me root for north korea .
based on its reputation alone , 1981 's roar is the citizen kane of films where actors were mauled by lions .
flashbacks of the original carrie are the only worthwhile portions of this otherwise abysmal movie .
it has the grace of a tumble off a ladder .
universal is hoping this will be the dawn of a new age for their classic monster franchises . . .but after seeing "dracula untold" , my guess is frankenstein and the mummy won 't be returning calls anytime soon .
this film is bad - really , really bad .
. . .has the advantage of being only eighty-three minutes long and the disadvantage of seeming like an eternity .
hardcore fans of the comics may enjoy venom more than an average moviegoer , but the film is ultimately too weird and confusing with an ending that 's just stupid .
a romantic comedy that is more or less a poor facsimile of the plot of as good as it gets .
the fly [on the wall] is very good at getting access . . .but rather less good at giving context .
set against all the thunderous themes are the antics of a bunch of uninspired imaginary animals - sorry , fantastic beasts - and an astonishingly winning cast that very nearly atones for everything else .
it 's not a costume drama in any real sense , with blusters of wind standing in for dialogue and , frankly , sheer boredom subbing for brontë 's look into the riddles of the human heart .
the talented comedian mugs his way through an utterly deflated film .
don 't believe the hype . . .this movie is an awful mess .
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
it 's a cynical exercise in marketing , masquerading as a maverick .
mile 22 takes the extremely talented iko uwais and puts him in a clichéd story with terrible editing that hides his skills as a fighter .
so . . . bland .
even for a farce , the situations stretch credulity far beyond the breaking point .
if only i could go back in time to convince myself not to watch this ludicrous time travel yarn which 'faxes ' a group of uninteresting characters back to the 1300s to screw up the space-time continuum .
and what would the film be without its performances ? better .
. . .hopefully this is the final episode of a bad voyage . [full review in spanish]
the film 's creators use sexual humor as a stand-in when they run out of vacuous little sub-sketches .
made with so little spark , humor , and internal logic .
they 've left it late , but writer-director richard kelly (donnie darko) and his team have gone and scooped the independent 's worst film of 2007 award - against stiff competition , too .
one character almost has it right when she describes it all as jerry springer . but even the ringmaster has standards: reverse racist drag is so three seasons ago .
seriously , do vanity projects like this really need to be made ? don 't we all have better things to do ?
if the adam shankman film 's debasement of its subject into campy kitsch is the unavoidable fate of all culturally dangerous art , that doesn 't make it any less palatable .
in a world where john carpenter 's the fog still exists , i cannot think of a single valid reason to watch this .
an all-round boondoggle of the first order .
has there ever been an uglier animated feature ? the eerie , fever-dream-like faux three-dimensionality , the cyborg-like humanoids , the septic , etiolated colors .
why was (national lottery) money poured into a film where an elderly man says 'thank you ' before having his fingers hammered ? still less one where we then see his head pulped .
couldn 't make up its mind whether to do slapstick or more sophisticated brand of comedy and sadly , wasn 't that good at either .
cinematically , it 's like watching your lawn grow .
anderson 's offering is never quite accessible or empathetic enough , and with a romance we struggle to believe in , it deems this particular project something of a failure .
cats is a strange beast to begin with , but the combination of strange cgi makes the translation from stage to screen even worse .
no amount of star power can pump life into such an inert offering .
badagascar .
absolutely awful in every department; even cosby quickly disowned it
vita & virginia just can 't overcome its faults and succumbs to being another well-made period piece that misses its mark .
[b]leach this one fully out of sight and mind .
the plot is as boring as it is baffling and the dialogue might well have been translated into english via a free iphone app .
exasperation eventually morphs into unrelenting pain , and there 's not a single , solitary laugh to be had .
this isn 't boring , but is as predictable as can be .
[t]here are times when it feels as if writer/director cameron crowe simply started filming with the basic outline of a screenplay that had yet to be written .
kevin hart seems to spend lingering moments of this witless tosh looking like he is making it all up on the spot , constantly trying to stay afloat when even he knows night school is dead in the water .
another step down in will ferrell 's career path
three films into the ongoing divergent series , one would hope we 'd moved beyond laying plates and folding napkins to get to something more substantial . yet allegiant barely makes it to the appetizer course .
jet li and dmx duke it out with an assortment of thugs as if they were slowly making their way to the final stage of super mario bros .
with movies like this is it a wonder that all theaters have lacked for most of the summer was the occasional tumbleweed to complete the illusion of their being ghost towns ?
crude , dumb spoof isn 't worth your time or money .
a misfire from start to finish , a waste of a prodigious amount of talent .
a brain-dead action flick if there ever was one .
some films are ripped from the headlines , others are ripped from the pages of cosmopolitan .
grossing out your audience isn 't going to solve your problems and make your film work .
the sort of eighties teensploitation falderal that wasn 't good to begin with and is somewhere just north of repugnant now .

"your highness" is . . . built on a flimsy house of profane cards that begins crumbling with the opening narration and never recovers .
if the sprawling , ugly , largely incomprehensible mess of king arthur: legend of the sword is anything to go by , guy ritchie has now consolidated his status as the worst "a list" director working today .
will steve martin ever be funny in a movie again ?
a walter mitty approach to justify the decadent and pathetic life of charlie sheen
poorly made and just stupid .
fall leans too heavily in the direction of vain and smug .
a strange , angry attack on modernity that feels like the result of a group of bitter men griping about the metrosexualisation of a younger generation .
can someone please put this inane car-chase thriller back on the shelf ?
this story would have worked if it only ran for 20 minutes instead of the painful 84 i had to sit through .
a bargain-bin cockadoodie pseudo-misery , a disgraceful waste of the brilliant octavia spencer . has no interest in women 's pain and trauma even as it appropriates it for entertainment purposes .
the action is mired by the lacklustre plot , which zigzags between bland backstory and the sluggish progress of the bratty chimp .
you can see what they are striving for , but georgia rule is so artificial , it feels like more of a flow chart than a slice of life .
if you watch closely during john stockwell 's godawful shark-attack thriller , you can see halle berry 's oscar sinking ever so slowly into the waters off cape town .
a catastrophe of bad acting , ludicrous science and conspicuously cheap special effects that can 't even follow its own internal logic from one scene to the next .
flavorless . . . unappetizing . . . torture
a romantic comedy is supposed to be fanciful and fun . this is neither . nor is it sexy .
monsters versus robots . . with no room for characters or story or anything other than shiny metal and roaring bulk .
the bye bye man is the rare bad movie whose staggering level of ineptitude is practically a recommendation .
best-case scenario with snatched is that you are kidnapped and taken from the theater during a screening . worst case is you are kidnapped and forced to watch this total mess .
it 's lost and confused , with its baffling plot turns and character motivations presented in a straightforward , dead-eyed manner .
the problem is that this movie shares screen-time with a mid-2000s shock comedy . hardly five minutes go by without something gross or disgusting happening .
it is a lousy movie and hepburn 's performance , after some strikingly enigmatic opening moments , is embarrassingly bad .
assassin 's creed is easily the worst movie fassbender and cotillard have ever participated in .
last blood is an exercise in excessively gory violence and dubious political action moviemaking that adds little of value to the rambo property .
even if you added a laugh track the tone is glum .
in a show that at least has its brevity going for it , drew barrymore and ben stiller are wasted in "duplex ." its badly constructed plot collapses after the movie goes from silly to tasteless .
the overall result of this remake is something as safe and dull as oatmeal .
where seven seemed to radiate diabolical evil , saw just radiates idiocy .
nothing comes as a surprise , and viewers will be pondering how certain things managed to occur -- especially involving the villain 's apparent super-human strength .
the story plods along , punctuated by gags that are more silly than inventive .
instantly forgettable .
if you don 't know every single plot point and twist after the first twenty minutes , you 've done the sensible thing and left after the first ten .
lacks flavor , laughs and insight .
i couldn 't get past the feeling that this was basically the director 's softcore material masquerading as a feature film
restless is just as relentlessly whimsical and calculated as it sounds . the big surprise , however , is just how dreadfully acted , written and , yes , directed this clunker truly is .
the kids finally soften cube 's heart (and vice versa) , get mom to see past his scowl and into his kind heart , and become a wholesome unit that makes this a distastefully fit and formulaic family film .
despite the best efforts of tiffany haddish and rose byrne , like a boss strains for laughs and rarely gets them .
what could have been endearingly daft remains merely forgettable .
streep gets the basics but her performance beyond that is just as tone-deaf and filled with histrionics as the film itself .
doesn 't add anything fresh or special or memorable to our understanding of the grief process .
absolutely atrocious , silent hill is probably the worst movie ever to be based on a video game .
a puzzling misfire . like a pilot for a tv show you 'd never want to watch .
it may just be a kid 's movie , but in some ways that makes kart racer 's incredible lack of originality even more of a crime .
it 's a film that tries so hard at being lifelike that it forgets to be entertaining .
rad is a tedious exercise of endurance that has nothing to do the number of bunny hops achieved .
the last knight is the worst transformers movie of them all .
hopefully , i 've now prevented three people from seeing this film , and now they will each prevent three other people from doing the same .
spade will be a former grownup star if he can 't find funnier material than this .
this movie is awesomely stupid , totally implausible from a scientific viewpoint , and a shameful waste of money .
director david f . sandberg remains a horror guy at heart (lights out , annabelle: creation) , and the ping-ponging between yuks and yikes leads to a pretty nasty case of aesthetic whiplash .
like a +-size episode of sliders .
moore apparently can 't make his mind which of two competing visions of america is the right one
the movie is a near-relentless intellectual muddle , throwing out signifiers and metaphors lazily and to no particular effect .
there 's a whole lotta healing in the secret life of bees . big racial issues too . and down-home heartwarming platitudes set to acoustic guitar ballads by female singers .
a sloppy movie that glorifies endangering people on our city streets and interstates .
flaunts lame ghetto and dark-side-of-suburbia clichés in self-loathing standstill after self-loathing standstill , none of which offer a genuinely insightful perspective on modern living .
delivers only pitiful pratfalls and parents-having-sex jokes that are well past their sell-by date .
he 's creepy , offensive and irritating .
a big case of wasted potential .
director and screenwriter s . craig zahler 's third film is sordid and passive , resulting in scenes that end up disrespecting the audience 's intelligence . [full review in spanish]
teens continue to flock to crystal lake and jason vows that vengeance will again be his .
there is a moment late in the picture where one almost envies the position of the deceased - because at least she has been provided some level of escape .
the moment of the film when you should be going "oh my god i can 't believe it ," you 're thinking , "i wonder if we could sneak into the end of beverly hills chihuahua ."
for a film that wants desperately to wring comedy from the narcissism and neuroses of hollywood filmmakers it 's neither funny or particularly insightful .
you 'll find more startling dystopias in the average ken loach film .
what will they do next ? probably rip more people off . it 's worked for them so far .
i would rather just see more hangover mysteries . it 's an inherently funny setup with limitless (see what i did there ?) permutations to explore . and mark my words , they still will .
scouts guide to the zombie apocalypse is neither scary enough to be a horror movie nor funny enough to be a comedy .

a muddled spiritual thriller!
berg uses his skilful eye to engulf this film with his trademark excellence in action and violence but mostly just to distract from the nonsensical and incoherent script .

full review at movies for the masses
if you liked the original , you 'll hate the sequel and everyone involved in the making of it .
implausible , utterly ridiculous , and absolutely unfunny .
in 1939 , it [dialogue] was hip and maybe even scandalous . . .that type of talk and the behavior of these characters crossed the oldie-moldy line somewhere in the early 1970s .
would be scary if it weren 't so stupid .
you can almost see the moment when the super-talented saoirse ronan checks out in terms of character and i think james gandolfini gave up before the end of rehearsal . i just felt bad for alexis bledel .
it 's not karate now , it 's kung fu . why not call it the kung fu kid ?
the struggle to reconcile the star-is-born theatre arc with the meat of kildare 's investigation pushed me out of the movie entirely .
the bye bye man is like someone watched a double-bill of the babadook/it follows and said "i can do that!" but indeed cannot .
i 'm not sure exactly why i 'm protecting the shocking twist , because it certainly doesn 't deserve to be protected .
as beth is adam 's societal guide dog , instructing him on how he should react , the filmmakers turn to dopey ballads in order to steer us through plot points rife with the emotional complexity of jell-o .

a 150-minute simulation of life in a garbage disposal .
the ghost dimension isn 't so much scary as it is aggressive , constantly assaulting viewers with sudden monsters and loud noises .

a moment where brosnan quietly retracts his fishing pole says volumes about the sadness at the so-to-speak root of this testosterone opera .
the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list .
those hoping for an unintended laugh riot will be disappointed to learn that slender man is mostly just a flabbergasting bore .
the reader is a cloaked male fantasy , in which a milf hides under spinster garb -- all for a 16-year-old 's delight .
the only moments of terror in this ostensible horror flick are brought about by the appearance of the words 'producer: meg ryan , ' giving you chills in a way that only those words can .
it must have been a pretty weak year for subtitled fare if the oscar voters sought to praise this inert , inept epic .
let 's just hope that final destination 3 really is the final entry in this successful but intellectually bankrupt horror franchise .
griffin dunne and dirk wittenborn think they 're pretty clever .
with an arbitrary title and a lazy everything else , rage is as bland as a "gritty" thriller can be
the film has already reduced itself to an empty exercise in campy , color-bathed titillation , as a gaggle of women are defined by their sexual drives and abilities without comment from the filmmaker .
not worth seeing
prom night boils down to an obsessed maniac (johnathon schaech) on the loose with a knife and a disappointingly routine , matter-of-fact plot that just doesn 't cut it .
this movie is so cheesy and beefy they ought to sell it at taco bell .
there is so much wrong with slackers , it may be more efficient simply to point out the one acceptable ingredient: jason schwartzman .
you 'll have more fun staying at home .
while nice to look at , it 's also a very tedious slice of magical realism lacking in tension , suspense and , indeed , magic .
as it passed the two-hour mark , i began to fear the ending might never actually end . that it finally did was one of the movie 's highlights .
a convoluted and incoherent political thriller meant to get lost in netflix 's vast catalogue . [full review in spanish]
this is truly terrible: a cost-cutting british action thriller with clunky script , wooden acting , uncertain directing , cheapo-looking interiors and the most outrageously obvious and rubbish "twist" reveal at the end .
the biggest sin committed by flatliners is its complete and utter dullness . it 's the cinematic equivalent of drying paint .
oedekerk 's latest exercise in what i like to call 'the cinema of screechy hellsuck . '
a punishing 110 minutes of flatulence , diarrhea , bad malapropisms , infantile sex gags and gross-out jokes that are gross without the impediment of actually being funny .
minus a shred of farrelly wit .
an unfunny , unimaginative movie .
it 's not even a real movie .
lacks inventiveness in any single fibre of its being - and worse , it 's dull .
a disappointing comedy that falls down thanks to an uneven tone , some badly misjudged jokes , a failure to connect on an emotional level and a script that largely wastes the talents of its proven comic cast .
everything about this film is fairly offensive , including its racial stereotypes , homophobia , misogyny , generally bad writing and amateur filmmaking .
the kind of bad that can only be appreciated by those who have seen the "faithful" three-hour straight-to-video adaptation of h .g . wells ' the war of the worlds
the movie is at least 20 minutes too long . actually , it 's 107 minutes too long .
it 's always a shock when a movie turns out to be this bad .
jeepers creepers 2 supplies us with a first-class creature , a fourth-rate story , and dialogue possibly created by feeding the screenplay into a pasta maker .
a story that is a bramble bush of incompatible plot lines , treatments , and situations that do nothing but prove the existence of chaos theory at its most irritating
[the film] contains third-rate acting , anemic special effects , an unexceptional story and sickening violence . if it is to be seen at all , it should be for the kinetic martial-arts finale .
so didactic that viewers are likely to feel less uplifted than lectured .
from its black-and-white presentation to its minimalist construction the film cries out arthouse , but there 's a sense it 's trying way too hard .
a witless , droning bore .
so misconceived , so shrill , so fetishy is oliver stone 's epic , so unintentionally hilarious a stew of paganism and freudianism , that it makes conan the barbarian look like gladiator .
a disordered and unfocused ghost story that bears all the very worst habits of the genre .
the movie is a harmless kitsch but is quite entertaining . of course , miss rice is called to become a true movie star . (complete review in spanish in the mexican newspaper reforma) .
it makes me feel cheated and sad .
behind enemy lines is so effective as chest-beating nationalism you might forgive the filmmakers for offensively turning a bosnian grave site into a whacky set piece .
there 's a vainglorious gratuity to the gory scenes in only god forgives that makes them , whisper it quietly . . .a touch boring .
alyson hannigan makes an adorable lead , but date movie only succeeds in making you feel sorry for her and wishing that someone would cast her in a proper romcom .
what 's most enlightening about bad boys 2 is this: you 'll never see a better example of filmmakers ' contempt for their audience .
in my movie fridge , the ice harvest packs in far beneath iceman , the ice storm and the iceman cometh . it suffers freezer burn even below ice palace and ice station zebra .
[hemsworth] spends much of the film tapping away on keyboards , frequently looking down at his hands - no , really , the expert computer hacker looks at his hands to type .
too much of a morbid soap opera to be any fun or truly dramatic .
definitely one of the worst films of the year .
despite a raft of a-list cameos , director robert rodriguez fails to serve up enough laughs to justify a second helping of danny trejo 's mexican hardman .
it would be best appreciated by (a) children of blind , castrated , hearing-impaired hollywood executives suffering from tourette 's syndrome and arrested development , (b) comic actor-writers who look like richard simmons .
i almost hate to have to say this but the farrellys might be better off going back to their rude-and-crude roots instead of mucking around with this sensitivity business .
king 's ransom deserves to be bashed , burned , and have its ashes scattered over hollywood
you 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee 's character didn 't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
it is possible to support the journalistic ideal that no stoning should be left unturned while also championing better storytelling .
plays like an amateur-acting exercise in which each participant picks a name and a couple of defining props .
regrettable .
maybe [adam] green intended to parody how low-rent and awful slasher sequels usually are . if so , the joke 's on his audience .
though the title guarantees uplift , this gruelling drama spends an hour dragging you into a well of depression .
where is the "x" rating when we need it! violence is often more pornographic than sex .
try as you might to magic up bill bixby from the 70s ' tv series the magician , it just ain 't going to happen .
watching the turkey in the oven would be more entertaining .
his embalmed drama is a ghost from the '80s , a decade that regularly produced surprise-free , caramelized biopics . the airless amelia is missing practically everything .
a dark pastiche of murky drug deals and menacing thugs sans the tongue-in-cheek humor and neon nights of television 's crayola-washed classic .
a better life is one of those modest movies that is so outwardly well-intentioned that one cannot help but doubt its intentions .
the film equivalent of eating one of those circular rice wafer things that taste like nothing .
an orphan of both mod and the post-mod with nothing at all to say for itself .
a few more movies like norbit and eddie murphy won 't have a fanbase to kick around anymore .
uniformly badly acted down to a loaf of bread , this eye-bleedingly stupid and witless movie is proof that just because someone is considered an icon doesn 't mean she should be allowed near movie cameras .
the screenplay (based on nicci french 's novel) is cringeworthy , and kaige 's inability to spot when english-speaking thesps are reciting rather than acting produces scenes that vary from lifeless to laughable .
a lighthearted romp about sexual abuse , alcoholism , and familial angst , and , as if that weren 't bad enough , the movie wants to be taken seriously .
a neutered , paint-by-numbers snoozefest .
eternal is the kind of horror movie where the only horror is a misplaced vase .
full review at movies for the masses
a dog 's breakfast of clashing ideas and concepts; it 's confused and confusing , and the more it tries to untangle itself , the deeper it digs itself into an incoherent hole .
despite ample proof to the contrary , hoodwinked too! hood vs . evil was not written by the punaholic carrie bradshaw .
. . .for die-hard fans of the series only . and i 'm sure they , too , will be sorely disappointed . nothing new , nothing original , nothing innovative has been added to the recipe .
the screenwriter daniel waters has some funny films to his name , but sex and death 101 is not one of them .
a new low point in shyamalan 's crumbling career .
a buddy film about overcompensating characters that seems to have also been made by overcompensating comedians .
criminal is a perfectly passable thriller , if you 're cool with no one here passing as an actual human being .
basically planes , trains and automobiles with robert downey jr . and zach galifianakis , - the earned sentiment and john hughes cred .
bad movie . bad career move . bad in all respects .
it 's an action-comedy-mystery-thriller that manages to spectacularly fail at all the above , an algorithmic abomination that 's as coldly constructed as it is clumsily made .
look out for a star cameo -- it 's the only surprise you 'll get from this heap .
another misfire for brad pitt . this hit man story is overly talkative and lacking in entertainment value
the saddest thing about jack & jill is that we allowed adam sandler to get to this point .
the female lead only says one word during worlds away: "help" . i know exactly how she feels .
it 's not as bad as it sounds . it 's much worse .
the heady whirl of the roses ' first album played loud is a treat -- the only one .
happy valentine 's day , everyone! don 't spend it watching endless love .
hoping for a good scare while watching this mess really is like pulling teeth .
the majority of the movie 's gags are staged so blandly that you 're more likely to wince than laugh .
pure unadulterated garbage
i was cursed with having to watch this buttock-numbing twaddle , through which you spend most of the time wondering which is worse -- the truly appalling script or the dreadful supporting performances .
. . .strictly for kids . . .
a poor fit for anyone . and that includes even the undiscriminating gorehounds looking for yet another bloody slice of payback .
considering how many great films have been influenced by brooks ' earlier work , it 's hard to believe how badly this movie fails .
alternately laughable and sleep-inducing , the order shows that the team behind a knight 's tale was not just a one-trick pony . they have plenty more bad movies up their sleeves .
flat , rickety and enervated .
complain as loudly as you like about oliver stone - his politics , posturing and relationship with the facts - but until now he hasn 't directed a film that 's flat-out dull .
even the title is lazy .
the pitch meeting must have gone something like this: "has anyone here seen manhunter ? good . neither has the rest of america ."
a cinematic hash of stale ingredients .
the dialogue is shrill , the emotional moments are foghorned with deafening musical cues , and every scene is lit like an advert for orange juice .
it 's a true rubber-necker 's delight , a comedy so inconceivably tacky that it will make you question whether or not you 're laughing at the film or with it .

mctiernan and the talent-deprived buffoons who wrote the remake took away the futurism and stripped most of the social satire from this cautionary tale .

an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
the occasional one-liner is wasted amid a sea of clichés and preposterous situations in this duff vehicle that forgot to put the romance in romantic comedy .

the movie is as fleeting as the last weekend of summer .
the predator is a thorough grab bag of averageness , made worse by its distinct lack of distinction .
i don 't think i 've ever seen someone ralph in super-slo-mo while riding a mechanical bull before , so kudos for originality there , i guess .
neeson and fiennes are so serious here you would have thought they were auditioning for a "schindler 's list" sequel .
sound . fury . nonsense . a franchise is born . beats me what moviegoers thought they hadn 't seen a hundred times before in this one-man buddy film .
never coming close to achieving the level of laughably bad , the dry and ludicrous stigmata never rises above painfully bad .
seems terribly confused about whether it wants to be literary drama or out-and-out satire .
it 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
the words is horrible , a smug , self-satisfied piece of over-plotted nonsense that is horribly written and decently acted . stay far , far away .
two finger-drumming hours of puffed-up , prancing tripe , that couldn 't have been any more irritating if the lead role was played by that bellowing go compare fatso .

so bad it makes the notebook look like casablanca .
pixar 's first true disaster , which totally fails to understand what was good about the first film , or what 's great about pixar itself .
even if the mismatched singing and dancing weren 't overly annoying , the character designs and plot are noticeably mediocre for the disney standard .
this reductive revenge thriller preaches at the same time it panders to base payback fantasies .
most of halim 's script is a laundry list of offensive remarks that he no doubt means to serve as titillating spoof , but none of it 's funny or even the least bit provocative , just offensive .
what a bore , don 't spawn peter sellers!
the dialogue is ridiculous and the action dull . robin hood is now stealing from anyone who buys a ticket , rich or poor .
the action sequences never quite attain the level of thrilling , though jonathan rhys-meyers boldly vamps it up as the (very tightly) leather-clad villain of the piece
this self-directed vanity project shows the actor as a decent bloke who keeps in touch with his old mates from home , but that goodwill is squandered by earnest interviews with fellow petrolheads .
perry isn 't the only thing wrong with serving sara , but he 's the thing that takes a pleasantly mediocre movie and turns it into an unpleasantly mediocre one .

"lady in the water" can be summed up thusly: hook , line and stinker .
frequently pauses to shower someone with vomit , pus , urine or excrement . it should be called meet the bodily fluids .
it 's never a good thing to find yourself laughing during a horror thriller , particularly one with a menacing title like saw . but laugh , laugh , laugh you will .
there isn 't a genuinely frightening or interesting moment here .

an emotionally empty , thematically ill-defined , and listless affair . it is never able to communicate the complexity of the woman at its center .
simon pegg is a very talented comic actor , but you would never guess that in this claustrophobic , strained stream-of-consciousness , sinking cinematic showboat .
it was directed by tibor takacs . oh , you don 't know him ? well then you didn 't watch his earlier stab at cinema , mansquito , which is the greatest tv movie of all time .
jaw-droppingly abysmal . seldom has a major star embarrassed himself so badly .
the one intriguing thing about john carpenter 's ghosts of mars is how such a dreadful screenplay could have made it onto celluloid .

what a disappointment .
welcome to adulthood , hillary and haylie duff . here are your t-mobile sidekicks and tabloid news stories . leave your personalities at the door .
on the screen , it seems to be like a walking corpse itself: jerking around malevolently , with putrefying limbs , a fixed , grisly smile on its face and absolutely no spontaneity .
a tedious , two-hour crisis of conscience , presenting a myriad of choices - the best of which is to wait and see this on dvd , if at all .
if only there were some imagination at work here rather than the slash-and-bleed approach splashed across the screen in varying shades of vermillion
the film was scripted by david s . ward , who also wrote the original but added nothing new or special to this sequel .
it 's just another lousy piece of brand name recycling .

if you want a good thriller about a weirdo who creates trouble for a family . . . rent "cape fear ." either version .
the insipid high school comedy fist fight celebrates and exploits the very ideas that it should be ridiculing for comic effect .
take your date to this laugh-less stinker and it may be your last .
it is an audacious writer who sizes up this material and decides "more backstory" is the way to go . it is a pained audience who must endure the result .
this john cusack-driven exercise in scorched-earth political comedy is neither as dark nor as timely as intended , and certainly not as funny .
this one really should have been immediately relegated to the discount bin .
jack black is just bill murray without the talent and wit , while ben stiller doesn 't get a chance to shine in this one .
whatever reasons led to the creation and release of this sorry excuse for entertainment , parents looking for some weekend fun with the little ones can safely steer clear of kangaroo jack .

due date joins furry vengeance and i 'm still here on the list of the year 's worst movies .

i wanted to champion a sweet locally filmed movie and tell you all to hunt it down . sadly i cannot .

you should avoid this movie as if it were radioactive .
badly directed , poorly written and ultimately scare-free british horror flick that looks embarrassingly cheap and completely wastes its talented cast .

malkovich has built a career mumbling his way through one disastrous movie after another , but this time he 's got company .
utterly lifeless and dull and quite simply hard to sit through .
for those weary few of us who harbour an allergy to vaughn 's deliberately obnoxious style , each movie feels like an insult - one added to a heap of computer-generated injuries .
truly abysmal and half-hearted attempt to keep this particular cash-boat afloat . where 's the john landis i remember ?

once again , it is proven that "snl" sketches are probably best left in new york , live , on a saturday night .
a horror movie franchise that has sunk to the lower depths of self-parody .
i 've always loved parody . it 's too bad that garbage like this is what passes for it these days .
what will creatively-bankrupt hollywood think of next ? how about a remake of slumdog millionaire , only set in an l .a . barrio with an all-chicano cast ? i shouldn 't give them any ideas .
horror aficionados may appreciate some of its stagings and detail , but for anyone seeking more than just meaningless blood and guts being spewed there 's no reason to give i saw the devil a look .
um dos piores trabalhos de almodóvar , aqui totalmente entregue à auto-indulgência , ao melodrama barato e às caricaturas (o que não é novidade) , mas sem a sensibilidade costumeira que normalmente contrabalança seus excessos .

the art of storytelling is both of distinct narrative interest and personal issue in the latest payload of calcified nonsense from one of modern cinema 's oddest would-be auteurs .
weak ya adaptation is far more mature than the books .
at its best , it refuses to take itself seriously and literally winks at us . but more often , it derives laughs unintentionally .
poseidon recognizes and encourages belief in the popular popcorn-movie theory of the survival of the whitest .
[smith 's] tedious foul-mouthed dialogue . . . seems more obnoxious than ever when it brings action and suspense sequences to a grinding halt .
this was easily the least plausible and most nonsensical film i saw on this particular screening day and bear in mind that when i saw it , it was followed by "the three stooges ."
fifty shades darker just does not shine .
a woeful , sloppy , misbegotten load of crap . in other words , it makes its two predecessors look like examples of modern cinematic masterpieces in comparison .
this is perfect entertainment for those who find 'teletubbies ' and 'dora the explorer ' to be a little too highbrow .
worst movie of the summer
it 's unoriginal , frequently incomprehensible and cheaply made , and moviegoers should avoid theaters that show this film just to eliminate the chance of walking in accidentally .
if italians had their own term for 'schmaltzy ' , this awful , derivative and painfully cringeworthy piece of steaming crap would be the most loathsome example of such an adjective .
a disaster film that goes blub blub in the night .
third-world propaganda
i think it 's safe to say releasing zack snyder 's cut of this film will give audiences the better product
give this wannabe cinderella a big bibbitti bobbitti boo .
ill-conceived .
a safe , self-congratulatory fantasy which revisits the civil rights era not for a valuable history lesson but for an escapist , syrupy sweet , sing-a-long trip down memory lane to an unrecognizable , hollywood utopia that never existed .
even by disney channel standards , this sequel is weak and shrill and not at all fun .
an se pio sygkratimeno (pros harin prosomoiosis realismoy) aytoteles spin-off toy sex and the city
we 're the country that gave the world jazz and abstract expressionism and orson welles . we invented basketball and hip-hop . now we export adolescent comedy garbage and hope the world won 't notice .
as the movie becomes increasingly violent and unpleasant , the characters chase around after each other in a threadbare gangster plot about a trunk of gold .
black 's narcissistic , obsessive , stunted dan is so careless about all his relationships - with his wife , son , boss - that you wonder how he ever had them in the first place .
. . .a lot of torture-p0rn aficionados are going to be throwing their money away , and that 's always funny .
it 's a film so terrifically inept , on so many levels of direction , performance and intent , that it demands and receives its audience 's full , stunned attention .
the worst thing ? it 's all hysterical and histrionic , and yet completely dull . i 'm not certain how one manages that .
the only attempt at stretching the wooden characters involves middle daughter jan being teed off at perfect older sister marcia and throwing a few fits . we smile the first time .
a deformed composite of every buddy comedy ever made , sliced and diced to the point of total anonymity . the characters aren 't buddies and the premise isn 't comedic .
i would say i feel bad for a cast that 's clearly above this material , but at least they got paid for it; i ended up in the red .
unspeakably bad dialogue delivered by excruciatingly bad actors in a plot so illogical and stupid it kills unicorns .
how anyone else could sit through its 2 1/2 hours and not drop at least a dozen iq points is beyond my comprehension . particularly now that i 've seen it .
opens with a close-up of [zohan 's] bulging crotch and remains in that territory , in every sense , for the 113 minutes that it violates the screen
any way you put it , it is not worth the price of admission .
this cautionary tale about science without boundaries goes to such lengths to "cross the line" narratively that it leaves the big questions behind .
the actual lucky ones will be sitting in a different movie theater , watching anything but this .
there are laughs in balls , but not nearly enough of them .
a strange look at what leatherface and his clan came to be- can 't help wondering if henkel even remembers the original .
these are presumably independent young adults - most of the lead actresses are in their 30s now - continuing to wrestle with 18-year-old problems . and when they finally take the stage , it 's hard to care .
just another threadbare , gravely puerile james bond movie but marketed directly at your children . . . which is something to think about .
a succession of decisions aimed at mitigating fans ' malicious whims . [full review in spanish]
here is a portrait of a character so sad and hapless , so hard to like , so impossible to empathize with , that watching it feels like an act of unkindness .
the random , hectic storyline has little rhyme or reason , the unimaginative 3d feels like a rip-off and only clemens seems to be taking this seriously .
this latest remake or reboot (does anyone truly know the difference ?) feels less alive than undead .
dismal , frequently dull , badly written european animation that squanders its talented cast (and james corden) , fails to include any decent jokes and mangles its central eco-friendly message .
trite and boring portrait of rich and self-absorbed women .
the tone of the acting , which is set by mr . grammer 's blandly laid-back performance , is all wrong for a genre that demands over-the-top hamming .
simply put , zoolander no . 2 is a disaster . it is witless . it is forced . worst of all , it lacks a key component: story .
'the paperboy" can 't decide whether to be an unfunny sex comedy , a half-hearted detective story or a woeful race drama - so it decides to be all three . . .
a joyless and humorless cash-in that bears little resemblance to the 2009 original except by name .
it is one of the signs of the apocalypse , so i must warn you ahead of time . the smurfs are skateboarding and rapping in this movie .
jesse eisenberg and kristen stewart were great together in adventureland , so stay home this weekend and rent that instead .
shinier , but no less disgusting .
only tobin bell is given much emotional variance and , as a result , only tobin bell makes any impression at all .
farrelly , quite simply put , does not appear to have the slightest clue about comic timing .
i never walk out in the middle of a film , but with another day in paradise , i came pretty darn close .
if the intention is to transport the audience to a world we 've never seen , mission accomplished . you 'll either find it extremely creative or an insufferable bore .
with a title like this , shouldn 't jason todd ipson 's comedy celebrate italian culture ? instead , it aggressively insults the heritage it pretends to admire .
the film 's eventual conclusion seems like little reward after nearly two hours of soul-searching dialogue .
infinitely small , petty , cruel; appallingly sociopathic even grading on the dumpster-fire-horror-flick curve . but forget the supernatural element: the human 'drama ' is the most ridiculous thing here .
the fact that see no evil 's serial stalker is only slightly more horrifying than , say , sloth from the goonies is not exactly a good thing .
essentially a feature-length tv commercial featuring glossy images of people at work and at play .
poor execution of a great concept . why doesn 't englund ever meet freddy ? why aren 't there more movie refernces ? has langencamp '
all the fine actors , narrative subversions and dusty landscapes in the world can 't save a film that thinks it 's saying a lot without saying much at all .
comedy is difficult , but it seems like mad money didn 't even try . it 's very hard to find the jokes .
a film full of emotional false notes , bad dialogue and cardboard characters . . .
shields is not a natural comic performer , to say the least . her face has the comic mobility and expressiveness of an easter island statue .

[a] stale , schmaltzy and testosterone-drenched comedy .
woefully dull-witted .

one of the few good things to be said about assault on precinct 13 is that , early in the new season , we get one of the year 's worst movies over and done with .
chandni chowk to china supposedly is the 'the first-ever bollywood kung-fu comedy , ' which makes me pray fervently that it will also be the last .
based on l . frank baum 's little-known pussyhound of oz .
watching show dogs is simultaneously uncomfortable and embarrassing . why was this movie made . . . for children ?
it boggles the mind that after six years of silence , all tarantino has to offer is this garbage .
looks and feels like one big , long commercial .
it fails utterly as a horror picture , although it delivers plenty of pg-13-rated flesh and unintentional laughs .
1000-percent ridiculous .
one wonders why slow burn wasn 't just dumped completely .
secret window is filled with so many red herrings , one could have a veritable feast if one were to filet them , cream them , and serve them with a box of crackers .
the film is a polemic against the death penalty , which may be a reasonable position , but played out as a mystery/thriller it 's silly , and often embarrassing .
this mean-spirited revenge story would once have starred cole hauser 's father , veteran b-movie psycho wings hauser , and played grindhouses and drive-ins . and it would have been a far more entertaining picture .
a fossilized abomination , thankfully relegated to the bygone decade which spawned it .
writer-director carter smith got his start as a successful fashion photographer . but you wouldn 't know it from the murky look of this generic thriller .
all the cute scenes and montages , leading inexorably to redemption and reconciliation , could have been generated by screenwriting software .

their spy-prying . . .and displays of lunkheaded brawn . . .aren 't endearing; they 're horrifying , in ways there 's no coming back from . [blu-ray]

a barely written action-thriller about an american family hunted by faceless dudes with machetes in a never-identified southeast asian country .
may the saw mini-franchise , dulled into a bloody gore-fest bore after only three installments , rest in piece . a piece of hack-sawed-off foot here , a piece of a bludgeoned limb there .
you 'd think a film so heavy on sorcery and swordfights couldn 't go wrong , but conan the barbarian manages the twin feats of being both derivative and deathly dull .
more dull than upsetting -- repetitive than worth condemnation .
if star ryan reynolds wants to scare us , why not just lock us in a room and make us watch van wilder over and over ? or have girlfriend alanis morissette talk about her past relationships ?
since the film 's characters talk endlessly about being honest , it might be nice if the film had a little more honesty itself .
an entirely needless followup to the ring and the ring two . . .
anyone who has seen the infinitely superior shampoo will recognize what spreads out before us in spread .
a movie without a redeeming feature: a black hole where laughter goes to die .
there 's no getting around how inadequate wiig and mccarthy are . the breakout here is snl star mckinnon , who needs co-stars who could keep up with her .
another reason not to get the 'supernatural package ' at the one-hour photo .

to be fair , benigni does the best he can with the supremely unfunny material .

. . .almost the same gang of dimwits are up to the same shenanigans , with thailand substituting for vegas .
billy boyd 's distinctly un-pippin turn as a psycho drug dealer aside , there 's little of interest in this misjudged , miswritten mess .
mercifully , it only runs 89 minutes .
it may sound strange to say that this is another boring action film , but it 's true .
everything in any day is portentous and presented as if it is loaded with meaning; none of it is , because everything is either so obvious or so arbitrary that nothing actually means anything .
a kill
miley cyrus makes a pathetic attempt to demonstrate her non-existent dramatic skills in this latest nicholas sparks-penned story .
while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .
reflects the mentality of great swaths of artless , ignorant slobs .
the emphasis placed on indoctrination , enslavement and superior alien intelligence brings the film troublingly close to subliminal propaganda , while the script is so banal you 'd have to be brainwashed to enjoy it .
. . .nothing but a sappy , shameless , and morbid production that wastes talent and time in a script designed to line the bottom of a bird cage .
lucy is like a parody of pretentious filmmaking , only not as smart .
a trashy superhero comedy (in yawnsome 3d) that tries to reproduce the innocent charm of its origins as a 1930s radio serial .
it 's hard to walk into a film with the name "truth" without great expectations about its content . this one fails to meet any of those expectations .
the film is a drag - lightened up unintentionally by summers 's laughable prose .
it 's not just the sound of crickets you hear watching this movie . it 's the sound of dead crickets .
the russians have a word for it: nyet .
there 's no good reason for another rendition of john carpenter 's 1980 film about the ghosts of drowned lepers seeking revenge on the inhabitants of a seaside california town .
introduced a sadism that lurks beneath the surface of craven 's work to this day . it 's not fun , as horror should be; it 's amoral , and you leave it feeling sickened and dirty .
what uncaring parent would waste their children 's time taking them to see this nonsense ? . . . and what incriminating photos do the producers have of jon voight ?
half-hearted attempts to incorporate messages about god and faith don 't go much farther than people pointing at a bible .
so imperfect that it may qualify as one of the summer 's worst movies .
as problematic as the two leads are , they are inconsequential to this poorly written story
once the novelty of the film 's non-linear plot wears off , killing ground is mercilessly rote .
is this farce , drama , satire ? who knows ?
i can 't think of anything more dispiriting than a film consciously faking it for the so-bad-it 's-good market .
franco 's film really is awful , but it 's also weirdly watchable - if only for jovovich 's eye-popping turn and for the spectacle of waterhouse stomping through the desert with her catwalk-model strut .
this sort of tommyrot might make you cry , but so would getting smacked in the face with a bag of onions , which is what watching the movie is like .
the best thing that could happen for trolls would be to forget it completely . that would make me happy .

the duel is a forgettable , muddled affair that wastes its two charismatic leads on endless scenes of tonal wonkiness .
whereas wes craven 's '84 original kept you unsure as to whether you were witnessing dreams or reality , director samuel bayer 's remake color-codes the transitions . how helpful!
the film is a mess , only sporadically funny at best , but worst of all , it just plain smacks of desperation .
director paul w .s . anderson is one of hollywood 's most consistent directors - he can always be counted on to make a terrible movie .
posey continues to find work , and even in a movie as beneath her as this one is , she 's always fully engaged . the rest of blade: trinity is content to coast .
this is a terrible , terrible , terrible movie .
my goodness , this is tedious stuff -- smug , long-winded and , above all , wretchedly unfunny . . . which in a would-be comedy isn 't just unfortunate but pretty much disastrous .
low-end pornography that will titillate sickos who get off on seeing women and gays degraded and snuffed -- a movie without any redeeming social value .
overplotted and overscripted , this mess of a movie seems to have hundreds of characters and thousands of dead bodies .
it 's hard to get outraged about a movie this bad .
simpson steals the show -- which , admittedly , isn 't saying much considering her stiffest competition comes by way of a skateboarding bulldog .
stolen begins at overdetermined , makes a pit stop at outright sadistic and winds up in the parking garage of ridiculous even for a movie of this sort .

ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue .
terrible soap opera that not even the most ardent admirers of the most high-camp aspects of gay culture will find anything to their liking .
perhaps brian de palma was too blinded by his undoubtedly fervent feelings about the bush administration 's bungling of the invasion and occupation to make an honest appraisal of his message movie 's abundance of technical flaws .

in the four years since he was oscar-nominated for "127 hours ' ' - and disastrously co-hosted the academy awards ceremony - james franco has gone from one of our most exciting actors to an international joke .
abandon hope all ye who enter .
a relentlessly insulting and offensive flick which endeavors to redeem itself via 11th-hour moralizing ony after every frame up to the end had been a wholesale celebration of the debasement of females and the stereotyping of blacks .
. . . the only people who 'll remember it will be the ones cashing their checks afterward (or who 'll campaign a studio later to do another one of these turkeys) .
an emotionless , interminably slow tale exacerbated by washed out film that never captures the potential beauty of 18th century france and its costumes .
producer jennifer lopez 's cameo in the film 's climactic puerto rican day parade sequence feels like a victory lap for successfully bilking film financiers and moviegoers out of their money .

yours , mine & ours just might be mine , yours and everyone else 's most brutally obnoxious nightmare come to cinematic life .
[an] obnoxious , headache-inducing horror show .
torturously unfunny and thoroughly aggravating . . . the year is still young , but don 't be surprised if 'date movie ' is the worst film of 2006 .
not even a sexy , toned and blossomed blond can distract from the vapid ugliness that is the dukes of hazzard .
the two leads don 't have any chemistry , especially the flat , emotionless tucker .
one of the characters proclaims this will be "the greatest movie ever" , and you know it won 't be . even the 4-year old sitting behind me was dubious of that claim .
it 's surprising how rapidly the film devolves , especially when the opening scenes featured amusing nightmare sequences , eerie music , and gruesome gore effects .
what 's worse than the actual movie itself , though , is how indicative it is of modern group-think studio production .
it 's hard to conceive of how the film could make its argument any worse if d 'souza was deliberately attempting to overthrow the republican party from within .
there 's a dark , abiding mystery at the center of an american haunting , and it 's how on earth major stars such as donald sutherland and sissy spacek were talked into appearing in this film .
. . .one of the most incompetent and flat-out interminable biopics to come around in quite some time . . .
this is gross-out at it 's lamest . give it a pass .
for those who claim that if i don 't like a movie , they know it 's good -- has hollywood ever got a treat lined up here!
i passed on the special saw 3d glasses . that was my first mistake . maybe the special saw 3d glasses filtered out the suckiness .
full of attractive , listless actors who apparently couldn 't get jobs on any of the wb 's teen soap operas striking poses and mouthing dusty dialogue .
maybe there are only two kinds of people in this world . those who think larry the cable guy is funny , and those who do not . i am in the latter camp .
noteworthy solely for its thuddingly crude humor .
reprehensible and laughable .
the less said about this , the better .
here we have about 70 minutes worth of movie spread out over 111 mind-numbingly painful minutes of running time .
spike lee now seems to be trying to be the world 's oldest student filmmaker . take out the rookie mistakes from "red hook summer ," and there 'd be nothing left .
lifts shamelessly from gladiator and titanic , yet without an ounce of conviction or genuine feeling , the picture is oddly bereft of suspense but i think i know why . it 's because we couldn 't care less .
neither [carvey] nor semi-competent director perry andelin blake have the ability to sustain a scene or idea .
one of the least subtle motion pictures this year .
a truly laughable movie , one that takes itself far too seriously without ever taking a moment to consider who its audience is -- or if it even has one .
in the world of henry poole is here miracles exist , faith is the wisest operating principle and intelligent thought is everywhere discouraged .
the knot is the wedding movie to end all wedding movies - because if this isn 't the end of a trend , heaven help us .
the most unfunny and unnecessary film since jerry springer in ringmaster .
it 's getting so bad , you have to wonder if adam sandler doesn 't sit in his gazillion dollar mansion , flipping through scripts , looking for the worst possible piece of crap he can find .
it 's hard to imagine a worse movie will come out this year , and yet boll 's growing notoriety has already earned the trailer millions of hits on youtube . ed wood never had it so good .
quite possibly the world 's first horror-musical-sex-comedy , the strangely impressive originality of poultrygeist: night of the chicken dead doesn 't come even close to compensating for its everything-+-the-kitchen-sink midnight-movie awfulness .
like opening up a hallmark card and getting sprayed in the eyes with napalm .
even with its scant running time , this nightmarish travesty barrels along with all the whipcord speed and nimble comedic grace of a loved one 's funeral .
the filmmaker reportedly spent 11 years putting this film together - and for the unlucky viewer , sitting through this numbing and pointless work can seem like an 11-year stretch .
a hipster movie , affectedly exhausted and cocksure with no justification for it . and like anything hipster , you sort of want to kick it in the teeth .
'grind ' rather economically describes the experience for anyone above age 11 who wanders into this skateboarding 'rad ' retread for 'jackass ' fans .
a vigilante movie so sleazy and creepy it makes death wish look like a comedy .
the film feels as if hooper himself has nothing but contempt for the original and went out of his way to tear it down .
julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan .
in the name of the king would be irredeemable if not for its near-brilliant ability to give the viewer douche chills for 127 solid minutes .
literally has to be the worst 'event ' film ever made .
instead of delivering the equivalent of an airplane! , jerry zucker has made a monstrosity more akin to a plane crash .
it almost seems like they made things up as they went along .

i suppose bloodlust is enough excuse for anyone willing to endure 105 minutes of monster derby , but really: who are these characters ?
the actors obviously see the movie only as a paycheck , but the check should have a note at the bottom that says , 'shame on you! '
what transpires is everybody 's guess , and all of it leads to what may take the blue ribbon for the least exciting climax ever to festoon a horror picture .
another lethal boring and relentlessly inert load of self-indulgent twaddle cut from the same maddening bolt of existential cloth as the texas-based writer-director 's other pseudo box-office bombs . . .
hypocritical gleekaganda . . . makes justin bieber: never say never look like inception .
hits more spots than misses!
fails to offer even one compelling reason for its pathetic existence .
halfway through this live action version of the popular early 1980s kiddies tv show , i wondered what i had done wrong to deserve all this pain and suffering .
the wash is santo & johnny through a swamp of mounting disinterest .
has just about everything a snarky bad movie lover could want--that is , except a guy and two robots sitting in the bottom right hand corner .
a waste of stars , scenery , and setup .
. . .pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one .
this parody film plagiarizes spider-man to virtually laughless effect .
so lazy and so void of even the most rudimentary sense of storytelling that it showers the viewer with contempt . . .i 've never felt as abused by a filmmaker as i did in hot rod .
one of the most painfully bad films i have ever seen and an embarrassment for its star , al pacino .
save your time , save your money , save your soul . stay at home .
"royal bowels" aren 't the only thing that stinks in this terrible sci-fi film .
its protagonists , their situation and its mechanical but mushy resolution are never remotely believable .
a fiasco that never met a crass stereotype it didn 't milk for lowest-common-denominator laughs .
a horrible , unpleasant , infuriating movie no one should see
a virtually laugh-free comedy that puts a sad end to the woefully lackluster screen career of a talented comic .
it 's hard to imagine a worse movie will come out this year , and yet boll 's growing notoriety has already earned the trailer millions of hits on youtube . ed wood never had it so good .
an atrocious waste of time , this "night" is one you 'll quickly forget .
it stars pauly shore . 'nuff said .
this crude and unfunny comedy is easily the worst movie of 2012 .
if this is what teenagers want as entertainment , as a society , we 're in deeper trouble than we realize .
god 's not dead , but he might have a stroke if he sees this film . [full review in spanish]
jigsaw 's message will undoubtedly reach viewers--watching the film is the very definition of suffering .
this movie seems to me almost a mishmash of the worst bits that were left out of previous coen brothers outings .
reimagines a piece-of-shit novel as a piece-of-shit movie
one long series of narrative gotchas masquerading as moral or intellectual sophistication before finally revealing that it offers nothing more than world-weary sentimentality .
the problem with this numbskull travesty isn 't that it 's fatuous and smug (which it is) . it 's that it 's slack and dull .
as people have been saying lately , you can 't put lipstick on a pig . this movie shouldn 't star deniro and pacino . it should star corey haim and corey feldman .
though it 's intended as a follow-up to unbreakable , this one has earned the title 'unbearable ' - deserving of the coveted , rarely awarded distinction of zero stars .
ungodly awful .
this hopeless morass that has all the exuberance of damp lint and even less imagination .
we 've entered a golden age of movies that use state-of-the-art technology to rail against the use of state-of-the-art technology .
a spectacularly slapdash and wearingly half-hearted effort from the prolific writer-director-actor , lacking energy , structure or common sense .
georgia rule is not just a bad movie , it 's a creepy one .
an exploitative idea with mind-numbingly stupid behavior and zero explanation .
i would say that this was a complete and utter waste of time and talent , but , except for emma stone , i didn 't see any talent .
treats women like idiots and men like inflatable sex toys .
r .i .p .d . is so wrong-headed that the people who made it couldn 't even manage a decent rip-off of men in black; they decided to copy the abominable men in black 2 instead .
i don 't want to remember any more about legend than to make sure i include it in my ' 'worst films of 1986 ' ' list and never rent it when it comes out as a video cassette .
this borderline-pg-13 comedy demands the sort of sociological scrutiny that often has the moviegoer looking for a fun night out rolling her eyes . and granting norbit consideration feels like swinging a sledgehammer at a microbe .
by the end you can 't entirely be sure whether you have watched a film or participated in a eulogy for the careers of its participants .
saw 3d may just be the saw-iest saw film of them all .
[a] terrible third entry in a terrible trilogy .
even i could play against these guys and maybe win .
with alarmingly few exceptions . . . nothing that occurs can remotely be construed as humorous .
has no thrills , no chills , no scares and contains a villain , or several of them , actually , that will turn you to stone -- from boredom .
the thing is an unadulterated mess . the moments of entertainment that you get . . .get drowned in all the other detritus that bay brings to the table .
be sure to stay through the closing credits for a tag--not that it 's worth it , but i was the only one at my screening who did , and misery loves company .
. . .films like 'battlefield earth ' and 'the adventures of pluto nash ' await a film of this magnitude because it gets awfully lonely on the island of misfit movies .
oh yeah , the bee gees are much better than that other band .
we began this dismal movie season with one lethally bad world war ii romance -- pearl harbor -- and now we 're wrapping up with another howling dog , captain corelli 's mandolin .
easily the worst film so far this year .
how could this have been so completely messed up ? little boys playing with action figures could 've improvised a better story than this garbage .
tries to present itself as a comedy with some elements of satire , but it 's a complete misfire dragged down by a strange blend of grindhouse cinema that takes itself too seriously .
the buzz is wrong . apocalypto is unquestionably the most reprehensible , brain-dead and offensive movie i 've seen all year , and this year has been a doozy .
not so much a movie as an unpleasant presence that sits on the screen .
a below-90-minute running time is not even a silver lining to a film that lives up to its name in more ways than one .
. . .could easily be mistaken for the absolute worst that the straight-to-video landscape has to offer . . .
the writers of this movie should be sentenced to a comedy chain gang peeling bananas and making cream pies .
pumpkin struts about with "courage" pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .
a laughable gorefest and a leading contender for the title worst film of the year .
the way the action is shown here , it 's an incoherent mess .
an affluent african-american family is going through some domestic issues: husband loses job , daughter is being ignored , mother has a foot-odour situation - the usual . the answer ? submit to a resurrected carpenter .
what manner of beast might have evolved on earth had a single butterfly been squashed 65 million years ago ? monkeysaurus!
for the most part you stare at the screen and wonder how anybody involved thought this could possibly have been any good .
confused at its core and too befuddled to make that a virtue .
i didn 't laugh at the racist jokes about brown-skinned colombians or gasp at the revelation that a prissy woman is gay , though those tacky moments did at least break the torpor .
this must go down as the single stupidest , big-budget superhero motion picture ever unleashed upon an unsuspecting public by a major hollywood studio .
like many horror fans , i approached viewing the recent remake of the post-slasher classic with extremely low expectations . not low enough , though!
a hate crime against cinema , a ringing indictment of the depths commercialism will go to in search of the lowest common denominator .
it 's deeply immoral to turn a ten year old girl into the bride from "kill bill" and pretend it 's just a cartoon .
why give someone who has a genuine skill for understated , intelligent comedy a highly unfunny script that 's both overly obvious and stupid ?
it 's as if the film is a no-humour zone , and any attempt at a laugh gets sucked into a cinematic vacuum of mirthlessness .
i began giggling with a kind of metaphysical embarrassment for everyone involved in the enterprise , and , eventually , for all of humanity itself .
will make you hate words--and these idiots who refuse to stop saying them without actually saying anything at all .
an irritating 83-minute music montage posing as a feature film , zoom is the worst family release so far this year .
[cohen 's] insights are as worthless as a lecher 's promise and the issues he raises as stale as a couch crumb .
there is no excuse
clokey tries at a comeback and fails . ik .
every element is off-key , and the cumulative effect is staggering -- think showgirls with a demon possession (and elizabeth berkeley 's dancing doesn 't count) .
the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer 's putrid pond of retread action twaddle .
the title is apropos , but it 's also an understatement .
stultifying from start to finish , this mess of a movie is supremely incoherent -- plot- , dialogue- and character-wise .
almost fatally conventional .
the movie sputters along on borrowed gags without improving them .
. . .a complete and utter waste of time .
the only thing separating crossroads from a showtime soft porn is the lack of any actual nudity . like its star , the film is just a highly inappropriate tease .
. . .an unpleasant , distinctly overlong piece of dreck that 's certainly a strong contender for worst movie of the year .
the movie comes dangerously close to saying that the solution to a personal grievance is , well , terrorism , when you get right down to it .
saw ii is not for the faint of heart . it 's for the foolish of wallet .
gods of egypt is the most epic sun-and-sand disaster since elizabeth taylor almost broke 20th century-fox with her 1963 film cleopatra .
let me be blunt: in three days of thinking , i cannot remember a movie worse than striptease .
a major bore .
"fun size" presents the broiling hormones of youth at room temperature .
the score by marco beltrami might suggest a mission impossible , but the movie 's reality is more like a poor man 's wile e . coyote-road runner cartoon . . .
it feels like sheldon wilson tossed a bunch of third-hand scares in a blender and set it to puree , resulting in a gray , flavorless sludge .
people being pranked by some supernatural agency for about 75 minutes . for the last 10 minutes , said agency gets down to doing more than ringing the doorbell and running .
sounds interesting enough , right ? what could go wrong ? well , everything .
one of the hardest times i 've had getting through a film . it 's horrible .
you could show it to terrorists to incite their hatred of america , that 's how stupidly misguided it is .
so predictable , cheap and clichd , you might think it was made by disney .
utterly devoid of merit , fantastic or otherwise , a more exasperating descent into the feline world is difficult to imagine .
the reader is a cloaked male fantasy , in which a milf hides under spinster garb -- all for a 16-year-old 's delight .
the dirty talk is so painfully forced and emphatic it lacks any comic spontaneity .
a mash-up of vampire horror and period westerns stewed with blade runner cityscapes and ridiculous religious images in a bubbling cauldron of dumb ideas and sinfully bad dialogue .
. . .just another paint-by-numbers exercise in absolutely tedium .
it needs to be emphasized that eating out 3 has nothing to do with the restaurant business , lest any foodies wander into this ineptly written and acted gay sex comedy by accident .
this is a dirty piece of work , and everyone it touches -- especially audiences -- deserved better .
the exterminator is a sick example of the almost unbelievable descent into gruesome savagery in american movies .
you want real terror ? if this second outing proves profitable , we 'll be looking at yet again i recall the summer before the summer before last . now that 's scary .
[the ending] shamelessly exploits a real-life event , an iconic moment whose heartbreak far eclipses anything this cheap melodrama contrives .
a camped up ripoff of the raiders of the lost ark and romancing the stone movies .
quarts of shiny blood are splashed around and numerous moans and groans pepper the soundtrack , but astonishingly , the movie never manages to provoke so much as a shudder .
if this was directed by a white guy it would be deemed racist , and rightly so .
star-spangled silliness , and one of the biggest debacles of the 1980s
hard time in the joint can change a person . make them worse sometimes . and it would appear that this is hilton 's idea of revenge on a world she feels has done her wrong .
despite a talented voice cast , the film can 't escape its baseline mediocrity . it 's little more than an 86-minute branding exercise .
lock them all up and throw away the key is what i say .
boring , boring , boring kids movie with sea animals . free willy this is not .
one of the worst films i 've ever seen .
the whole film is a nonstop parade of dick jokes , rape jokes , and will ferrell making the same goofy faces he first introduced on snl ages ago .
a franchise sinks in this sequel 's endless sea of incompetence .
almost everything said by melanie sounds childish and outrageous . it makes the host extremely immature .
you gotta be kidding me .
i would say that chaos ensues , but it started the minute the opening credits started to roll , so 'ensuing ' is not very helpful . chaos reigns .
irritating and painful .
let me float the suggestion that it be rated pg-13-only , since anyone older than that will quickly realize he or she has better things to do than attend this pitiful beverly hills cop retread .
the movie makes you crave a streamlined story , interesting characters and a joystick .
mad money opens with the sight of an enormous pile of hundred dollar bills , and that 's roughly what it would take to make me once again sit through this dim-witted caper .
when characters are this stupid in a story , it 's either a comedy or an insult , for asking viewers to be just as stupid in response .
a deeply lazy and sentimental raunch comedy from director judd apatow and writer-star amy schumer . basically , a marshmallow covered with bodily fluids .
. . .one can 't help but marvel at the decision to release this turd theatrically .
remarkably inept .
not funny . it 's not even dumb funny .
as long as we 're trying michael jackson in a court of law , why can 't we thrown in todd solondz as a co-defendent ?
this is something special , even among its ilk . frighteningly bad .
pretentious , preposterous and painfully bad , the fountain is by far the worst film in an atrocious year . . . . my wife thinks it 's the worst movie that she has ever seen .
there 's little to recommend this b-grade , formulaic affair . the plot is tosh , the dialogue hackneyed at best .
compadres feels less like an actual movie and more like a half-dozen movies thrown together , and absolutely nothing sticks .
you always have to be careful with the initial releases of any calendar year .
the script sometimes seems to have been written by a 13-year-old .
fantastic four is quite possibly the least action-filled action movie in marvel history .
there 's a lot of sexual violence in the film , but it scans as unimaginatively repulsive , as well as blatantly misogynistic .
sordid and ludicrous , it 's a steamy stink-bomb!
a downright miserable experience .
this latest version isn 't likely to reinvigorate an interest in burnett 's previous adaptations or her prose with what amounts to a pileup of tedious approximations and clichés of her characters and themes .
an incoherent film that 's kind of a chore to sit through .
the script is stodgy , the effects absurd . saddled with shootouts , explosions , and stormy devastation , the film does little more than place cartoonish stereotypes in perilous situations .
everything you need to know about the atrocious australian crime thriller "kill me times" can be summed up in a guitar riff .
little man is so childish and absurd that there should probably be a law against seeing it . the penalty: seeing it again .
a work of unintelligent design .
a string of shameless sales pitches sans the rudiments of a major motion picture . next time , how about including an ending if you 're going to ask us to sit through two hours of commercials ?
caters almost exclusively to the remedial , duplo blocks demographic , leaving parents and guardians bored to distraction .
mega swindle vs giant rip-off
stupefyingly inane . . .
oh i 'm sorry , i don 't understand what any of this is for , it must be art . pardon the hell out of me .
the first film of 2016 should have been shot before it exited the paddock . not only would it have been merciful , it would have saved me from 90 minutes of sheer tedium .
how far down the hollywood food chain do you have to go before you get stuck with jamie kennedy as the star of your movie ? did ben affleck turn down son of the mask ?
this film manages the extraordinary , almost mythological feat of surpassing all that came before it to stand proud as the worst of all ten friday the 13th movies .
would be more aptly named sh*te world than spice world .
a mind-numbing monster movie .
feebly crafted in virtually every way imaginable -- directing , cinematography , acting , scriptwriting .
the good news is that i only need 9 more movies for my 10 worst list .
as time capsules of our defeated , misanthropic age go , hostage is pretty good . as cash grabs go , it 's pretty despicable .
hubris , ignorance and pathetic ineptitude collide here in an explosion of cretinism that makes jackass 3-d look like the height of intellectualism .
like watching the pamela anderson and tommy lee sex tape . . . without the sex
it all has the feel of a pretentious film student desperately trying to make a statement with his thesis film . it 's extremely overwrought with laughable melodrama .
though it doesn 't say so anywhere in the film , road house must be set on another planet where the inhabitants resemble humans . this can 't be the world i live in .
"self/less" ultimately earns its title , but it could just as easily have been called "brain/less ," "pulse/less" and "point/less ."
a minor exploitation flick gussied up as an important piece of commentary on sexual politics .
rome burns when stuff like this makes it into the collective unconscious .
is it too soon to pronounce something 'the worst film of the year ? '
a bizarre mix of explosions , histrionic acting and ridiculous plotting . . . and it isn 't pretty .
[mann 's] closeup work on the characters themselves is shaky , perhaps in the hope that we won 't notice they 're made of cardboard .
one of the last lines by al pacino in the film is , "burn this ." i agree .
the latest nicholas sparks adaptation may turn off even his most ardent fans .
thoroughly inept in just about every aspect .
kind of hoosiers: part 2 . but the storytelling is so backassward that it 's impossible to care about any of the characters or really engage in the movie whatsoever .
a broadly promising premise and well-matched stars prove no match for an abominably unfunny screenplay and the work of the poisonously untalented shawn levy .
shutter is a ghost story free of logic and spirit , representative of everything that 's wrong with so much of current mainstream studio fare .
it insulted my intelligence , yes , but i still have some hope for the human race after watching it .
it 's rare to see a movie fail in every possible area . . .
hated it so much so very very much
you know you 're in trouble when baseballer-turned-ratfink jose canseco isn 't the sleaziest thing in your movie .
garry marshall , how could you ? you have made a mockery of a movie that bears the name of my birthday . i take this as a personal affront .
contrived to the point of painful .
croft 's quest is to find pandora 's box before a mad scientist can get there first , open it , and unleash a series of second-rate special effects upon an unsuspecting world .
someone ought to pay for this .
loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
a curiously dull americanization of one of the finest examples of subtle , moody j-horror out there .
. . .which is my way of saying , if you see it , you 're exactly the type of person who would .
there 's nothing to make your hair stand on end in the shed because it 's not convincing .
burt reynolds hits new lows as he mugs his way through this film .
a gross , stupid and relentlessly ugly film from start to finish .
in between scenes of the muscleheads torturing their victim , bay indulges his taste for treating women as sluts and grisly brutality as a nifty excuse for a cheap laugh .
kidnap isn 't schlock , it 's garbage .
replicas is unequivocally a terrible film , filled with terrible writing and terrible performances .
a spectacularly scattershot , pandering mess of pulp junk , cheap-looking animation , and poisonous gender dynamics . a charmless cash-grab that can 't be bothered with the slightest stab at originality .
is this fan service ? if so , for whom ? hannibal lecter ? charles manson ?
if you go , one piece of advice: byobb . bring your own barf bag .
this is not merely one of the worst films in recent memory but it could well go down as one of the worst things ever conceived by human hands .
lords of dogtown is nothing more than a steaming pile of dog crap .
it 's offensive , yes; but it doesn 't offend me as a humorist , it offends me as an individual with an i .q . in the triple digits .
it 's slow , unfunny , unexciting , and somewhat unfamiliar , as if created by people who aren 't fans of the show and who have no idea what fans wish to see .
any incremental gains civilization may have made have been wiped out , obliterated without a trace by the fact of this film 's existence . it 's an affront . an atrocity .
the whole thing is perverse , with first-time (and hopefully last time) screenwriter jeffrey hammond and director chris sivertson taking particular delight in the way the killer toys with his victims .
this is no mere entertainment . it 's an instructional video .
i was too bored to be properly angry , and too disgusted to be properly lulled to sleep . robert has betrayed us all .
even if the whole vampires vs . werewolves thing hadn 't already been done to un-death by true blood and the twilight and underworld franchises , dylan dog would still be a crushingly dull 107 minutes .
a depressing , stereotypical affair that can be thanked by the african american community for portraying their race as lazy , drug-addicted , and whorish .
racist , stupid and boasting cheesy effects that wouldn 't pass muster on basic cable .
this is girl power ? i 'll not have what she 's having , thank you very much , and i 'm thinking about amassing a small army of my own to demand as much .
an all around awful experience .
honestly , i don 't know what to say about this movie , because it feels so phenomenally old-fashioned and outdated , so ridiculously conservative and undermining of female independence .
i 'd like to condemn this piece of trash to a celluloid landfill .
pandering to the point of offensive .
g .i . joe: retaliation is like zero dark thirty written by 1st graders (and not the ones in the gifted class) .
if this had been in greek and swahili without subtitles it couldn 't have been more incomprehensible . you will rarely spend 80 more excruciating minutes .
crass and obnoxious , "the virginity hit" is an atrocious and unfunny comedy .
what a disaster .
gossip is a remarkably accurate title for a glossy , shallow thriller where not a single scene rings true .
a waste of time!
ineptly written , feebly acted , clumsily directed yawner of an adventure yarn .
through it all , willis looks like he 's late to cash his check .
there may have been more ludicrous , preposterous movies sci-fi movies this summer . i just don 't remember one . pitiful and lame - it 's a step backward .
the story isn 't the bad part of the last airbender - in fact , it 's the best part . . . the bad part is almost everything else .
if you 've seen the first minute , you 've seen it all .
one of the worst filmed musicals i 've ever seen , and that includes cop rock
does stewart emerge unsullied ? very nearly . i give him credit for that . right up until almost the very end of the film , he retains a certain poise and dignity .
between its garish digital photography and borderline incomprehensible narrative , i know who killed me at times suggests a hack 's attempt at a lynch film .
the picture shows what happens when a writer (tarantino) and a director (rodriguez) come together and reinforce each other 's worst tendencies and misconceptions .
abysmal and an embarrassment for everyone concerned
not only does this film hate its very subject matter , it 's also the most hideous example of product placement in cinematic history .
"hey , remember 20 minutes ago when we were at k-mart and all that stuff we saw and did there ?"
miller turns every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip , complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears .
offers such a 13-year-old boy 's perspective on love and sex that you wouldn 't even trust it to unhook a bra .
any production featuring jack black in spandex and showing off his belly full of stretch marks should never have made it off the drawing board in the first place .
something tells me john agar would be looking down with pride at darkness falls .
to question where things went wrong feels somehow strange , as the project seems to have been ill-conceived from the very start .
[a] highly preposterous kitchen sink film which seems made up as it goes along .
perhaps hoping to be a sort of hybrid matrix meets indiana jones meets alien , unfortunately , alone in the dark is just a bad movie .
at this point , there are inflatable toys that are livelier than stone , but how can you tell the difference ? basic instinct 2 is not an erotic thriller . it 's taxidermy .
it 's a sloppy movie , an ostensible horror film lacking in scares and weighed down by half-realized mythology and numerous repetitive stretches .
every aspect of the film is slipshod and second-hand .
mortdecai is the stuff that inspires stipulations in wills , as in , 'have some basic decency on the event of my passing , and don 't let people bring up that one movie . '
wall-e and finding nemo director andrew stanton must shoulder the blame for this over-bloated disaster . it 's impossible to care about the protagonists , played by the helplessly wooden kitsch and collins .
two people walked out of the screening in the first half hour and the man sitting next to me slept through it . when it doesn 't work , it doesn 't work .
dismal . . . there 's more preachiness here than in a hundred 'abc afterschool specials , ' and the special effects wouldn 't pass muster on a local kiddie show .
just really , really lame , right down to the communist symbols that adorn the revised stars and stripes .
. . .a tawdry piece of sensationalized , stylistic junk , with barely an iota of accuracy . . .
rob reiner 's films have always aimed for a heartwarming effect and more frequently resulted in heartworm .
a terrible waste of a cast , script , and my time .
simply put , this is horrible .
a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless .
the scary part is that a sequel was made .
i think the men were cast more for their abs than their acting .
a watered-down version of prior , better films , 'the haunting of molly hartley ' is as dumb as a box of halloween candy .
this grim holiday-themed comedy is the movie equivalent of getting socks and underwear for christmas .
more so , next time you promise me 100 minutes of nonstop extreme thrills , could you actually provide some ?
a wasted opportunity .
rotten to the core and misogynistic in the extreme .
the premise is a whopper of a bad idea , made all the more disheartening by the notion that someone thought highly enough of it to see it as a feasible outlet for movie comedy .
broad stereotypes engaged in shallow versions of complex issues .
a truly repellent piece of work . . .
two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
the most infuriating movie i 've seen this year , and i saw marmaduke .
forget the mess 88 minutes as it only takes five minutes for viewers to recognize a loser .
the film has a freak-show quality .
"rock the kasbah" is an extremely stilted piece of work that suffocates the talents of its actors .
. . .a seriously oppressive and downright unwatchable piece of work .
mean , crass and tasteless , "my best friend 's girl" is only pretending to be a romantic comedy .
a painfully bad film . . . this ridiculous art-house nonsense is supposed to be a comedy , but i never laughed nor did i ever even come close to smiling .
promise me you won 't go there .
dispiriting , enervating stuff .
forgettable .
every so often a movie comes along that 's so lame , you can almost make out a "what the hell am i doing here ?" thought bubble over an actor 's head .
what were they thinking ?
vulgar , tasteless , mean-spirited and most offensive of all--not funny .
i felt like i needed to take a shower before i went back inside my house .
if you are looking for a breath of fresh eire , you are in the wrong movie .
how do i start in describing this disaster of a movie ?
rest assured - you 'll be anything but merry when you leave this one; the only thing this robin hood steals is two hours of your life that you 'll never get back .
thou shalt avoid it like the plague - at least until the dvd is released .
it 's all directed - and played - at fever pitch with an egregious disregard for real-world comportment .
this movie is a waste of talent , effort and most of all time , and why anyone with half a brain would willingly choose to subject themselves to viewing it is light years beyond me .
'winter 's tale ' makes 'safe haven ' look like 'the godfather . '
battlefield earth bathes in a pool of utter ridiculousness and cheesy visual styles , then stands up expecting everyone to admire it
if you 've always wanted to see robert de niro forced to thread a steel rod through an open wound and then strung upside down by john travolta , this is the movie for you .
the original wasn 't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece!
it 's tough to know how to begin addressing this swill of a so-called comedy .
straining to capture artistic frenzy , it descends into vulgar chaos , less a homage to federico fellini 1/2s 8 1/2 (its putative inspiration) than a travesty .
this one represents rob zombie 's "vision ." that being the case , he 's blind .
the only real crime that needs solving is how ride along 2 managed to escape production prison and was allowed to assault our senses and insult our intelligence .
greedily tries to cram every dystopian curse into one misbegotten plot , resulting in something wildly disjointed , even if its pieces arguably connect .
a morbid , misguided mess with a fractured narrative , guaranteed to drive audiences away in droves .
a lazily written and neglectfully directed mess that is clearly nothing more than fulfilment of the need to round out a trilogy . totally uncalled for . a waste .
house of 1000 corpses rips off so many splatter movie tricks at once that it becomes totally frustrating .
i have seen many execrable films -- plan 9 from outer space , disaster movie , batman & robin -- but never has a movie made me so physically ill .
woody allen 's clumsy , unfunny , preachy homage to secular humanism commits the cardinal sin; it 's devoid of humor .
a class-five pity party so unbearably condescending and unconvincing that it might just make you run out and buy an "i 'm with mitt" t-shirt , it makes an inadvertent but hugely compelling pro-bullying argument .
even by the low standards of this type of live-action , family friendly comedy , show dogs is especially lame .
by the time elton john sings , 'soon as this is over , we 'll go home , ' moviegoers will be way ahead of him .
[an] absolutely bewildering waste of time , talent , energy and money .
for a film that thinks it 's being uplifting and inspiring , 'collateral beauty ' is arguably the most offensive and insipid major hollywood film this year .
fools rush in to watch this stupid romantic comedy .
i like that they use crows , because the stink of this carrion has flushed out a few guilty jackdaws .
an exploitative thriller that also harbors dangerous notions about and readily trivializes child neglect , sexual abuse and rape .
a dead-in-the-soul cash grab of a movie set in the competitive world of b-boy dancing that thinks clichs , phony melodrama and product placement can substitute for real storytelling and actual characters .
. . .the movie 's not even bright enough to at least see the potential of a sense of humor amidst all its meandering .
one of the very worst films of 1989 .
what have i learned ? high school movies can be duller—and more sour—than previously thought possible . . .the least generic element of general education is its openly hostile attitude toward gay people . [blu-ray]
i find nothing entertaining about kids screaming for two hours .
i want my ninety minutes back .
can you say 'cinematic atrocity ' boys and girls ? i was afraid you could . this has a place in the sequel-for-sequel 's-sake hall of infamy .
arrives on dvd a day late and a dollar short
someday , the bounty hunter and last month 's cop out will be featured in a cable movie double bill as the two worst 1988 films of 2010 .
jean claude van damme 's recent string of films haven 't been too inspiring , and knock off doesn 't do anything to change the trend .
there 's something positively mind-numbing about the relentless predictability of sweet home alabama .
when a movie has been sitting around since 2003 , why wouldn 't you just throw it at the dvd shelf rather than subjecting big-screen audiences to it ?
is "meh" the sound the world will make when it finally sputters out ? it doesn 't matter because we are clearly #sooverit .
bland , corny , sophomoric , unimaginative and painfully contrived with two leads who have no charisma or chemistry together . [it 's] a great cure for insomnia .
your first clue that you 're about to see the worst flick of 2010 is the two nicholas cage trailers you endure before the movie even starts .
it 's pitched at a pre-teen audience -- the only kind likely to enjoy levant 's cheap misfire .
what we end up with is a bunch of truly unpleasant , self-absorbed teenagers yelling at each other on skype -- all recorded in grating lo-fi to maximize the headache-inducing annoyance value .
47 meters down is a floundering misfire .
well over $20 million was spent to create a film full of sound and fury but without an inkling of intelligence .
a diabolically psychotic , sub-mental and completely unwatchable disaster . . .
the irony in this movie about vampires is that the only thing doing any sucking is the movie itself .
not only offers no insight on relationships but seems completely unfamiliar with normal human behavior .
utterly impossible and hapless .
not to put too fine a point on it , but "bulletproof monk" is a rather large piece of garbage .
like the dead kitty left to rot under grandma 's couch , this movie stinks!
the idea of snuff films is presented as so obnoxious that it disgusts even the slimiest porn peddlers .
a revoltingly bad stinker that is easily in the running for the worst film of the decade .
diablo is the first new film i 've seen in 2016 . i 'll be surprised if i see one that 's worse all year .
tom hardy is a terrific actor . however , capone is easily the worst performance of his career . this movie is so bad . . .
if ever a movie was made for a quick in-and-out engagement at the multiplex , this is it .
the first reveal of nicolas cage sporting a blond wig with ringlets that makes him look like a shirley temple drag queen impersonator after a post-medieval-party-themed blackout is the sort of fright probably not intended by its makers .
the film looks like it was made for $1 .05 with its murky cinematography , sloppy special effects , and cheap sets .
it isn 't merely bad , it makes you want to clamp your hands to either side of your face and do an impersonation of the scream .
"richard jewell" is a competent piece of filmmaking , but it 's also an irresponsible and thinly veiled propaganda piece , and i 'm not the least bit cool with that in 2019 .
for losers
as i write this . . .i have just walked out on christmas with the kranks after roughly 45 minutes of mind-numbingly humorless , sitcom barrel-bottom idiocy .
survivors is a truly awful mix of bad direction , nonsensical story line and dialogue that appears to have been made up on the spot .
there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn 't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls .
the 'fifth kind ' is when you 're stupid enough to spend your hard earned cash to view what is easily one of 2009 's worst films and a surefire razzie nominee for worst picture .
an ending so unlikely in that forlorn uplift way that an insulin shot should be offered as part of the dvd 's packaging .
her sword is red , her eyes are blue and her movie is horrible .
it was a time when fake boobs would get you backstage , but phoniness like rock of ages deserves to be tossed out the back door on its ass .
the film may sound like an instant camp classic , but while it 's staggeringly odd , it isn 't much fun .
the film was clearly conceived and written by men who have no interest in approaching female friendships with any degree of complexity , curiosity , or respect .
julien donkey-boy really is an excuse to let korine go nuts with his jerky video camera as he stitches together a series of completely unrelated and utterly vapid sequences .
scummy sleaze doesn 't get more amoral and savage than this petulant , loathsome tale . you can feel the hate .
if you can appreciate bad cinema , than i recommend it , but anyone that is looking to watch an actual good movie , avoid like the plague!
it feeds the warrior fantasies of adolescent boys with a testosterone-heavy tale of a war free of moral complications .
. . .substituting crudity and shock value for intelligence and wit , this seems to encourage impressionable youth to engage in deplorable behavior .
peaks with its animated opening credits .
um , lack of multi-dimensional flying body parts wasn 't this series ' problem .
thus myers marries his two passions (hockey and not being funny) into one noxious ball .
. . .a torturous , boring , nonsensical monotony .
a sexed-up afterschool special pretty much guaranteed to render audiences comatose .
this new year 's eve leaves you feeling like you 've got no one to kiss at midnight .
prophecy fails so miserably that it reaches depths generally reserved for william shatner records and nora ephron screenplays . watch it with a friend .
after watching this film , the only emotion i 'm left with is confusion .
. . .might as well have been sponsored by nascar 's "drive for diversity" program .
the dukes of hazzard is just plain awful .
the one good thing about it is that it 's over in one hour and 47 minutes . the bad thing is to think what a terrible waste it was of an hour and 47 minutes .
next time mike hodges wants to make a movie , i would suggest he shoot it in total darkness and drop the dialogue .
i cannot help but think that maybe [travolta 's] laughing that he was able to sucker people into pouring millions of dollars toward making such an unspeakable waste .
here 's an idea: get adam shankman to do the next one , from a script by akiva goldsman--let 's see bond wriggle out of that one .
a smug , arch , irritating thing that hates its audience , hates genre films , and , curiously , hates itself most of all .
[rec] 4: apocalypse . . . raise your hand to be among one of the worst movies of the year , at least . [full review in spanish]
putrid , offensive and life-sucking . early word is describing this woebegone fiasco as the next batman and robin . having seen both , joel schumacher has every right to protest the comparison .
as portrayed by zachary gordon , greg lacks . . . charm and spontaneity . . . no real sparks of mischievousness or bone-deep embarrassment or endearing flush of affection light this kid up .
there are bad movies , and then there are nancy meyers movies .
a humor-free comedy
hugely tedious and mostly incomprehensible , quentin tarantino-wannabe dutch director felix van groeningen 's steve + sky is the kind of foreign movie that gives subtitles a bad name .
the befuddled seal may not understand why they hate us , but the attitudes perpetuated by act of valor might begin to provide a clue .
"the counselor" is a disaster on nearly every level , but it all starts with mccarthy 's muddled , mean-spirited screenplay .
the script is not funny or even humorous , or logical , or satirical . . .the sepia type color makes it unpleasant to watch .
few films exploit the merchandising angle as cynically as spy kids 3-d: game over .
this movie is mediocrity incarnate . watching it i felt brain cells leaping to their deaths like so many lemmings .
needless to say , as a cringe-worthy and excruciatingly awful comedy , you shouldn 't pay a dime of king 's ransom .
seagal may be a success , but i 'm just grateful he only makes one movie a year .
some folks reach for nirvana , but the wayans brothers -- writer/director keenen ivory , writer/star marlon , and writer/star shawn -- aim for the nadir , and man oh man , have they reached it .
goodness knows we could all use some more butternut squash , especially during the holidays .
. . .epitomizes the vapidity of the american film-making industry .
the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves .
if your little ones are clamoring for this then make them wait for cable .
[a] crass , cheap , hack-job cash-grab .
movies keep getting worse . hall pass was awful . drive angry made hall pass seem like gone with the wind . take me home tonight makes one yearn for drive angry .
serving sara is such a miserable excuse for a movie that the constant ringing of a cellphone at its preview screening served only to improve it .
bargain-basement evangelical stuff . notice the devout muslim passenger gets "left behind" . belongs in a church basement , not a movie theater .
the film has about as much freshness as cheap chewing gum .
. . .an inept , flat-out worthless piece of work . . .
the movie 's best performance is given by a camel .
for the cast , shooting the movie (in ukraine) may have been a working vacation , but for viewers , watching it is an excruciating sentence of hard labor .
a total bomb; an insult to the original serials; not even good camp .
. . . how poor is the picture 's writing and how ill-equipped is gyllenhaal at being british , persian , an action hero , or having a pulse .
with unsympathetic characters and a preposterous plot , the film has only the outdoor action scenes to provide a slight diversion from total boredom .
so bad , i was hoping everyone would die in the end , so i wouldn 't have to sit through a sequel .
baldwin is shockingly uninteresting , walking through this role . . . or should i say sweating , for dave is covered in perspiration in practically every scene .
core and wimmer don 't just make a bad movie , they make one so terrible it 's flabbergasting just how ghastly it actually is .
ugh .
"acrimony" is a study in frustrating episodic storytelling and the revolving stages of one 's reaction to where it very slowly goes . ultimately , by the end credits , the only acrimony left is from the bamboozled viewer .
there aren 't very many alternatives right at this moment , so expect it to make money out of proportion with its quality .
it 's hard to find anything to like in little black book , especially murphy , who is the most revolting lead actress in hollywood .
it 's the cinematic equivalent of a selfie .
an exhaustive sensory assault held together by sugarless gum . let it be known: transformers: the last straw is this summer 's independence day: resurgence .
a bland , timid and thoroughly un-thrilling teen thriller .
. . .belying its title , what 's true is that very little in this film is true (but) its greatest fault as an entertainment is that it is unremittingly boring and uninvolving .
a big , loud , boring wreck .
looks like robin williams has replaced cuba gooding , jr . as the kiss of death on the set of any comedy .
hilariously terrible in any season .
one of the very worst films of 1989 .
the series ' nadir . . .nothing but a delivery system for murder and half-glimpses of naked women .
in the long , ignoble tradition of naff romcoms starring butler , this stands alongside the ugly truth and the bounty hunter as the worst of its kind .
a rom-com for dudes that seeks to outdo the ladies by being even more insipid , formulaic and contrived than anything katherine heigl has ever done .
this is even less inspired and imaginative than the friday the 13th reboot and makes rob zombie 's halloween films feel like the work of an auteur .
falls somewhere between horrible and laughably awful .
innocuous , self-centered and disconnected from any parcel of meaningful human experience .
'beware the film of mary shaw 's; it had no scares , only flaws . '
paul schrader and brett easton ellis don 't have the sense of play this kind of narrative of one-upmanship requires , as we 're never allowed to enjoy the characters ' misdeeds .
[a] bloated , misshapen mess , a stillborn franchise loaded with metaphors for its feeble attempts to amuse , excite and entertain .
at times it displays an almost alarming level of contempt for its audience .
well , it was bound to happen: the wayans brothers have made a movie that 's even more two-dimensional than a cartoon .
unfortunately , not a good picture .
why do you suppose "saturday night live" stars seem to be no more discriminating when picking movie scripts than zoo monkeys are when they eat their own feces ?
i 'm being deadly serious here--i 'll take scooby 's team-up with jerry reed , sonny and cher and phyllis diller before this one .
if the adam shankman film 's debasement of its subject into campy kitsch is the unavoidable fate of all culturally dangerous art , that doesn 't make it any less palatable .
a movie where paris hilton is a bombshell is less comedy and more science fiction . . .
transformers: the last knight is the pinnacle of summer blockbuster stupidity . the only thing that could top it is another transformers sequel , a nightmare to imagine .
the sequel takes everything that was good about the first film - a raunchy , though affectionate , take on how guys look back on the moment when their lives went south - and makes it seem accidental .
john swanbeck has made a notable debut with the big kahuna .
the ad campaign for saw v assures the viewer , 'you won 't believe how it ends . ' this is true , because you won 't believe it could possibly be this lame .
sometimes i wonder what really goes on in the offices of studio executives .
a diabolical romcom in which the hero is a sexist plastic surgeon who preys on younger women and enjoys hitting small children . have you guessed yet that he 's played by adam sandler ?
the year is 2013 . there is no order . there is no peace . return to sender . audience unknown .
snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
even for a michael bay movie , this robot-on-robot sequel is a pointless , messy assault on the senses . the special effects , of course , are flawless . the rest is scrap metal .
a lot of noisy tomfoolery that never coalesces into a solid horror yarn , lacking even the beloved pea soup 'n ' rotating noggins that made us quake way back when .
. . .an aggressively pretentious art-house disaster generally devoid of redeeming qualities .
the movie doesn 't end so much as stop , while promising at least one sequel . but here 's a wild guess: this is the last you 'll be hearing about "the darkest minds ."
my advice is to beat your children rather than take them to daddy day care .
this sequel is obnoxious , unfunny , and disgusting , a far cry from the humorous original .
dude , like the only purpose of this film is to like coarsen society , use gutter language , and appeal to the lowest intellect possible . that 's like awesome , dude .
. . .interminable . . .
the balladeer always sang that the mountain might get the duke boys someday . with this movie , they crash the general lee into it and explode .
with the appearance in movie theaters of daredevil , we have now officially arrived at the bottom of the comic-book pile .
although tim burton had nothing to do with it , this is certainly a nightmare before christmas .
rather than capture truly pained souls tangled in exuberant horror tropes , the filmmakers settle for retrograde anguish and warmed-over artistry .
it 's nothing sex in a movie about nothing people doing nothing in the middle of nowhere for no reason . i think that 's the effect dumont was going for .
exists in a place beyond criticism . it hasn 't got a plot to speak of , or characters; like the recent rollerball remake , it in many ways verges on the experimental .
eventually , the oh 's becomes 'zzzzzz 's . '
don 't even bother renting the eventual video .
these clowns couldn 't get jobs as dogcatchers , let alone fbi agents .
this is a movie without wit , style or reason , and the true horror is that actors were made to portray , and technicians to realize , its bankruptcy of imagination .
. . . the 80-minute setup for the shock has nothing to do with engaging the deep-seated fears and emotions that really plague us all , at some level , every day .
kirkpatrick keeps stomping on the drama pedal while blowing the clich horn , yielding scene after tired scene of predictable developments as the principals keep shoving guns into mouths and screaming obscenities .
your suspension of disbelief will totally diminish when the abominable snowmen/yetis show up and start cheering each other on and practically giving each other high fives after beating up the bad guys!
a toothless , fright-free journey into dullsville .
van helsing itself is an unholy mix of exhumed ideas from a generation of monster movies . unlike the monster , though , it never comes to life .
. . .even if soaked in bleach 's message landed on sympathetic ears , the film makes curious decisions that distract from their central thesis .
the prime example of what happens when you craft something for the express purpose of entertaining dullards , mental defectives , and toddlers .
straight-to-download is the deserved fate . don 't hold it back by buying a ticket .
all eyez on me is one of the most useless music biopics ever made-it 'll be too confusing for newcomers and too underwhelming for those familiar with the work and the life of rap prophet tupac shakur .
it 's absolutely dreadful , but will appeal to the prejudices of anyone who found terrence malick 's the tree of life a timeless masterpiece or david gordon green 's bore-athon george washington life-affirming .
i 've been more frightened by the prospect of folding my own laundry than by anything the mangler offers up .
plays like an amateur debut effort written over a weekend during which its writer wasn 't entirely sober .
demonstrates that few are immune to the corrosive effect that technology can have on story , character , and sense .
there 's precious little to listen to , laugh at or ogle .
a romantic dramedy that stumbles through its excruciatingly oscar-padded 126-minute running time with no end in sight .
a disgusting , cinematic descent into depravity destined to leave its victims , sitting slack-jawed and speechless in stunned disbelief .
it 's like an amalgam of ghostbusters , alien and the pokemon movies -- - all the good parts .
it 's only january , but dirty grandpa is so desperately unfunny and excruciatingly endless at 102 minutes that it 's dead certain for a top spot on lists of the year 's worst movies .
quite possibly the worst film of the year . . .a real stinker .
raises the question once again of why , in our society , movies are the only arena in which "it 's for children" means that the product is demonstrably worse .
an animated kiddie comedy that delivers all the wonder you 'd expect in a movie about a guy delivering one package .
a jaw-dropping intergalactic caper 'comedy ' where no less than the fate of the entire universe is at stake .
you 'd have to be more than merely intoxicated to find anything about this dismal stoner comedy remotely funny . you 'd have to be unconscious .
bad santa 2 is up there with the worst films i 've seen in recent years .
the filmmakers are so at a loss for fresh ways to shock that they even dredge up the twitchy , girl-with-hair-hanging-in-her-face trick from the ring and the grudge .
a movie about wormholes made from a script riddled with more holes than hillary clinton 's campaign strategy .
as an actor , franco effectively appropriated the tics of the one-man-orchestra wiseau , but the comedy ends on the side of condescension and the punishment of others . [full review in spanish]
one of the most embarrassingly unfunny comedies to crawl down the pike in some time .
if you took this script to any sane film producer , they would assume you were pulling a prank . when you told them the shockingly untalented nick swardson was attached as the lead , they 'd call security .
being punched in the face was easier that watching this movie .
the film presents its scattershot cop-movie tropes in earnest , as if , like hurricanes , they were natural , unavoidable phenomena .
while the marine 's real-world connections to the war in iraq are brief and incidental to its minimal plot , that fact doesn 't make its reductive attitudes any more pleasant to swallow .
both the farrellys and stiller seem to have run their course; the film is flabby and the jokes are tired , and all that 's left is easy potshots at the usual targets .
you 're better off picking up a controller and directing your own story .
director wych kaosayananda -- or kaos , to you -- is stupendously inept , unable even to properly light a combat sequence .

ghastly , but only in the sense of ineptitude .
there 's something sad about lee purposely sculpting her breasts to resemble basketballs , then parading around topless or nearly topless for most of the film , while her character is supposed to comically strike a blow for feminism .

it has to be one of the flattest , unfunny comedies that i 've seen in a very long time . honestly , the best i could manage was a weak smile here or there .
after this , after "movin ' out" (based on the deplorable songbook of one willliam joel) , it 's not even satire to suggest that the next big thing will be a musical inspired by the oeuvre of howard jones

freddy got fingered makes dude , where 's my car ? look like an oscar contender .

surely the rocker , an incredible admirer of horror films , realized his final product wasn 't above the standards of the kind of straight-to-video shlock that even elvira or sybil danning would be ashamed to present .

norbit sets a new standard for the worst hollywood can conceivably produce .
hate . . .hate!!!
the story not only relies on the complete and unalterable stupidity of every character in the movie , but on the gullibility of those who watch it .
easily one of the worst films in years .
really , is there supposed to be any entertainment value in this thing , or is it meant to be a ponderously stupid endurance test ?

this is the stuff of good , clean , campy fun . but instead of titillating , the in crowd is nothing but a deadly dull business .
a puerile comedy so appalling and unfunny , it 's like contracting the norwalk virus at sea . twice .
a chaotic kung fu , sci-fi , rama-lama-dingdong on themes handled more originally by the matrix .
nothing more than a loud , horrible cinematic experience that will leave horror fans demanding kahn 's head on a pike once the film gets released .
no yacht was harmed during shooting . it 's the movie that 's the shipwreck .
how best to explain a film this mean-spirited , this unfunny--this dispiriting ?

bateman 's formidable comic instincts really fail him here .

abusive sentimentality . [full review in spanish]
transformers is supposedly about robots who turn into cars and back again; what it 's really about is big hollywood turning money into stupid and back again
feels like the longest movie ever made .
absolutely dreadful -- boring , boring , boring .
there can be no excuse .
all things considered , a more appropriate title would have been oil and water .
i hope that one day a filmmaker does right by the victims of colonia dignidad because colonia is exploitative garbage .
the story exists mainly to provide reason and shape for the frenzy of carnage: constant , numbing , and in the film 's view at least , occasionally funny .
i 'll believe that kevin federline is a renaissance man , mel gibson loves matzoh and george pataki is going to be our next president before i 'll believe the premise of this movie .
to use the obvious metaphor and equate 'envy ' to what jack black 's miracle product is designed to clean up would be an insult to the canine digestive system .
this is baron cohen 's worst film , period .
georgia rule is a bad idea dreadfully executed -- on golden pond with fellatio jokes and whimsical incest melodrama and fonda playing her dad (who , more and more , she eerily resembles) .
parents should take their children to "hoodwinked too! hood vs . evil ," if only because kids are never too young to learn the important and liberating skill of walking out of a movie and demanding a refund .
incarnate is such a pointless bit of hackwork that it almost makes the recent horror dud shut in seem focused by comparison .
noé has cut 45 minutes for the current release version . it is desperation surgery . the film i saw was inoperable .
suspension of disbelief is as necessary as popcorn when approaching a summer comic-book movie , but lxg is too preposterous even for this fantastical genre .
the new film looks as if it were made in 1975 , while jewison 's 27-year-old movie seems like up-to-date state-of-the-art .
god might forgive , but the audience won 't .
jean-marc valle deploys a pretty sweeping arsenal of clichs in shoving his camera through the characters ' streams of consciousness .
it seems to have been written by some studio hack screenwriter , isolated from the world since 1941 in some forgotten movie studio storage room stocked with spam , lucky strikes and a copy of the monroe doctrine .
stone 's vampy , thumb-on-the-turntable performance is the most hideous bit of creaky past-prime tarting-about since mae west was dropping the same dusty come-ons .
funny this pot-headed comedy is not , man .
this romantic dud is the kind of fowl weather friend everyone will want to pluck . as an affair or two or more to remember , town & country is better off lost & forgotten .
alfredson 's empty aesthetics mimic hollywood conventions but merely exacerbate the hollowness of this entire affair .
she left cheers for this ?! ?
there was a time when you 'd see tommy lee jones and r . lee ermey in a movie and say , "well , it can 't be all bad ." those days are gone forever .
one of the most despicable displays in the collision between consumerism and filmmaking
as predictably intolerable as one might 've anticipated . . .
. . .plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
there is nothing remotely entertaining about this film .
. . .virtually every aspect of night watch feels artificial and nonsensical . . .
when not indulging in nostalgic flipbook-style flashbacks , director keach shoots his material with sub-sitcom flatness , and regularly returns to the indie-balladeer well to amplify the mawkishness .
it feels more like a compilation of skits from a failed comedy show .
when not being a colossal bore , tarantino takes pleasure in offending our moral sensibilities with his adoring portrait of a natural born killer with a thirst for revenge .
the worst movie of the year , and this is the year the lone ranger was released .
a blandly gritty piece of late-august mayhem that 's as forgettable as its generic title .
succeeds only in making one of willis ' previous bombs , hudson hawk look , well , not good , nothing in this part of the time/space continuum can do that , but downright competent
best-case fallout from this joyless tv-land lemon: harrison ford is driven into retirement , diane keaton gets a morning show .
hugely tedious and mostly incomprehensible , quentin tarantino-wannabe dutch director felix van groeningen 's steve + sky is the kind of foreign movie that gives subtitles a bad name .
so bad that russian and american relations may break down and reignite the cold war .
another in a growing line of pretentious james franco disasters nobody will ever see .
a hopelessly rambling , amateurish mess of disjointed thoughts and imagery .
horrible . a waste . how was this ever a hit ?
the christmas turkey has landed , in the form of 20th century fox 's worst blockbuster ever .
seventh son wraps itself in a bland colored shroud of clichs , making you find reality much more interesting than fiction .
do not take your mom to georgia rule unless she 's roseanne barr . you may expect a three-generational chick flick , but what you get is a child-rape comedy .
it 's a tossup whether the crying jags are inspired by this jumbled script or by the fact that willis has made six dreadful movies in a row .
every moment is surrounded by so much busy nonsense that virtually every plot detail is obscured .
satire points up and emphasizes truths that have gone unnoticed , punctures pretension and tweaks the self-important . audiences laugh at the unexpected revelation of truth . epic movie does none of that .
calling it pretentious doesn 't do justice to the toxic faux-bohemianism and unearned self-regard that bubble and ooze out of every aspect of chelsea walls .
so horrible i didn 't even like it when i was a member of its target audience .
totally bereft of humor , an insult to the intelligence of anyone over the age of reason , reprehensibly crude , this is worse than stupid .
one of the most beautiful dumpsters i 've ever seen .
one of the many repulsive things about the film is the simple-minded moralizing that blights all three tales .
the pun-fueled dialogue is a perfect match for the visual ugliness .
the story is simple , easy , and fun .
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire .
after 90-odd minutes of bludgeoning us into open-jawed bafflement , shadowboxer is best aborted , and flushed away as one of 2006 's more unpleasant memories .
this awful attempt to do a movie biography of the marquis de sade falls flat , with embarrassing performances from all of the actors .
this kids ' cartoon from france is such a surreally demented attempt to connect with children that it 's the equivalent of foie gras breakfast cereal or a bleu cheese milkshake .
i could load you up with more plot details , but this mercilessly incoherent , galactically stupid movie left me too numb to type .
at 83 minutes , it 's tedious , pretentious , and just plain boring . i kept waiting for something to happen , but nothing does .
trapped in the 1980s , when chuck norris ruled the roost of disposable shoot-em-ups . this repulsive macho fantasy seems expressly designed to appeal to the readers of soldier of fortune magazine .
i 'm not calling for marvin the martian to lead a parade of pink elephants down main street , but what 's the point of animating if the end goal is to simply trace over an abc afterschool special ?
secret obsession is a soulless lump of generic mush that aspires to the cheese level of a lifetime original joint but doesn 't come anywhere close .
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen . depressing , random , and dumb . what did i do to deserve this movie ? who knows ?
not a single moment in this automotive snuff film isn 't ridiculous , and its only mystery is why the estimable ethan hawke agreed to star .
a remarkable film: remarkably empty , remarkably noisy , remarkably pleasureless .
not just a fake biopic , a totally fake biopic!
this movie should be titled "foul plane" it is so offensive and humorless .
it 's so bad , i begged the projectionist to show me the haunting instead .
take dumb & dumber , add a wrestling angle to the storyline , and strip the proceedings of all signs of wit , interest , and laughs .
has a film director ever induced such terrible performances from such great actors ? liam neeson - wooden , ewan mcgregor - monotone and the oscar winning natalie portman - a speaking alarm clock!
resident evil: apocalypse is the kind of movie that causes you to drink tequila until every brain cell in your head responsible for remembering the film is dead .
hopefully , inferno marks the end of the robert langdon movies . they fail as adaptations , they fail as thrillers , they fail as a showcase for tom hanks ' talent .
pass that can of black flag , hon .
nothing was resolved in the end except for the fact that i hated it .
this comedy is an absolute waste of time and easily the worst movie of 2010 .
while it 's true that many of the scenes would be hard to perform without breaking into laughter , it 's often difficult to share in the mirth . call it hermetically sealed humor .
utterly inept .
the outcome is guaranteed to try anyone 's patience .
one of the peking opera-trained superstar 's most mediocre films , rivaling last year 's god-awful the tuxedo for sheer messy filmmaking and brazen acts of tedium .
watching stolen summer makes one question the entire project greenlight process , starting with the notion that anyone off the street is fit to write and direct a motion picture if only they want it badly enough .
unlike trey parker , sandler doesn 't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
legion has the audacity to set itself up for sequels without giving the audience enough compelling reason to care about this first installment .
you could get angry that a guy like this even got a chance . or you could just forget about him , and move on to something worthwhile .
this is one occasion , however , when sticking around to the very end does not have its rewards .
there is no excuse
racist , repetitive and ridiculous - unless you 're a devoted fan of spanish telenovas .

josh becomes increasingly distraught and depressed , but not nearly as much as the poor people watching the movie .
if there is a bright spot to be found beyond the unbearable filmmaking stench of desperation , it is janeane garofalo .

throughout queen of the desert 's narrative , there 's no sense of danger , of texture , or even of a rudimentary idea of what 's truly driving gertrude bell .
i can hear the pitch for this one: 'a sex comedy for the whole family . '
the preceding parts are so literal minded , as both puritanical and pornographic illustrations of an obnoxious male fantasy , that they strike me as alternately absurd and hypocritical .
over the years , i remember thinking "what the heck was that ?" after seeing several movies with , uh , quirky concepts .
what it lacks in laughs -- there are none -- it tries to make up for by ladling on stale clichs , such as vardalos ' two stereotypically gay assistants and a desperate younger female friend who stalks guys .
you 'd think troy duffy would have learned something in the decade since he blew his golden ticket with the boondock saints .
padraig reynolds 's film has no interest in self-awareness , and in fact wears stupidity as a sort of badge of honor .
gigli is a traffic accident you can 't keep your eyes off of . if you have a taste for morbid curiosity , go see it .
transformers: age of extinction isn 't a bad movie; it 's the worst possible product of a big hollywood system drunk on a cocktail of fermented nostalgia and rancid profiteering while driving moviegoing into the ground .
a tedious shambles .
tucker must not need to be funny since the loudmouth can take his $25 million payday and laugh all the way to the bank .
a miserable , consistently worthless piece of work . . .

director matt aselton cites buñuel as an influence , but he fails to understand the difference between being a surrealist and being a nonsense-ist .
it doesn 't take long for the question to arise and to linger , unanswered , over a film that never offers an answer: why in the world did anyone make this movie ?

nothing more than a pretentious , incoherent and boring exercise in self-indulgent weirdness .
father forgive them - jesus whipped
there 's funny and then there 's funny , and "a good old-fashioned orgy" is neither .
no description of it can quite contain its misguided ludicrousness or the way its infinite and varied sins against the traits of good cinema combine to produce one of the most uproarious unintentional comedies ever made .
with one head-gnawing plot contrivance after another , it may think it 's the wacky iraq version of easy rider but is more like this year 's around the bend or diamonds .
if "think like a man too" was a man , he would be the world 's worst date: humorless , shrill , speaking primarily in clichs ("what happens in vegas stays in vegas!") and absolutely terrified of women .
a truly pathetic thriller .
so bad , in so many ways . . . bay has turned in his longest movie outside of pearl harbor (2001) , and arguably his most soul-sucking to date .

hatefully stupid and unfunny .
it 's a lot like hearing the play-by-play account of a heated game of bridge . only not half as gripping .
i think i have laughed more at funerals , which is somewhat appropriate for this movie . the pink panther is a funeral for steve martin 's dignity and soul .

universal has done the unthinkable--they 've created the anti-matrix , the summer event movie you simply have to avoid .

here 's hoping bruce willis bought something special with whatever cash he earned from this pointless , brutally ugly rehash of 1973 's "westworld ."

a colorful brochure; a watchtower for new-age mysticism
how can screenwriter john scott shepherd look at himself in the mirror after turning out such uninspired , immature , mechanical , cliche-driven , insultingly predictable drivel ?
monster trucks is undoubtedly an effort to capture the spirit of 1980s-era kiddie sci-fi; unfortunately , it 's just not a very good one .
if you survive this experience you will be scarred , and unlike the first two disturbing but effectively horrific films in this series , it won 't even feel like a personal achievement .
i find it staggering that this series has somehow spawned five actual wide-release films .
when a film critic starts throwing popcorn at the movie screen , something has to be wrong .
if the emoji movie were trying to be funny and missing , or even striving for so-bad-it 's-entertaining territory , it wouldn 't be as tediously awful as the wishy-washy product that it is .

no one spoofed in the film -- yes , including jessica simpson -- is more worthy of derision than the people responsible for making it .
a disposable film adaptation that provides nothing but a pretentious desperation for fox to kick off another franchise .

gives sequels a bad name
pretentious , uninvolving headscratcher that aims to be tragic and uplifting and falls way short; the only thing it 'll lift is your butt from your seat midway through the film .
needless to say , the gore level is high and the scare level low -- although not as low as the intelligence level .
you could spend the entire movie texting your friends and not miss a thing , which i suppose its target audience may consider an asset .
one of the worst films of 2011 . the script and editing are so horrific that it made sigourney weaver and alfred molina , two great actors , look bad . stay far away!
i wished a bottle would roll by so i could stick an s .o .s . in it .
the movie is like being waterboarded by liberals outside a democratic national committee event .
none of the jokes are funny , none of the characters make sense and little of the action is even worthwhile . stay as far away as possible .
this is possibly the most joy-sucking film of 2011 .
a misfire in every way , this franchise reboot is a noisy , incomprehensible mess of a film that almost makes worse use of the character than it does of the 3d technology .
with the original exorcist back at the multiplex , you don 't need this pale copy .
remarkably inept .
playing to stereotypes and terrible jokes , it is mostly unfunny , frequently offensive and entirely dumb .
i can 't hate this film enough .
if his last days were really this banal , it 's no wonder he killed himself .
neither horror , nor comedy . it 's barely even a movie . . .
the 3d conversion is awful . the special effects are awful . the acting is awful . the movie is awful . stay away from this movie .
a bit like having pieces of metal thrown at your face in a wind tunnel .
"claptrap , pure and simple"
noteworthy solely for its thuddingly crude humor .
if dying of boredom was possible , this movie would be lethal .
the whole exercise has the smug feeling of a kevin smith film-- a cameo dumpster that doesn 't even have the wit to kill danny trejo .
the color is beautiful . that 's the only good thing i can say about this film that consists of about 15 minutes of dialogue and 120 minutes of mind-numbing special effects .
why would such a talent as martin lawrence make a totally useless , inane movie ? i 'm guessing that , as usual , money talks .
just about as bad as the first film was . if anything , it 's a little stupider .
poseidon is named after the wrong god . the god of laughter and derision is momus , who was cast out of olympus for mocking zeus , athena and poseidon .
the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
assassin 's creed ultimately comes off as one of the worst and most joyless videogame adaptations ever made . . .
swept away 's worst crime is that it is butt-numbingly b-o-r-i-n-g .
it manages to find an almost pitch-perfect accumulation of ill-matched tones , sheer grotesquerie , near-heroic absurdity and self-canceling folly .
. . .sometimes the film aims for sentiment , sometimes it tries to be funny , other times it wants to be completely revolting . . .
it 's abundantly clear that this is one franchise that is dead in all but name .
like a boss is the worst thing to happen to the cosmetics industry since skin rashes .
bizarrely obsessed with bathroom humor (this would-be sparkling comedy actually begins with a poop joke) and dumb gags at a meeting of sex addicts .
a choppy , feature-length progression of crude , predictable gags , the film plays like a variety show , and yet its main attraction is barely funny enough to warrant his own brief sketch .
let 's be blunt . this is an evil film . it defames christianity , it 's fascist , and while a number of the jokes work , it made me want to puke near the end .
the most mundane , most out-of-touch college romance of the year ?
it 's astonishing how bad this is at fundamentals .
an unintentionally hilarious compendium of time-tested cinematic cliches that illustrates the chasm between hopeful imitation and successful duplication .
the dreck of the dreck .
culminates in a quasi-philosophical orgy of pretense and trashy would-be kicks that takes its rightful place among the worst movies i have ever seen .
the first half is an unfunny drag , with a few uncomfortable laughs provided by a retarded man . the last half is a tragedy .
it 's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn 't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
even vegas vacation was wise enough to distance itself from the humorists responsible for such comedy landmarks as loaded weapon 1 , senior trip and golf punks .
ludicrous , impenetrable and headache-inducing: the newest wesley snipes film , the art of war , is all that and more .
and we have our first lock for the worst of the year list .
not to stoop to hyperbole , but project x might very well be the worst movie ever made in the entire history of cinema .
[director] besson ignores reality and common sense , creating a ludicrous plot that barely provides an excuse for john travolta to do very bad things in paris . . .
the bronze is the worst sports comedy since "the benchwarmers .
horror need not be neat and tidy , but haphazard , unorganized scares with underdeveloped characters and dialogue that rivals fingernails on a chalkboard is beyond untidy . it 's simply unnecessary .
it 's so deadly and unintentionally funny (i hope) that it practically defies description . mr . joff should go back to film school as soon as possible .
fascination would be a good title for a movie that was in any way interesting .
reclaim 's highly mechanized plot ensures that the film is over before it even ends .
it doesn 't just insult your intelligence; it assumes you have none .
scary movie 4 is so lazy it 's downright boring , something not even a naked leslie nielsen (!) can salvage .
green is just plain annoying as gord , a one-dimensional caricature of himself .
the obstacles that the kelly brothers encounter are as uninspired as the film 's treacly lessons about brotherhood and staying true to one 's principles .
confused at its core and too befuddled to make that a virtue .
in which alleged domestic abuser mel gibson encourages a child to commit sexual assault .
the only reason to watch this punishingly dull remake is to ogle raven-haired beauty camilla belle .
the first major release of the year is a complete dud . shocker!
might not be jack black 's best film , but it 's definitely his worst!
i would have assumed that $14 million at least means you can afford some adr sessions .
it seemed as if all of the actors were reading their dialogue from a cue card . the spy next door is already one of the worst films of 2010 . horrible .
retains absolutely none of its predecessor 's manic charm .
the film commits the rookie horror movie mistake of equating suffering with fear . we the audience pay the price .
cornfed curse words fuel a script that doesn 't amount to much more than a hateful snatch of tarantino 's set-bound posturing , spiked with a blend of pre-madonna , semi-intelligible guy ritchie oddballs .
it 's dumb as rocks and thoroughly unnecessary .
dear god . . .
neil marshall should be ashamed for foisting such a disappointing follow-up to the descent on his fans .
summer 2013 has its first bomb , and sadly , it 's landed right on will smith .
smith still has nothing to say , at least nothing printable , either as writer/director or as the dumb (as opposed to dumber) half of jay and silent bob .
not scary but rather is just a disgusting exercise in gore , dismemberment and bloodletting .
it is the room of christmas movies . actually , the room is more enjoyable . but you get the idea .
. . .a pretentious mess . . .
it 's strange that a few people have been saying that this entry is a step in the right direction for the franchise . the only right step this franchise could take would be to end .
a stunt anthology blunders horrifically .
berlin alexanderplatz feels like a saturday afternoon matinee compared to this .
not very funny , i didn 't like it .
this movie is for die-hard usher fans only . and by this i mean teen-age girls , who no doubt will enjoy this .
second act has nothing to recommend it , even as a temporary refuge from traffic gridlock .
that charming thing only works if the story is good .
it could have been something , but . . .
if there exists anyone in the comedy business less funny than the wayans clan , it 's amy sedaris , so she 's here , too .
sure to remain one of the most spiritless cinematic experiences of the year .
laughter-free , joke-free and entertainment-free abomination .
in the slasher genre , this is as bad as they come .
malick thinks he 's an artist . and that 's his problem . he knows he 's an artist , and he 's wallowing in his own artistic waste .
an extremely dull and unfunny comedy with pop-culture references where the gags should be , and humdrum voicings .
. . .vulgar , disgusting , tasteless drivel .
it is so bad that one begins to think it must be a parody of something , but what ?
more like ringling brothers and barnum & bailey 's memoirs of a geisha .
i 'd go so far as to say that if you really liked this film , you have a career working in fast food to look forward to . get it ? fast food ?
a weak comedy that overly relies on jokes from the unholy trinity of p - penises , poop and pee pee .
will 2005 be remembered as the year of the awful horror movies ?
a vile disaster .
why do things like this happen ? why ?
one horrendous film--a shapeless , formless mess with little story and even less sense .
lopez wades through many nonsensical , pompous , gradually annoying dream-logic scenes .
by the end of the film , i just felt sorry for frederick and wondered if another director might be able to find a way to showcase her better .
the whole film echoes jolie 's character -- stylish on the surface with no depth or substance .
as he did in the show , ari single-handedly saves the movie version of entourage from "medellin"-scale disaster .
the kind of movie that keeps you on your toes waiting for the next deadly serious absurdity .
there 's no magic here , only incompetence .
famously bad and its fame is well deserved . [full review in spanish] .
a single joke stretched to feature-length , the dead don 't die asks a few of the most interesting actors on the planet to perform in the middle-school ecology pageant .
this is strictly dull chuckles from dull wits .
. . .astonishingly bad . . .
even by the lax standards of january film releases -- this month is the traditional dumping time for studio films that didn 't quite work out -- the butterfly effect is staggeringly bad .
i 'm trying to think of another film hinging on a phenomenon of towering cultural significance that fritters its running time on as many dumb gimmicks and dopey tropes as this one . i 'm drawing a blank .
minus a shred of farrelly wit .
ridiculous from start to finish . connery , harris , and fishburne couldn 't have wasted their time in a less productive fashion .
this cumbersome and graceless 1950s-set period drama possesses the reactionary life insights and amateurish production values of a lifetime soap .
this is apointless adventure , as well as the same film focused on this pathetic adventure . (complete review in spanish , in the mexican newspaper reforma)
'teenage mutant ninja transformers ' is a hollow shell of a movie .
has [malkovich 's] career really come to this ?
i hesitate to label it the "worst movie of the year" when "worst movie of the century" fits it even better .
the man plays like a sequel to some terrible movie that was mercifully destroyed before it was ever released .
every january , as the "january junk" makes its annoying appearance on the big screen , a lackluster pg-13-rated horror movie is involved . 'the unborn ' is that movie for 2009 .
it 's appallingly awful!
in a sense , this is a horror film , worse than anything andy kaufman could dream up , in which green tries to outgross himself .
it is moronic beyond comprehension , an exercise in desperation during which even sylvester stallone , a repository of self-confidence , seems to be disheartened .
your laugh mileage may vary (god forbid) , but we can all agree on one thing: this is the biggest waste of talent in cinema history .
flailing like a dying fish out of water and eventually smelling just as fetid , four christmases is stiflingly unfunny .
there 's little to recommend about this ugly descent into depravity .
the scary (and gory) things on screen may be zombies , but the real monster here is the troll in the director 's chair .
however hard the talented cast may try , those aren 't people up on the screen; they 're candles , balloons , and marbles .
the worst of the nightmares . don 't bother turning on to this elm street .
if you need to take a nap between the 2nd wave and the 3rd wave , just let slumber overtake you because your dreams will be much more interesting than the 5th wave .
the final scene is so unbelievably , ridiculously terrible in so many ways that you 'd be forgiven for thinking that the entire experience was an elaborate and pointless prank at your expense .
the most unbearable and unwatchable movie experience i 've had this year .
this is hollywood hagiography at its most patronising and preposterous - a product , as well as a celebration , of a diseased , materialistic culture .
no more than a minute into this , and it becomes obvious that the next 98 are going to be trouble .
a complete waste of time .
i 'm tired of filmmakers , screenwriters , directors and studios that believe every holiday is its own excuse for making films .
screenwriters todd komarnicki and jon bokenkamp provide a script with enough foreseeable twists and turns that , if it were an actual road , a blind person wouldn 't have any difficulty handling it .
beautiful ain 't . sally field may be proclaiming "you like me! you really like me!" behind the camera , but don 't be egged on .
while it 's unclear if this nonsense is propaganda for madonna 's kabbalah dogma , there 's absolutely no doubt that revolver achieves a higher plane of badness .
writer/director michael patrick king seems intent on turning carrie into the most irritatingly selfish , shallow , materialistic character ever to hit any screen .
this is gross-out at it 's lamest . give it a pass .
the worst american film i 've seen this year .
horrible .
defying space and time , we will see one of the worse films of this year .
i haven 't seen action scenes shot and edited this badly since the 2002 remake of rollerball .
whenever i see cruddy movies such as "the man ," i figured that the actors either owed somebody a favor or signed a contract .
"plenty of corn , for sure , but no chills"
a boring , badly written , cliche-heavy outing with lousy production values , various moral messages unfit for childhood consumption and songs from the known-carcinogen school of pop .
it 's an aesthetic assault notable not just for its belligerence , but also for its tedious excess .
garbage--fetid and painful .
the language and the points of view are disgusting . this is a film that is in such poor taste that it 's almost impossible to endure .
. . .suffers from an unpleasant and relentlessly distracting animation style that ultimately renders its few positive attributes moot .
a waste of mccarthy 's considerable talent , this comedy is painfully groan-inducing and obnoxious .
a lost opportunity . [full review in spanish]
river phoenix gives a somnambulant impersonation of christian slater impersonating jack nicholson , and samantha mathis spends much of the movie trying to figure out exactly who her character is .
it 's like muppets take manhattan , but replace a milquetoast young artiste for an amnesiac frog and a group of muppets for a post-racial group of seamlessly integrated metrosexuals .
degenerates into a tedious series of unamusing and rather forced gross-out gags .
one of the most ridiculous action-thrillers of the year .
there 's something seriously wrong when you assemble actors this good -- and can 't believe a single stilted word coming out of their mouths .
gaping gaps in the plotline recede into the background in the face of ordinary car chases that routinely look plastic and an embarrassingly low-brow extended climax that feels like the work of an entry-level animation student .
a colossal dumpster fire mess of a movie that is stringed together by a terrible script and tired gangster film tropes .
stupefying in its unfunniness , arrogance and outright narcissism , a million ways to die in the west is a shoo-in for my worst of the year list come december .
even the addition of an oscar-winning director in bill condon ("kinsey ," "gods and monsters") fails to save what is essentially a padded-out tale of all-consuming love and loyalty .
when it comes to knockaround guys , the only remotely energetic aspect of the project is the fact that characters occasionally use words with more than two syllables .
what was tommy lee jones thinking ?
i fought the urge to punch someone once it finally ended .
giving this movie money is re-enforcing everything wrong with the industry , and possibly everything wrong with the world .
if this is what the "golden years" are going to be like , count me out .
there are really bad films and then there are painful films . grown ups falls into the latter category . the movie lost steam after ten minutes!
near the end of the story , michael keaton utters what could come to be regarded as the direst threat in movie history: 'from now on , it 's malby time . '
a knight 's tale is a boil on the festering malignant state of the cinema and it should be lanced immediately .
there was not much to like from this film . the dialogue was bland; the story was lame and felt nothing like what real life is all about .
the most inane and inept hootfest (or , for that matter , hooterfest) to hit the big screen since showgirls .
a movie completely and utterly designed around one special effect repeated over and over and over and over again to the point of cartoonishness .
verhoeven , a dutch filmmaker whose early works include the dazzlingly intelligent and anarchic the fourth man , has clearly lost his soul in hollywood .
it feels more like a compilation of skits from a failed comedy show .
renaissance fair: the movie .
even a third act demolition derby tribute to the blues brothers can 't revitalize this stiff .
the film is impossible to take seriously as a commemoration of moultrie 's life or allen 's prolific status because of its plethora of contrivances .
i suspect that this is a film that speaks to those who believe every breath you take is a love song .
. . .it 's hard to imagine anyone walking away from the film satisfied (this includes the folks responsible for making the movie) .
as vapid and false as the polar express , hop and the tale of dwayne johnson becoming the tooth fairy . combined .
it 's depressing enough to sit through an unfunny comedy , but it 's worse to watch falk , penn and berg having to earn a living like this .
half-baked mess!
sadly , the film lacks its hero 's willingness to "go there" for the sake of glory , and winds up merely middling - a fatal flaw .
the movie has more dead scenes than a monday night in magnitogorsk .
a uniquely charmless motion picture , owing in no small part to the hideous , "attach a corpse to a car battery" quality of the herky-jerky animation .
straight viewing could result in brain damage .
most everyone in the audience , except those rendered unconscious by boredom , will see the 'big twist ' plot turn coming well in advance , although the qualifiers 'big ' and 'twist ' seem overblown and inexact .
a desperately unfunny action comedy , mirthless not only in its effect on an audience but in its whole aura .
calling the picture an insult to the immune deficiency syndrome is inappropriate; however , calling the movie an act of pure idiocy is bordering generosity .
[i]diotic in addition to being irresponsible .
less movie than fawning infomercial .
paramount was wise to release this one in december--just in time for critics to fit the film onto their year-end worst lists .
a movie full of gestures that would look over-the-top in primary school plays .
the problem with an action hero who banks largely on the extent to which he thinks things are boring is that , after a certain point , the audience will agree .
over her dead body is to romantic comedy what spam is to meat . but at least with spam , you get cool packaging .
it fails so completely at its reach for lowness that you may find yourself crying out for mel brooks , monty python , hell even cheech or chong to swoop in and save the thing . no such luck .
within 20 minutes of this incongruous baloney , i knew i 'd stumbled upon a potential razzie .
for losers
do some blow . curse humanity . convert to nilhilism . reread american psycho . but don 't for the love of god and cinema see the informers .
bubble boy 's producers should never be allowed to see another film , let alone make one .
while there is undoubtedly a fine movie to be made from snow falling on cedars , this version , despite some of the acting and the photography , is not it .
kicking and screaming feels as if it were callously vomited out by a machine , along with a couple of spare parts and some putrid grease .
not only disgusting and unendurable , but filthy and boring , too .
congratulations , denise richards; you 're no longer the most laughable movie scientist of all time .
an unfunny comedy with lack of soul , story , and stunts which prove pranks can 't make a movie without craft and authenticity .
more disconcerting is the idea put forward that self-indulgence is a substitute for structured education , or , more to the point , that it 's a substitute for life .
. . . awful film .
beresford directs without purpose or polish , and his mostly fine cast , which includes kyle maclachlan and rosanna arquette in bit parts , is wasted .
when the dream sequence killing off the cast is better than everything afterward , you might have a script problem . . . this is why we can 't have good vampire movies .
it 's a promising concept , but instead of expending effort on , say , a coherent script , the filmmakers lazily rely on cheap editing tricks and gleefully relentless sadism .
the aim of rings may have been to revive a long-dormant horror franchise , but the outcome is likely to be forgotten even before all the end credits have rolled .
the worst movie in the series is also a complete scam for the viewer . [full review in spanish] .
how dismally arch and self-satisfied can a chelseacore sex comedy get ?
how do i start in describing this disaster of a movie ?
my best advice to anyone reading this review -- even someone who considers himself or herself a fan of horror movies -- is to stay away .
despite its title , little fockers barely features children . other things it 's lacking include laughs , coherence , and a reason to exist
"would you guys just figure out what the fuck you 're talking about ?" actual line from the film . actual way you might feel by the time that line is uttered .
. . .is a break from trash like this . just awful!
bark is terrible . terrible , terrible , terrible .
this is the end of the highlander series , they say . not an eon too soon .
i have no idea for whom this movie was made .
it 's "the heights: the movie ," and who the blazes remembers "the heights" (besides jamie walters ' friends and loved ones , of course) ?
an awkward , painful mash-up of horror and comedy that induces all the wrong kind of squirms , nekrotronic feels like a z-grade syfy channel movie that escaped its basic-cable confines .
the month is irrelevant; miss march would be a dog no matter where it fell on the calendar .
everyone 's phoning it in for the first two hours . and let me point out something that i 've just said there: 'the first . two . hours . '
the movie they should show the condemned while they ride the ferry crossing the river styx .
as a character study , the glass castle is a fascinating glimpse at the intersection of love , abuse , compassion , neglect , broken promises , and familial duties .
make sure the other people in the audience don 't hear you snoring through the movie 's 5 million poker playing scenes . by the fifth all in , i wanted all out .
say this for cassie sullivan (chlo grace moretz): no matter how bad things get during the alien-wrought apocalypse , her hair looks great .
train wreck!
charlie 's angels is like the trailer for a video game movie , lacking only the video game , and the movie .
vapid , overlong , painfully unfunny , preposterous and , worst of all , boring . it 's so bad that it 's gone past good and back to bad again .
if you have a roommate you really want to see suffer , here 's a suggestion: buy him or her a ticket to dead man on campus .
van peebles ' interpretation of an android puts one more in mind of some monstrously malformed pinocchio than the gentle giant for which the producers were so obviously aiming .
this movie should be titled "foul plane" it is so offensive and humorless .
. . .norm of the north needs to be put back in the bottom of the walmart bargain bin where it belongs .
"self/less" ultimately earns its title , but it could just as easily have been called "brain/less ," "pulse/less" and "point/less ."
they fight , and look rubbish , and one eats an aircraft . is bad the new good ? i wish . sometimes bad is just tacky .
the legend of chun-li is as vapid and dull as it is .
quite possibly the world 's first horror-musical-sex-comedy , the strangely impressive originality of poultrygeist: night of the chicken dead doesn 't come even close to compensating for its everything-+-the-kitchen-sink midnight-movie awfulness .
why is gerard butler still making action movies ? why is there one more . . .has fallen flick ?
perhaps best enjoyed by persons who have been lobotomized . after the first 30 minutes (i 'm being generous) , you may well feel like you have been .
a horror in its utter lack of logic and in its demonstration that human relationships are as exciting and rewarding as a puddle of swamp goo infested with mosquitoes .
transformers: age of extinction , despite the hopeful ring of finality in the title , is merely another chapter in the saga , and far and away the worst one so far .
our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender - and i know this because i 've seen 'jackass: the movie . '
this isn 't exactly a movie review .but "hostel: part ii" isn 't exactly a movie . it is pornography %u2013 shockingly violent , grotesque pornography .
it 's too bad [portman and frain 's] contributions , and those of many others , drown in a big glop of treacle .
the dumbed down summer blockbuster of all dumbed down summer blockbusters
perhaps it 's not within the purview of a mere critic to question the judgment if not the sanity of disney executives who green-lit this travesty , but who exactly did they envision to be the audience ?
if you don 't guess the big twist in this story by 15 minutes into the film , you fell asleep at 10 minutes .
if only the movies based on nicholas sparks ' novels didn 't take themselves so seriously . if only they had a sense of their soapiness , and embraced their naked emotional absurdity .
it 's a sloppy movie , an ostensible horror film lacking in scares and weighed down by half-realized mythology and numerous repetitive stretches .
[phoenix] , the mumbling master of smug self-indulgence , dons another layer of emperor 's new duds to favor us with a performance as subtle as a fart in a sardined elevator and twice as odiferous .
not only is this an amateurish travesty combining fundamentalist christian eschatology with disaster movie b .s . , but it 's plodding and tedious .
'i 'm 19 , but i 'm petulant ' somehow sums it up .
shottas has everything a bad music video should have -- close-ups of foreign sports cars , women with painful-looking implants stepping in and out of hot tubs , ugly men with gold teeth waving around automatics .
no real setup , minimal explanation as to why it 's happening .
jenny mccarthy 's giddy charm is wasted by screen writer jenny mccarthy .
the most obnoxious , noisy , tedious , ugly waste of film this year .
as usual with almodovar , there is no one to care for; it 's detached , smug , empty camp .
by this point , none of the pieces fits and absolutely nothing makes any sense .
when the camera panned to look straight up ashley scott 's legs , i was morally certain that director john stockwell had spent his formative years tying mirrors to his shoes .
anything more would be cheating the great wide swaths of gibbering no-brow-bia: the baseball-cap-askew-nation , text-messaging their way through the dead spots .
does sparks have to treat people like total idiots . . . ? . . .[a] soulless-cash-grab .
painfully unfunny comedy that lacks every sense of wit , charm , and most of all competent filmmaking that should 've stayed unreleased .
in this day and age , things like this shouldn 't be allowed to happen .
marsden has blue eyes and clean-cut looks tailor-made for a bop pinup--and all the emotional depth and acting range of the page it would be printed on .
. . .stupid and irreverent in a useless way , and a bunch of crappy songs don 't help .
"birds of prey: and the fantabulous emancipation of one harley quinn" is more than horrible . it should not exist .
those hoping for inside dirt will instead be rewarded with a fictitious , shoddy piece of claptrap that has nothing to say about springer . . .
in his 1999 debut , deuce bigalow emerged as a shameless beach bum , driving a clunker in a land of porsche cayennes , cleaning the scum from the fish tanks of the rich and famous .
bad and baffling from the get-go .
the really frustrating thing about tomatoes is the toothlessness of its satire .
so bad it 's painful . if there wasn 't a "terminator ," there would be no "ahnuld ."
i 'd call this stenchcloud 'fatal attraction meets the temp , ' but that would insult those movies .
i hate this film .
in addition to being tasteless , shoddily written and unimaginatively staged , operation finale is just amazingly dull .
the film wanders around aimlessly like a ship without a rudder or a captain .
stupefyingly horrendous .
it might could have been something dark and delicious , but the amateur direction , plodding plot progression , and sappy score doom this one to the crummy side of the awesomely bifurcated cage collection .
. . .plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
there 's nothing that poignant here , just de palma pretending he 's carl sagan .
for 89 minutes that feel like 89 hours , cars speed out of control and crash doing only pg-13 damage . the damage to your brain while watching it is incalculable .
it is an irredeemable affair .
it gives off the alienating feel of an inside joke that you miss in the off chance you 're not part of the professional magic business .
fifty shades darker isn 't love . it 's abuse . pure and simple .
i left hoping that i never see either of them again in anything .
as a portrait of a self-pitying drunk 's wet dream of inexplicable atonement , it 's fairly effective , but as a story meant to take place on some rational version of planet earth , it 's utterly hopeless .
here 's a familiar story so badly executed that not even the characters pay attention to what 's going on in it .
[a film for] pre-brain playstation 11-year-old american males . . .
horribly written , shockingly amateur . contrived and exhausting don 't begin to summarize this inert disaster .
you know that when an acting joke like christopher lambert won 't even return for the sequel , some fragile line has been crossed .
i 'd be shocked if even a totally wasted phish fan could find many laughs .
other than confusing children , it 's hard to know what the inane , tedious , mean-spirited barnyard is trying to do .
grab the kiddos and head out to see this one , especially if little joey has always wanted to feast his eyes on a grown man waxing a dog 's testicles .
this is one of those nasty little films that tries very hard to obscure its misogynist and racist premise through pseudo political critique .
a lot of shouting offered up as an ineffectual camouflage to the picture 's complete lack of ambition .
as lost as the audience gets , no one in the auditorium can come close to the bewilderment exhibited by the cast .
the language is filthy , the film is simpleminded , and bronson 's character is as despicable as those he murders .
say what you will about boaz yakin 's epically awful death in love , but it wastes no time letting you know what you 're in for .
abort .
mamet is now only as he has ever been: a good academic and a really bad filmmaker , though on the bright side , he did resist casting one of his mannequin wives this time around
the most slapped-together , pointless , allover terrible horror film of 2013; and i will remind you that 2013 bore witness to texas chainsaw 3d .
jumper is riddled with plot holes and useless action sequences in a wasted attempt to fill time .
just awful .
when will hollywood learn that successful animated concepts just don 't cut it when translated to flesh-and blood life ?
absolutely pointless sequel without an ounce of creativity .
for a prime example of hollywood 's dearth of imagination one need look no further than stealth
unlike the modern glamour-vamps of true blood and twilight , this group of smitten and bitten men are no fun at all .
everything about this film stinks .

a talky bore that spends too much time in wood-panelled offices and at chatter-heavy parties that were clearly shot on the cheap .

i will say this about nights in rodanthe: spoken nicholas sparks is preferable to written nicholas sparks .
all the martial arts movies have become clichés . this film is worse than stupid . enough!
the film 's directors , david moreau and xavier palud , bring nothing new to the table , and they aren 't even particularly adept at reheating the leftovers .
resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter 's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
director burr should never have shouted 'cut . '
why , and at what point , did feig choose to ally himself with the bullies of the world and substitute broad stereotype for insight into character ?
the film reveals no great truths about human nature or drug abuse , the dialogue is witless , the acting unconstrained .
. . .two hours of brutality , excrement and viscera . yes , some segments disturb and repel , and many try for dark humor , but the squirms they induce are far from pleasurable .
"you will need a lot of patience . a lot" .
211 . . . is a shoe-in for worst film of the year , and frankly belongs in the conversation for worst films of the century thus far .
a complete and utter mess . . .
seriously . bad . there , i just saved you 9 dollars .
this excruciating comedy tests the limits of how many shots to the crotch a movie can show , or an audience can absorb .

i liked the first two , but this franchise has expired .
almost entirely garbage .
i know it 's early but this one is already a prime contender for worst movie of the year
a debacle that suggests there 's nothing like some good old-fashioned american weaponry to solve the world 's problems .
writer/director michael patrick king seems intent on turning carrie into the most irritatingly selfish , shallow , materialistic character ever to hit any screen .
if you 're like most of the human race and it takes more than a gross-out gag to tickle your funny bone , do yourself a favor and steer clear of this monstrosity of a movie .
even on the level of killer-virus-gone-wild gore-fest , the crazies as rejiggered by eisner is a dud .
never has a fascinating setup for a movie failed so miserably as it does in "godsend ."
my cat has coughed up hairballs that make more sense than miami vice
slipstream is utterly unwatchable . i hated every minute of it .
not even watchable . this freakish film defines "lowbrow ."
"parker" winds up with the worst of both worlds: it 's pointlessly violent and nauseatingly cute .
everybody should be ashamed
suddenly i 'm nostalgic for battlefield earth .
ishtar is a truly dreadful film , a lifeless , massive , lumbering exercise in failed comedy .
the film aims only to shock , refusing to deliver anything in an intriguingly post-ironic way in the process .
every barely competent line or gag from the original has been deleted or replaced with gobsmacking doggerel .
maybe i should let a role of the dice determine whether i use a cudgel or a broadsword to put this puppy out of its misery ?
. . .just another fat sitcom loser who never changes and his young , gorgeous , savvy wife who apparently doesn 't have the self-respect to dump the schmuck .
fire . water . air . earth . whatever . everyone is so out of their element with the core that not even milla jovovich could save it .
dead on arrival .
so confused in its approach and its message , that it actually reaches the point where i wonder if it is a satire of satires .
loathsome as any mindless , blood-drenched hollywood action-adventure yarn .
looks like it was directed by a blind and deaf person over a weekend on a leftover laboratory set from a tv show and edited with a roulette wheel .
in what universe does a new york jewish socialite and a hardcore , streetwise rapper sound like a good pairing for a romantic comedy ?
a strong argument for birth control and 2007 's worst comedy to date .
she 's out of control is simultaneously so bizarre and so banal that it 's a first: the first movie fabricated entirely from sitcom cliches and plastic lifestyles , without reference to any known plane of reality .
so bad in so many different ways that perhaps you should see it , as an example of the lowest slopes of the bell-shaped curve .
another vacuous melodrama/thriller that doesn 't lay a glove on the era 's historical complexities .
despite the overwhelming demand for treat williams/joe piscopo team-ups , this effort remains surprisingly hard to find .
a negligent film that never follows through with its promise to be funny .
. . .oppressive and tedious and interminable .
this got financing ?
the success of the tv series was due to the brilliance of don adams , barbara feldon , and edward platt . carrell , hathaway , and arkin miss the mark by miles .
it doesn 't take a detective to determine it 's not the fault of tyler perry that 'alex cross ' is subpar .
without daddy 's money . . .coppola 's emaciated screenplay would still be moldering on her hard drive as the author worked the 10-4 shift at the starbucks on figueroa .
like a bad episode of 21 jump street .
another cuba gooding jr . dud . don 't show him the money -- show him the door!
a movie this cheerful is destined to be awful to audiences over ten years of age . . .
sad to say that after its unpromising opening minutes , the film defies the odds by getting progressively worse .
it 's physically painful to have to sit in a theater for more than 90 minutes and be continually assaulted by such drivel as ferrell puts on the screen .
sometimes you only know it 's a comedy because familiar comic actors - [tony] shalhoub , rob corddry , ken jeong and rebel wilson - pop up amid the mayhem .
. . .historically laughable , it 's so boring it makes one yearn to watch grass grow .
just don 't waste your time or money .
be ashamed , robert de niro , be deeply ashamed of every scene of dirty grandpa , a sleazy comedy spurting unfunny jokes from a lost time .
notable only for the spectacle of watching both prinze and biel getting out-performed in the same motion picture by matthew lillard .
essentially an x-files episode that wishes it were as disturbing and visually arresting as david fincher 's seven (it 's not) .
what might have been a frank portrayal of high school culture and challenges ends up veering between being either too cynically hyper-sexual or preachy .
it is offensive on so many levels . first , let 's just call superbabies what it is: child abuse .
while the first film convinced me of bronson 's need for vengeance , this one is just a series of dumb killings .
the invasion is a wretched mess from start to finish , and it taints the reputations of every single person who not only appears in it , but also goes to see it .
this picture has nothing original to say , and the acting is way below par . imagine making a show about kids and then not putting in a single kid (or adult for that matter) that you care about .
the sets are laughably cheap , and the aliens look like geeks from a star trek convention who couldn 't afford to buy the "good" klingon costumes
suffers from a lethargic screenplay , cheap-looking visuals , amateurish acting , and laughable digital special effects that play like failed auditions for the syfy channel .
by the end , this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch .
witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .
should have been titled "cosby 's ghost film career" . and to think poitier directed this thing . it 's a tv comedy skit gone wrong .
[practical magic is] the kind of inconsistent , contradictory story that only employs the covenants of its genre when the script called for it , and not when it would be logical to do so .
a kinky cross of caligula and back to the future!
when making a feature film based on a western horror comic , (don 't) remove it from the old west , sanitize the horrific bits , and mistake the term "comic" for the funny kind .

it occurs to me that the only way this film could have been good would be if tom green were starring in it and it was twenty years ago .
the love guru is downright antifunny , an experience that makes you wonder if you will ever laugh again .
it 's just embarrassing that this made it into theaters .
a misguided and often intolerable trainwreck . . .
the screenplay is chopped up into smutty sound bites constructed around the notion that casual obscenity delivered by respected actors of a certain age is hilarious . but it 's just embarrassing .
you don 't need to have seen the original "species" to appreciate how utterly lousy "species ii" is .
burt and ned should be ashaimed of themselves .
this , folks , is without a doubt , one of the worst movies that has ever made our eyes glaze over .
an idiotic piece of filmmaking .
the high cost of living is yet another example of the high cost (for moviegoers) of lowered production barriers for aspiring filmmakers .
local color is a sappy brick to the audience 's forehead .
a festival of snobbish , yet still plainly sophomoric puns . i 'm not appalled by the vulgarity . . . i 'm appalled by the lack of entertainment .
makes "super mario bros ." look like "rocco and his brothers"!
i felt bad for the cameramen , editors and assistant directors who now must list this vile film on their resumes .
loathsome doesn 't begin to describe it . how about "toxic" ?
want some racism and sexism with your holiday celebration ? the repellent mother 's day has a surprising , distasteful , and shameful amount of both .
it 's so bad that the director 's guild should revoke snyder 's membership and he should never be allowed to direct again .

mock assault on precinct 13 for all of its scene-chewing , stinktastic glory or your head will explode in a rage .
being a film critic is a wonderful job , but there are weeks when the bad film delirium strikes and we 'd all be better off in straitjackets .

you suck , friend request . delete your account .
na , na , na , gonna have a good time ? nay , nay , nay .
most of the acting is lifeless , except for matthew fox who is hamming it up more than fat guy at a bacon festival
the most surprising thing about the movie is that somebody bothered to make it .
a downright miserable experience .
undone by a wildly inconsistent tone , narrative devices that rotate between incongruous cuteness and bald-faced lying , and a protagonist who 's just a horrendous , despicable character .
not only isn 't the new effort up to the standards of the anime , it 's bloody awful by any standard .
this is the kind of werewolf flick that seems to have used up its entire special-effects budget on canine contact lenses .
it 's hard to know what aspect is the most offensive: the glib , cynical approach to mental illness; the sleazy sexism; the infantile attempts at blasphemy; or rockwell 's smug , boorish performance .
insufferably boring , culturally hegemonic , and profoundly ugly .
this movie sucked so bad , i even hated it as a kid .
in space , no one can hear you snore .
the longer the film runs , the more interesting a watchdial becomes .
the oh in ohio 's childish storytelling , paper-thin character development , and general unfunniness combine to make one bad movie .
it 's rob schneider who had something better to do!!!! i have to refer to him forever from this day forward as the smart one .
the dearth of imagination is stupefying . carrey is alternately embarrassing and terrifyingly detached , [and] freeman has sold out .
visually ugly , morally non-existent and a complete black hole in the departments of insight and wit , chapter 27 is quite possibly the most godawful , irredeemable film to yet emerge in the 21st century .
with the passing of the production torch to infamous budget tightwads golan and globus , it was clear that the worst was yet to come .
at this point , it 's tempting to wonder if jeff bridges accepts roles chiefly on the basis of whether or not he 'll get to sport grizzly facial hair and talk funny .
it features so much in the way of awkward and contrived situations that even an extremely talented cast nearly flounders .
there 's a fundamental problem here . the movie relies on the instinctual human fear of death , but its message is that dying is a promotion .
implausibly tedious , stay alive has none of the vicarious thrills of , say , konami 's silent hill 2 . it 's barely even pong unplugged .
for the first time in my life i booed at a movie .
like garlic , holy water and silver bullets for our mythic evildoers , stan helsing is a surefire repellent to any good time .
the only fright likely to be experienced by moviegoers is the fact that they spent hard-earned money on such a turkey .
unless you don 't have air conditioning , live above a chinese restaurant , and are suffering from a 107-degree fever , i can 't think of a single reason to sit through this mess .
this non-stop superficial mugging would not even have been cool if it had come out twelve years ago , when tarantino rip-offs were as common as hootie & the blowfish hit singles .
a trite , arch , frantic , condescending , vaguely racist and homophobic little bonbon of computer generated noise . it 's more like an assault than a movie .
dead men tell no tales marks the continuation of the pirates of the caribbean franchise 's slow , steady sink to the bottom .
if your kid has recently suffered brain damage or undergone a frontal lobotomy , they probably still won 't be fooled by this cookie-cutting , lifeless drudge .
i 'd like to tell you how rabid , illogical , far-fetched and stupid colossal is , but words fail me at last .
any picture featuring a sped-up version of the "william tell overture" is so drunk on its own whimsy that it most likely sucks with a dedicated vigour .
this is a vastly inferior toy-to-film ip expansion , with duller songs , dumber jokes , and forgettable voice work .
rarely are films produced without an ounce of motivation or purpose , yet the pacifier was green-lit by one of the world(tm)s largest corporations apparently without anyone realizing that nothing in it makes a lick of sense .
how this managed not to go direct-to-dvd (and actually get a wide distribution rather than just a handful-of-theaters dump) is one of 2010 's great cinematic mysteries .
children plays a cruel trick .
an inane , painfully unfunny comedy .
if you saw mandy and wished more nicolas cage movies were dark , weird , and personal: watch between worlds and be careful what you wish for .
the film puts the word 'con ' in contraband because its primary goal is to rob you of your money . if you plan on seeing it , please locate your nearest emergency exits before the lights go down .
is dinesh d 'souza stupid ? this seems like kind of faux-innocent question the far-right columnist and polemicist poses all the time . but the answer honestly isn 't clear .
for a horror-comedy film to work , it 's got to be both funny and scary . tales from the crypt presents bordello of blood is neither .
so haphazardly fails to recognize the ironies of its own failings that it unwittingly makes george w . bush funnier . . .when he 's trying to be funny .
messrs . friedberg and seltzer make their annual locust-like descent on theaters leaving a trail of ruthlessly murdered brain cells in their wake .
"rock the kasbah" is an extremely stilted piece of work that suffocates the talents of its actors .
awesomeness seems to be the chief quality prized by both the film and its characters; all other considerations-like safety , property damage , and especially good taste-are secondary .
"what 's the point of any of this ?" asks cassie . i kept hoping , but no such luck . it 's a question that is never answered .
a strong contender for the worst football movie ever made . . .
visually repulsive and not far behind on a sonic level .
regardless of your views on shakespeare 's authorship , anonymous is an insulting , plodding , dull , unfocused junk heap of a film .
there 's no deliberate texas chainsaw massacre 2-style comedy to the film , just dim-witted gruesomeness retrofitted with gimmicky contemporary trappings .
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .
an incoherent mess , a jumble of footage in search of plot , meaning , rhythm and sense .
nihilistic , amoral , self-congratulatory wanking .
green relentlessly gives himself and only himself pleasure during the course of this alleged comedy 's torturous 100 minutes .
since director sfar didn 't think it important to deal with the "facts" of gainsbourg 's interesting life , what 's the point of seeing his phantasmagoric film ?

like a lobotomized guess who 's coming to dinner ? -- with a horny goat thrown in .
with the corpse of a nightmare called knight of cups , i have finally given up on terrence malick . this dog of a film is as riveting and fascinating as a walk-in bathtub .
ultimately , any movie in which even morgan freeman manages to give a lackluster performance can only be considered a seriously botched job .
[a] dim , dull effort . . .
a movie this silly should be prefaced with an apology: "um , about last knights . . . "
born of a desire to make money off of children who don 't know any better and their indulgent parents who should .
download the trailer . it 's cheaper , quicker , and efficiently shows you everything you think you want to see from the movie .
an unembarrassed movie musical , something my generation experienced only in sunday-afternoon movies on tv .
while it is probably apocryphal that carter was the model for the role of the delusional lars in the film "lars and the real girl ," the resemblance is astonishing .
here 's an excruciatingly dated and derivative new york cop movie .
land of the lost isn 't a movie , it 's an endurance test .
the effects were great , the story was dumb . i hate this movie .
leapin ' lizards! the evergreen broadway musical "annie ' ' strays far from its depression-era roots with truly dismaying results in this crass , charmless , tineared and lead-footed update .
gigli looks like a movie that writer-director martin brest made up on the spot .
wolodarsky has made a film that even a rabid lowbrow like homer simpson (or , when the mood strikes , this critic) would find beneath his dignity .
"alien" knock-off no . 963 traps its cast in a deep-sea story as lifeless as the mariana trench .
. . .numbingly unfunny .
a complete snooze -- it doesn 't even qualify as a nightmare .
this here is a violent southern soap with delusions of respectability , and it 's a pity it tried to put on such fancy airs .
it 's more run-of-the-mill than it is colossally misguided .
you know exactly what you 're getting into when you sit down to watch a movie in which there is not only one but many giant super snakes . . .please tell me you know .
fetching a pail of water would be more entertaining than watching this torture .
mostly the film morphs into a block of dullness .
unoriginal behavior such as this should be shunned , not encouraged .
the v stands for 'very ," the i "idiotic ." i don 't know what letter stands for the end of kathleen turner 's career .
while i think it 's cute that people get all dressed up and have little parties going to this movie , the actual film is a hellish , embarrassing abomination .

the screenwriter of the departed aims for a statement about the perils of fame , but instead comes off as the poster boy for toxic celebrity narcissism .
this may be the most uncompelling summer movie contender in the history of the sport .
military-industrial uncomplicated . . .despite the theme that "magic does exist" ("it was found long ago . inside a crashed alien ship") , the last knight is all mirthless jokes and thrill-less mayhem .
dangerfield gets all his celebrity friends to cameo -- and they 've never been worse!
and i thought i now pronounce you chuck & larry was hypocritical .
. . . an angry , bitter and abhorrent display of masochism masquerading around as a legitimate horror film .
oh , i get it , haha , this is some kind of joke , right ?
not funny , and certainly shouldn 't be rated a kid-friendly pg either .
as sexy as a rodeo clown and much slower .
lower what little expectation you have going in and you 'll still be disappointed .
i took one for the team this week . . . if your kid is a yu-gi-oh fan , then god help you .
"left behind" is terrible because it 's poorly written , flat in tone and generally pandering to the faithful by not offering any complexity whatsoever .
a film so boring , overextended and endlessly moronic that my high school called to downgrade my gpa for having sat through it .
zookeeper is essentially a surreally awful happy madison productions version of mad libs .
the script that nicholas klein has conjured from bono 's idea is a quicksand that sucks down a solid cast .
not since "the hangover: part iii" has so many unlikeable male characters caused so much damage to themselves and to the innocent bystanders around them .
a predictable and cliched affair featuring seemingly intelligent characters who can 't stop making terrible decisions .
an all around unfortunate and ill-conceived endeavor , it 's a lee feature for completists only .

no laughs in this one at all . who decided to write a movie about a club designer ? boring concept , no chemistry .
clint eastwood turns a terrorist attack into a bit of post-hoc reality 'entertainment ' with the stunt casting of the actual heroes as themselves in a stilted , tone-deaf piece of christian-american propaganda .
screwed is a low-brow dognapping caper comedy that had all the early warning signs of a real stinker .
unless restrained by another , far superior creative force (p .t . anderson , judd apatow) , sandler 's recent career is a cautionary tale in self-mutilation .
unwatchable .
the script to 'sinister 2 ' is a mess . mostly , it 's boring , but it 's also a hodgepodge of ineffectual dialogue and setups .
a truly misguided and tedious piece of work . . .
there are a great many examples of "no" in devil . . . no suspense . no scares . no originality . no fun . no reason to bestir oneself to see it .
speed racer is the wachowskis on overdrive and the result is a garish nightmare that looks like andy and larry ate a kaleidoscope , then vomited all over the screen .
this film is a cinematic hate crime .
so horrible i didn 't even like it when i was a member of its target audience .
this fil
a catastrophe! reese witherspoon 's bad acting turns becky sharp into becky stupid .
the projectors in the theater practically shut down with boredom .
for the love of all things holy , we don 't need trash like this . it poisons the soul . it worsens the credibility of an already struggling industry . just stop .
laughably bad , mind-bogglingly derivative , and easily one of the worst movies of the year .
if crap movies carried penalties for inflicting torture on audiences , then rings would merit a death sentence .
a sequel to look who 's talking; the concept says it all .
it 's the worst of both worlds as disney cash cow miley cyrus makes the most dubious "dramatic" debut of any singer since britney spears .
tedious , amateurish and hilariously ill-timed . . .
it 's front-loaded with enough cameos from the likes of regis philbin and drew carey to sink most crappy comedies , and , indeed , this one finally makes it to an actual pleasure cruise , - the pleasure .

i don 't know how you defeat ghosts , but smacking them with a bat would not be my first guess .
adam sandler spends more time laughing at jokes than making them in grown ups , perhaps the slackest , shabbiest comedy in the star 's increasingly dreadful oeuvre .
joe dirt plays like a stupid saturday night live skit that refuses to die .
for a film so bent on naturalizing the presumably hilarious incongruity of "the sexes ," it sure features lots and lots of that site of horror: a naked male body . and for comedic purposes , of course .
the acting is abysmal , and the gloating depiction of violence is hard to take , unless you 're extremely thick and perverted .
appalling by pretty much every measure .
this is another miserable movie about women at war over nonsense .
. . .an almost epically unwatchable drama that stands as an obvious low point in the careers of both apted and hanson .
this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie i 've seen this summer .
i 'm shaking my head now like a caring teacher grading a poor assignment written by a bright student .
while i think it 's cute that people get all dressed up and have little parties going to this movie , the actual film is a hellish , embarrassing abomination .
when it 's not annoying , it 's cloying , and in both cases is so acutely irritating that one longs for the passive delights of mere tedium

holy isis and osiris! barely two months into the year and a strong contender for the worst film of 2016 has already appeared onscreen .
tony hale 's winning characterization of an improbably straightlaced suitor who woos the "quirky" annie saves the movie from total disaster .
it 's like a clive barker gore-fest as interpreted by an idiot carnival showman , robbed of anything that would make it work .
directors rob epstein and jeffrey friedman settle for a titillating , exploitative snapshot instead of a fully rounded portrait .
'murder of the musical ' would be a better name .
an absolutely abhorrent piece of work . . .

for every brilliant moment (for example , casting michael caine as austin 's father) , there are wads of blecch barring your finding it .
a vomitorium consisting of 93 minutes of tom green doing things that a geek in a carnival sideshow would turn down .
so sari , mike myers . your spoof of "bollywood" stinks .
it 's difficult to discern precisely where this all went wrong , and even more difficult to speculate about possible improvements .
the picture doesn 't even respect the movies it mocks enough to understand what it is about them that fails .
the director takes a step backwards with evolution , relying on potty humor and special effects to cover a dim-witted and derivative plot .

it 's like iron man , if tony stark had never stopped selling arms to the bad guys .
writer-director ron krauss 's gimme shelter is wretched long before its odious ulterior motives come to light .
everyone 's phoning it in for the first two hours . and let me point out something that i 've just said there: 'the first . two . hours . '
the spirit is two hours of your life that you 'll never get back .
superman , but he 's evil . that 's the whole movie . this is a depiction of violent entitled sociopathy that may think it 's critiquing toxic masculinity yet is indistinguishable from a celebration of it .
i hated just about every agonizing , smug minute of it .
pretentious , uninvolving headscratcher that aims to be tragic and uplifting and falls way short; the only thing it 'll lift is your butt from your seat midway through the film .
an offensive and obnoxious comedy that never feels secure in its own identity .
relates more or less the same story as spy kids , though in this case the kid is in his late 20s and the spy stuff is much less believable or robust .
utterly devoid of suspense , energy or credibility .
not only will you want to shower after seeing this repellent movie -- the rose-mikey sex scenes are especially icky -- you 'll feel sorry for the cast .
mrs . witherspoon is cast well below her considerable talents as an airhead bel air brat who has it all .
dolph 's probably still wondering why his star 's no longer shining .

i think it was after betty white told steve martin 's son not to "wear his hair like a ***" that i thought about walking out .
speaking of corporate malfeasance , fun with dick & jane cost a disgraceful $100 million -- approximately 33 times the price tag of the 1976 original .
it 's not a movie . it 's an adrenaline pump and purveyor of raw carnage .
the language and the points of view are disgusting . this is a film that is in such poor taste that it 's almost impossible to endure .
a comedy so listless , leisurely and unspirited that it was an act of the will for me to care about it , even while i was watching it .
oh yeah , the bee gees are much better than that other band .
as puppetry , team america is stilted . as satire , it 's gutless and lazy . and as comedy , it barely delivers laughs .
we snuck guiltily into the almost-empty theatre , already prepared to hate it . but we were ill prepared , all the same . . .we have nothing to sphere but sphere itself .
a partial list of things that are more amusing than big momma 's house 2: beverly hills cop , fletch , the original big momma 's house , every sitcom currently on tv , open-heart surgery .
among carpenter 's worst and that 's saying something .
not just bad , but weirdly , fascinatingly bad .
think animal house meets the revenge of the nerds and you have the essence of h .o .t .s . ' plot .
kim ki-duk 's film makes an exaggerated , undeserved show of its cruelty , indignity , and aspirations of importance .
lock them all up and throw away the key is what i say .
jewison 's rich and provocative 1975 original has been de-metaphorized , made narrow and pointless , while remaining just as loud and violent .
the characters are grossly incompetent , in addition to being vapid , and devoid of common sense . they each deserved what they get because each death meant the film was closer to ending .
even the outtakes during the end credits are utterly humorless .
it 's the dumberest movie i 've ever seen!
don 't encourage breillat by watching her self-indulgent , utterly unenjoyable and shallow little exposé .
lohan 's virgin/whore dons a robotic hand , the perfect prop to match her performance .
an ugly , revolting movie .

predictable . disposable . listless . boring . this is not how you make great horror films .

one of the vilest films of the 2000s .

queen latifah deserves a better vehicle than taxi .
no matter how much you paid or were paid to watch this capophagic mess , son , you been robbed .
there are very few movies i regret having wasted my time on or are completely disgusted by . "spring breakers" is the definition of disgusting . the characters had no substance and the storyline had nothing to offer .
what number is less than zero ?
a spectacularly scattershot , pandering mess of pulp junk , cheap-looking animation , and poisonous gender dynamics . a charmless cash-grab that can 't be bothered with the slightest stab at originality .
looks like 'transformers on speed: the autobots take japan . '
kansas . . .is a really terrible movie .
i can 't remember a year when there have been as many horrible movies . "beerfest" is the poster child for them . . .makes "talladega nights" look like hamlet .
the laughs never stop only because they never start . in fact , i can 't remember the last time i laughed so little .
