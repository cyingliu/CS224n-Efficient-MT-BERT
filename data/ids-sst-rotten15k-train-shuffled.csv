7842	r00013901	contrary to popular opinion , the best moment in the film isn 't when jimmy cagney shoves a grapefruit in his girlfriend 's face .	4
7843	330108835d623eaf1b089ec38	 While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .	1
7844	r00476592	the greatest triumph and biggest surprise of the film is that it is an lsd freak-out on par with 2001: a space odyssey .	4
7845	33fe3957f371b57af8f35b0ad	 Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .	4
