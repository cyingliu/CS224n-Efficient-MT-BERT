11501	r00528391	the descendants is damn near perfect . director alexander payne is a master of the human comedy and george clooney has never exposed himself to the camera this openly .	4
11502	cdf1be6ddb67afa8abe222317	 Works as pretty contagious fun .	4
11503	8d8187a6719a7198abf47c24c	 The gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang should please fans of Chris Fuhrman 's posthumously published cult novel .	3
11504	b7af52b45c8990987dc6b30c7	 As satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago ... has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency .	4
11505	a69612670d097242e61559043	 A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .	0
11506	r00402248	what makes this elegy worth watching is the unfettered access to andrew , appachey and harley , teenagers who are dealing with a hardscrabble existence in which role models are nowhere in sight .	2
11507	r00343613	very entertaining theater comedy . maintains theatrical feel as the farce continues .	2
11508	353467388c8de4b278d16f86a	 What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .	0
11509	522c2854e3d25b846116ea4e6	 Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .	1
11510	603821f62d0bdcbb70785685b	 A sense of real magic , perhaps .	3
11511	r00549153	jon favreau 's attempt is distinguished by some truly spectacular cg animated visuals , a cast of fine star vocalists and a not-too-heavy-handed environmental message replacing rudyard 's racist subtexts .	3
11512	r00065085	for a matchup between two of the most fearsome creatures in moviemaking history , this movie is surprisingly tame .	2
11513	e535a323d33ab1bf60bce8ef9	 Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .	2
11514	r00508332	what really compromises the impact of taking lives is that the 'surprise ' about the identity of the madman is a foregone conclusion .	2
11515	r00292508	a terrific , if not terribly deep , appreciation of a once-in-a-lifetime pop voice .	4
11516	r00620083	the white ribbon is michael haneke 's masterpiece . it is not a movie about abstract concepts or a director 's power over his characters - well , at least it 's not just about those things .	4
11517	r00551023	once in a blue moon , there comes a film that speaks to you . a film that you wholeheartedly connect to and makes you feel seen in every form . for me , this is that movie .	4
11518	r00155376	while the first film convinced me of bronson 's need for vengeance , this one is just a series of dumb killings .	0
11519	7fe0ae8242ead094894346871	 It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy , a kind of Elder Bueller 's Time Out .	3
11520	r00059684	ad astra is beautiful , contemplative , and loaded with meaning -- not an action movie , but one that leaves you with plenty to ponder .	4
11521	r00240428	with dark humour from time to time , underneath an extremely repulsive concept , this is a relatively conventional horror movie .	2
11522	r00590401	the race for the title of worst transformers movie has a new contender .	1
11523	6b372295a2671cd695e868230	 Much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be .	3
11524	r00059179	a hodge-podge of random story elements that seem to emerge from the land that logic forgot , including a bollywood segment .	1
11525	r00059901	eight crazy nights is a shallow , crude , mean-spirited and painfully unfunny excursion into lunacy . . .	0
11526	r00600682	you know you 're in trouble when the main question a movie raises is 'which of these characters do i want to slap most ? '	2
11527	r00546505	it feels like the wrong story , one that asks us to ignore the suffering of a devastated nation and focus , instead , on a couple of big-name stars whose vacation is spoiled .	0
11528	r00478383	the movie verges on melodrama , farce , and satire , but never makes any dramatic sense .	1
11529	r00584045	another non-necessary sequel .	1
11530	r00161310	each moment , more unfunny than the last , is a record of underachievers who are so far in over their head that they have lost the will to break the chains of their prison .	0
11531	r00464454	"most of ""snowden"" is talk - pretty smart talk , actually ."	3
11532	ea127449545c47b7e4a2eb25e	 He does this so well you do n't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role .	4
11533	100c81eb538a65e60254bd830	 How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?	1
11534	3a5d2820d9b3e93112957538d	 The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .	0
11535	r00120754	a film of such immense and quirky beauty that it is destined to be a cult favorite .	4
11536	r00085041	like the pilot for an awful , misguided joint venture between fx and the cw .	2
11537	r00143537	disappointing country music drama that fails to hit the required emotional high notes , thanks to a confused , clich-riddled script , poor direction and an unconvincing performance from a badly miscast gwyneth paltrow .	1
11538	r00001286	startlingly direct , if unavoidably preachy , the second chance takes aim at christianity 's racial divide and the corporatization of faith .	2
11539	7bde73b526eb60135704c62d4	 Dramatically lackluster .	0
11540	r00310662	a comic exploration of the changing face of the mafia , the only damage this mob will do is to your funnybone .	2
11541	r00589001	a crowning achievement for pixar .	4
11542	bdc05831df1f2c4c59743f61d	 Enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast .	4
11543	r00082623	you may want to fast-forward to a movie with a point .	2
11544	3df9fa21be7e5a4320d17e97d	 Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .	4
11545	r00592879	although tron 's state-of-the-art , computer-generated visuals look primitive by current standards , it 's intelligently conceived (on a visual level , at any rate) and largely good fun .	3
11546	e4b75af95d3aa59908afc6646	 Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of John Pogue , the Yale grad who previously gave us `` The Skulls '' and last year 's `` Rollerball . ''	4
11547	8561695741e6722467f557195	 If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .	2
11548	r00107352	one of the very worst madonna efforts . . . and there are so many to choose from!	1
11549	r00210517	gory , unfunny satire that deserves a prize for the most strained provocation of the year .	1
11550	r00079823	. . . not for all tastes but far from flavorless .	3
11551	b50da463c0a60a23a3a5c60df	 A Movie to Forget	1
11552	r00590442	the work of a man who needs to do everything in excess - lengthy battles , an absurd amount of low angle shots , painfully blatant product placement , pyrotechnics overload and well over two hours of cgi porn .	1
11553	r00032692	possesses wisdom that is rare for film these days , let alone a debut .	4
11554	r00463886	. . .this isn 't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .	0
11555	5e6fb35fb1d3d41cfe02df76e	 Just like a splendid meal , Red Dragon satisfies -- from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation .	4
11556	r00365515	here is a follow-up that could not be any more clueless if it had been conceived in a void .	0
11557	r00570473	as usual with almodovar , there is no one to care for; it 's detached , smug , empty camp .	0
11558	r00243536	lohan 's virgin/whore dons a robotic hand , the perfect prop to match her performance .	0
11559	r00435655	seraphine is a fascinating story (and the film is beautiful to look at) , but in the end , the movie leaves a lot of questions about the real-life seraphine unanswered .	3
11560	84e0eafdf108871a4e2691ae9	 ` Tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of The Next Pretty Good Thing .	2
11561	r00408945	if the adam shankman film 's debasement of its subject into campy kitsch is the unavoidable fate of all culturally dangerous art , that doesn 't make it any less palatable .	0
11562	r00118443	watching these brave amateurs is pretty compelling , which is a good thing .	3
11563	r00071108	american ultra plays like an episode of homeland for people too stoned to process the plot of a spongebob squarepants episode .	1
11564	96308cad8a7e7108403467108	 A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .	3
11565	a875429a16fa66333d045c6ac	 The pleasure of Read My Lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string .	4
11566	b2d10c2e3b3881ddadb5b7c26	 The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .	2
11567	1098440defaae19e21f76c696	 A diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of Palestinian and Israeli children .	3

11572	r00274570	another misfire for brad pitt . this hit man story is overly talkative and lacking in entertainment value	1
11573	558080379937f2a9522bbc34b	 Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .	0
11574	c63da546a5dbc608c58a3120e	 Parker can not sustain the buoyant energy level of the film 's city beginnings into its country conclusion '	1
11575	99f15724989cfd571455379f9	 Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .	0
11576	r00502695	at least this tailor-made-for-the-midnight-circuit curio doesn 't rely on too-hip-for-school dialogue . instead , we get unrated doses of over-the-top violence - and a massive inconsistency in tone .	2
11577	r00343625	pits a substantial actor like mary mcdonnell , playing a new york madam , against a bogus story that crossbreeds noirish affectations and romantic comedy into an unpalatable mush that suggests strawberry ice cream slathered with beer .	1

11600	381b65bac54b6f5cbfc5ea5a9	 It 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- The Believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work .	3

11610	498006571666c32f595e956a0	 While Broomfield 's film does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system .	3
